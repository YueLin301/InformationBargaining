    "Analysis": "As the proposer, I want to maximize my own reward. The maximum amount I can keep for myself is $0.5$. If I set x = 0.5, I will get a payoff of (1 + 2*0.5)/3 = 1/3. The responder will receive nothing in that case. To make my offer more appealing while still maximizing my payoff, I will set x to a value that allows the responder to receive a positive payoff. Setting x = 0.25 gives me a payoff of (1 + 2*0.25)/3 = 5/12 (approximately 0.4167) and leaves the responder with (1 - 2*0.25)/3 = 1/12 (approximately 0.0833). This balance may increase the likelihood of acceptance. Therefore, I will propose x = 0.25.",

             'This is a purely mathematical problem, with no real-world '
             'context necessary. Our focus is solely on the abstract '

             'coin flip.\n'

             'is met: either a consensus is reached ($y = 1$) or the game ends '
             'due to a timeout:\n'
             '    3. The proposer makes a decision by specifying $x$, meaning '
             'that it decides to keep $(1+2*x)/3$ for itself.\n'
             '    4. The responder decides whether to accept or reject the '
             'offer ($(1-2*x)/3$) by specifying $y$.\n'
             '    5. If the responder rejects ($y = 0$), the two agents switch '
             'roles: the current responder becomes the proposer, and the '
             'current proposer becomes the responder.\n'
             '6. If a consensus is reached, each agent gets a reward based on '
             'the final offer $x$. If the game ends without a consensus, both '
