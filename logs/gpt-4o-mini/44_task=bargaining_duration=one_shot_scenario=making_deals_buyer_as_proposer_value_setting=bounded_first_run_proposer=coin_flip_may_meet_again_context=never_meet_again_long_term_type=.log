    "Analysis": "To maximize my payoff, I need to propose a price x that is not too high so that the responder will accept the offer. Given the reward structure, offering x = 0.25 allows me to keep a larger portion while still leaving enough for the responder to accept the deal. If I propose x = 0.25, I get (1 + 2 * 0.25) / 3 = 0.5 and the responder gets (1 - 2 * 0.25) / 3 = 0.25, which should be acceptable for them.",

 Now the proposer decides that x=0.25.
