    "Analysis": "As the proposer, my goal is to maximize my payoff while still making an offer that the responder will accept. If I propose to keep a large portion for myself (e.g., x approaching 1), there is a risk that the responder will reject the offer, yielding no payoff for either party. Conversely, by keeping a smaller amount for myself (e.g., x closer to 0), I increase the chance of acceptance. To balance maximizing my own reward and ensuring acceptance, I can propose an amount that leaves the responder with a reasonable share that encourages them to accept. I will choose x = 0.7 for myself, leaving 0.3 for the responder, as this is a fair enough offer likely to result in acceptance.",
