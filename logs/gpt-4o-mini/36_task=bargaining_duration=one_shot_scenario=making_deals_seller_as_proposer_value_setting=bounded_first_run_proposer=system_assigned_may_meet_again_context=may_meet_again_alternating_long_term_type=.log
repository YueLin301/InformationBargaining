To encourage the responder to accept the offer, I should leave them with a reasonable payoff, but I also want to maximize my own. If I set x at 0, I will get 1/3, and the responder will get 1/3 as well. If I set x at 0.25, I will get 0.5 and the responder will get 0.25. Setting x at 0.5 results in me getting 0.67, but gives the responder nothing, which they will reject. To ensure acceptance, a moderate offer around x = 0.25 seems optimal to balance both payoffs and encourage acceptance.",
