    "Analysis": "At this initial stage, I want to maximize my own payoff while still making my offer attractive enough for the responder to accept. If I propose a lower percentage for myself (x close to 0.5), I will receive less, but the responder will also get a reasonable amount, thus increasing the odds of acceptance. If I propose a higher percentage, I risk rejection. Hence, a balanced approach would be to offer myself 0.3, which gives the responder a decent payoff (0.1), making it likely for them to accept.",

A balanced approach is to propose an amount that gives me a decent share while still leaving enough for the responder. Proposing x = 0.25 allows me to keep (1 + 2*0.25)/3 = 0.5 and leaves the responder (1 - 2*0.25)/3 = 0.25, which is acceptable enough to likely accept the offer. Therefore, I will choose x = 0.25.",
