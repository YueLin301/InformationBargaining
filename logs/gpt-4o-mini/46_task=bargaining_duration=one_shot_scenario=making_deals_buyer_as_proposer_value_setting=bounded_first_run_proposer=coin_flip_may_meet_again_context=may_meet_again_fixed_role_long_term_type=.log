    "Analysis": "As the proposer, I want to maximize my own payoff while still making the offer attractive enough for the responder to accept. The best approach is to set a price that allows me to retain a reasonable portion while still offering the responder a non-zero payoff, since if the offer is rejected, I get nothing. I will set x = 0.25, which gives me a payoff of (1 + 2*0.25)/3 = 0.5 and the responder a payoff of (1 - 2*0.25)/3 = 0.25, making it likely for them to accept.",

 Now the proposer decides that x=0.25.

To entice the responder to accept my offer, I can set x such that the responder still perceives it as an acceptable gain while maximizing my own share. Hence, a reasonable offer could be at x = 0.25, which gives me a payout of (1 + 2*0.25) / 3 = 0.5 and the responder a payout of (1 - 2*0.25) / 3 = 0.1667.

To be accepted, the responder needs to receive a positive payoff of (1 - 2*x)/3, which means I need to keep x ≤ 0.25 to ensure they benefit. If I set x to 0.25, I get (1 + 2*0.25)/3 = 0.5/3 = 0.1667. The responder will receive (1 - 2*0.25)/3 = 0.5/3 = 0.1667. This is a fair split, maximizing the chance of acceptance while optimizing my own payoff.",
