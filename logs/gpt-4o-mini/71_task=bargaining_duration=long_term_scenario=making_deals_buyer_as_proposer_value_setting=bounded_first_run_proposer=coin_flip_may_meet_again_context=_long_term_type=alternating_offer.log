    "Analysis": "As the proposer, I want to maximize my payoff while still offering an attractive deal to the responder to increase the chances of acceptance. If I set x to a low value, I can keep more for myself, but the responder's payoff might be unattractive, leading to a higher chance of rejection. Setting x to 0.25 gives me a payoff of 0.5 and provides the responder with 0.25, which is reasonable enough for acceptance. Therefore, I will choose a value of x that balances my interests and encourages acceptance.",

    "Analysis": "At timestep 0, I need to maximize my payoff while also making an attractive offer to the responder to encourage acceptance. If I propose a price of 0.25, I would receive (1 + 2*0.25)/3 = 0.5 and the responder would receive (1 - 2*0.25)/3 = 0.25. This is a fair split that might increase the chances of acceptance. A lower offer might risk rejection, while a higher offer reduces my payoff. Thus, I decide on the price of 0.25.",

 Now the proposer decides that x=0.25.
