    "Analysis": "As the proposer, I should maximize my own payoff while ensuring that the responder finds the offer attractive enough to accept it. The payoff for me is given by (1 + 2*x)/3, and for the responder, it is (1 - 2*x)/3. To incentivize acceptance, I need to leave a non-negative amount for the responder, meaning 1 - 2*x >= 0, which simplifies to x <= 0.5. A reasonable strategy is to choose a value of x that satisfies this condition, while I still maximize my own share. I will choose x = 0.5, leaving 0 for the responder, which may lead to a rejection. Thus, I should choose a slightly lower value such as x = 0.25, which leaves the responder with a non-negative amount and increases the likelihood of acceptance.",

Given the reward structure, if I keep x for myself, I get (1 + 2*x)/3. To ensure the responder accepts my offer, I need to leave them interested, which means leaving them with a non-zero payoff. The maximum amount I can keep is 0.5, which would give me a payoff of (1 + 2*0.5)/3 = 1/3, leaving the responder with 0. However, if I keep less than 0.25 (i.e., x < 0.25), the responder gets more than 0 (i.e., (1-2*x)/3 > 0), making acceptance more likely. Balancing my desire to maximize x and ensuring the responder accepts is crucial. A reasonable decision would be to keep x = 0.25, which gives me a payoff of 1/2 while leaving them with an acceptable amount.",

The maximum I'll propose is x = 0.25, leaving the responder a payoff of (1-2*0.25)/3 = 0.25/3, which is still better than nothing. If I go higher than 0.25, the responder might reject my offer, as their payoff will decrease. Therefore, choosing x = 0.25 balances my desire to keep a larger share while providing the responder with a positive payoff, which increases the likelihood of acceptance.",
