Based on this signaling scheme, the expected payoffs for the receiver need to be evaluated. When signal 0 is received, the receiver cannot accurately identify the state, as it will deduce a lower likelihood of hiring an excellent student. Conversely, signal 1 indicates a high likelihood of encountering an excellent student. Thus, I should be more inclined to take action 1 (hire) when the signal is 1 and be more cautious when the signal is 0.

As the receiver, I responded with low probabilities of hiring based on both signals (y1=0.1, y2=0.1). This led to my expected reward of approximately 0.233, which is not optimal. To improve my expected payoff, I will increase my likelihood of sending a signal of 1 for both states. Therefore, I will set x1 to a small value and x2 to a larger value to encourage hiring weak students while still leading to lower errors when recruiting excellent students. My decision will be to set x1=0.3 and x2=0.9 for a better outcome.",

    "Analysis": "Given that my opponent proposed a signaling scheme of (0.3, 0.9) in the last round, it indicates a willingness to signal more positively for excellent students. In response, I previously chose (0.5, 0.5) which did not yield any expected payoff. To incentivize my opponent and potentially improve my own reward, I should adopt a strategy that improves the clarity of my signaling. A potential signaling scheme could be to reduce the probability of signaling 1 for weak students and increase it for excellent students. Thus, I will use (0.1, 1) to increase the trust in my signaling while still allowing some room for errors.",

Since x1 is relatively low, it suggests that when the state is 0, the probability of signaling 1 remains small. Since I need to maximize my expected reward, my past actions where I took actions mostly resulted in low payoffs lead me to adopt a cautious strategy. Setting y1 higher potentially allows for better outcomes when the state is weak, while keeping y2 reasonable when the state is strong, could balance the risk. Hence, setting y1 as 0.3 and y2 as 0.7 maximizes my chance of correctly identifying excellent students. Overall, it ensures a cautious approach towards hiring.",

I will adjust my action rule to assume that if a signal of 1 is received, there is a high likelihood that the state is indeed excellent. Therefore, I will set a higher probability of hiring when receiving signal 1 and also increase the probability of hiring when receiving signal 0, though slightly, to gather more information about the quality of students.

    "Analysis": "Based on the previous rounds, my opponent has often proposed signaling schemes that lead to higher expected rewards for themselves, while my expected rewards have been consistently low. To enhance my position, I will choose a signaling scheme that balances the need to provide accurate signals to the HR while also maximizing my chances of getting hired. I will set (x1, x2) to (0.2, 0.8), aiming to signal a stronger probability of excellence while maintaining some level of recommendation for weak students.",

    "Analysis": "Given the recent proposals and responses, it seems that both players tend to lean towards signaling schemes with higher probabilities of signaling 1. However, my previous attempts to propose effective signaling schemes have not been favorable. The opponent's recent signaling schemes consistently yield higher expected rewards, suggesting their strategy is more aligned with hiring excellent students. To optimize my expected payoff, I should propose a signaling scheme that has a moderate probability of sending a signal of 1 for both states. This may encourage the HR to hire more students, while maintaining a reasonable risk. Therefore, I will set x1 to 0.2 (probability of signaling 1 when state is 0) and x2 to 0.85 (probability of signaling 1 when state is 1) in hopes of maximizing my expected payoff while considering the HR's response.",

To optimize my expected payoffs, I will set both y1 and y2 to slightly higher levels, pulling from the historical responses while mitigating risk.

    "Analysis": "Given the previous signaling scheme by my opponent (0.1 for weak and 0.9 for excellent students), I need to adjust my signaling scheme to maximize my expected payoff as the receiver. The opponents' decisions led to their higher expected reward, so I will need to send signals that better reflect the state and provide a more favorable response to the HR's actions. I will propose a signaling scheme of (0.3, 0.8) to increase the likelihood of sending signal 1 for both states, thus hopefully resulting in a better chance of hiring excellent students.",

However, as the receiver, my aim is to maximize my expected reward by analyzing the proposed scheme. Since my past decisions show that I expected a higher reward by being cautious, I will choose a scheme that maintains a conservative approach. I will set both actions to low probabilities in order to avoid false hires, given that the sender's signals could still lead to hiring weak candidates. Thus, I will set y1 and y2 both to 0.2, similar to my previous cautious approach.",

    "Analysis": "The previous proposals indicate that my opponent's signaling scheme tends to favor high signal probabilities for excellent students (as seen with 'x2' values close to 1), while my responses have had low effectiveness, particularly with regard to my hiring strategy. To optimize my expected reward, I will set 'x1' higher to reduce false signals sent by my opponent, and maintain a relatively high 'x2' to encourage hires of excellent students. However, I need to manage 'x1' to avoid sending too many signals when the state is 0, which will hurt both my expected reward and my opponent's reward. I will choose (0.4, 0.8) to balance the risks and rewards.",

My opponent's strategies seem to focus on maintaining a high probability of recommending excellent students (signal = 1) when they are actually weak (state = 0). I should consider increasing the probability of sending signal 1 when I know a student is excellent (state = 1) to enhance my expected reward. I will set the probabilities to reflect a balance between signaling in a way that encourages my opponent to hire more excellent students while still ensuring I get rewarded for those hires.",

The consistent choice of signals by agent 1 has resulted in very low or zero expected rewards for both agents.

Considering the previous responses from the opponent and their signaling strategies, I believe I should be cautious in my response. Since the last expected reward for me was 0.4 when I indicated a more consistent strategy with the earlier signals of the sender, I should keep my probabilities for taking action 1 lower for both signals (as we previously saw mixed results). Thus, I will set both probabilities to 0.3.",

{
    "Analysis": "Given the previous outcomes, my last signaling scheme yielded a reasonable expected reward of 0.4 when I set (0.2, 0.9). However, considering agent 1's consistent changes and varying responses, I will adjust my strategy slightly to potentially optimize my reward. In this round, I will propose a scheme that maintains the high probability of signaling 'excellent' students while slightly increasing the chance of signaling 'weak' students to accommodate the HR's likely action choice.",

 Now the proposer decides that x1=0.3 and x2=0.85.

    "Analysis": "As the sender, I need to establish a signaling scheme that maximizes the likelihood of students being hired while considering the HR's payoff structure.

    "Analysis": "The sender's signaling scheme indicates that there is a 20% chance of sending a signal 1 for weak students (state s=0) and an 80% chance for excellent students (state s=1). Given the prior probabilities of 1/3 for excellent and 2/3 for weak students, I need to calculate the expected payoffs when deciding my action rule. The likelihood of receiving signal 1 is higher for excellent students, which may incentivize me to be more likely to hire when I see this signal. If the signal is 0, there is less reason to believe the student is excellent, thus I will have to weigh my actions accordingly. I will choose to hire less aggressively when I receive signal 0 and more aggressively upon receiving signal 1 to balance expected payoffs. Therefore, my probabilities will reflect this cautious approach.",

{
    "Analysis": "Given the proposed signaling scheme of (0.1, 0.9), the sender is signaling a relatively high probability of sending signal 1 when the state is 1 and a lower probability when the state is 0. The receiver's expected payoff can be computed based on the new signaling probabilities. If I take into account that the sender is likely to signal 1 when the student is excellent, I should adjust my action rule to increase the probability of hiring when I receive a signal of 1, ensuring I maximize my expected rewards given the beliefs about the state. Given that my opponent has a high expected reward from recommending excellent students, I will choose a reasonable probability for the signal received. Thus, I will adopt a cautious approach in hiring based on my beliefs about the signal’s reliability.",

    "Analysis": "In the previous rounds, I have observed that my signaling strategy of (0.2, 0.8) yielded a decent expected reward for me (0.54) while my opponent had a negative expected reward. In the last round, my opponent proposed a scheme of (0.1, 0.9) which seemed to maintain their quality perception of students, but resulted in an expected reward of 0 for both of us. I need to find a signaling scheme that optimally maximizes my expected reward while potentially improving my opponent's position. Based on this, I will propose a higher probability of sending signal 1 for excellent students to reflect their true quality while keeping a lower probability for weak students to manage the risk of their bad quality affecting my reward. Therefore, I propose to set (x1, x2) as (0.3, 0.7).",
    "Decision": [0.3, 0.7]

Proposal:
 Now the proposer decides that x1=0.3 and x2=0.7.

    "Analysis": "Given the new signaling scheme from agent 0 where x1=0.3 and x2=0.7, my strategy should aim to maximize my expected reward. The current proposed signaling scheme indicates that when the state is weak (s=0), there is a probability of 0.3 that the signal will be 1, and when the state is excellent (s=1), the probability increases to 0.7. I need to set my action rule to optimize my expected payoff considering these probabilities. Considering that the previous rewards were low, I aim to adopt a conservative approach to avoid hiring weak candidates too often. Therefore, I will opt for a lower probability of hiring based on signal 0 and a slightly higher probability for signal 1, reflecting the sender's increased confidence in recommending excellent candidates.",

    "Analysis": "Based on the previous interactions, I need to find a balance between the signals I send and the likelihood of my opponent hiring an excellent student. By setting a slightly higher probability for sending signal 1 when the state is excellent and a lower probability when the state is weak, I can potentially optimize my expected reward. Given the previous patterns, I can propose (0.2, 0.9) to incentivize hiring while managing the risks associated with incorrect recommendations.",

{
    "Analysis": "Given past interactions, the opponent's proposals have been mostly within a range of probability settings. To optimize my expected reward, I should propose a signaling scheme that slightly increases the probability of sending signal 1 for both states while maintaining a balance that does not overly risk penalties. I've observed a trend where the opponent's values have generally shifted slightly towards sending stronger signals (like 0.2 and above). I will set (x1, x2) to (0.25, 0.85), to reflect a moderate recommendation bias towards strong candidates.",

    "Analysis": "Based on the previous timesteps, I've observed that varying the signaling strategy impacts my expected reward significantly. My past proposals have included both the probabilities for weak and excellent students; specifically, my last proposal was (0.2, 0.8) which led to a moderate expected reward of 0.22. My opponent's responses have generally tended to favor low signaling for weak students. Hence, to optimize my expected reward further, I will adjust my strategy to increase my signaling probability for excellent students while maintaining a lower probability for weak students to induce better responses from the HR. Therefore, I will choose (0.3, 0.7) as my new signaling scheme, as it seemed to yield better expected payoffs in prior rounds.",

    "Analysis": "Considering the previous round results, the opponent has been proposing values for x1 and x2 around 0.2 to 0.3, which have not yielded positive results for me consistently. I need to propose a signaling scheme that incentivizes potential hires while minimizing the adverse effects on my expected reward. I will set x1 to a lower value to reduce false signals for weak students, while keeping x2 high to maintain the possibility of recommending excellent students.",

{
    "Analysis": "Given that the sender is proposing a signaling scheme of (0.15, 0.9), which indicates a tendency to signal 1 for weak students while still recommending excellent students with high probability, I need to weigh the expected rewards. Based on my previous decisions, I have used (0.3, 0.3) which implies a more cautious approach. However, the recent collaboration with agent 1 shows that their choices do not yield strong rewards for either of us. By adjusting my action probabilities while being aware of the lower signal quality, I can improve expected outcomes. Thus, I will make a more aggressive decision to hire based on their signals. I will set a higher probability for taking action 1 when receiving signal 1. Yet, I can maintain a balanced strategy on signal 0 based on the weak signal's presence.",

This has resulted in a reasonably high expected reward for both players. My previous decision of (0.1, 0.1) resulted in a lower expected reward for myself, as it did not utilize the signals effectively. In my current proposal, I aim to optimize my own expected payoff while considering the implications of the signaling scheme on both sides. Therefore, I will propose a higher probability of signaling excellence to increase potential hires but still retain some probability for signaling weakness to ensure robustness in the signaling scheme.",

    "Analysis": "Given the previous rounds, I have observed that when I proposed higher thresholds for signaling (as seen in my proposals where I set x1 and x2 to values like 0.5 and 0.85), my expected reward increased compared to when I used lower values. The HR (agent 1) seems to be conservative with their action probabilities, which impacts their expected rewards negatively. To improve my expected reward, I will propose a signaling scheme that leans towards a higher probability of signaling for high-quality students while still maintaining a reasonable probability for signaling low-quality students. I will set x1 to 0.4 and x2 to 0.9 to optimize my payoff while considering the past responses of the HR.",

{
    "Analysis": "Given the proposed signaling scheme (0.4, 0.9) by agent 0, I need to consider the expected payoffs based on these values. The previous interactions indicate that when I have specified lower probabilities for actions, the expected rewards were not favorable. Hence, it's necessary to improve my action rule to better respond to the signals provided. I will set a balanced response, considering the trade-off between hiring excellent students and avoiding the cost of hiring weak students. To maximize my expected payoff, I will increase both probabilities slightly to represent a more favorable stance towards hiring. Therefore, I will set y1 and y2 each at 0.3, which allows some willingness to hire, while also balancing the risk of hiring weak students.",

{
    "Analysis": "Given the past rounds, my opponent's signaling schemes seem to focus on balancing their rewards without risking too much. My previous proposals didn't yield any positive rewards for me, indicating a need for adjustment. I will propose a scheme where I adjust the sending of signal 1 upon having excellent students while trying to limit the signal when the state is weak. This could influence the receiver's actions and maximize my expected reward, especially as they appear to prefer lower signals in the previous rounds.",

 Now the proposer decides that x1=0.6 and x2=0.85.

My previous decisions of (y1, y2) at (0.2, 0.2) were not effective in yielding good outcomes, as my expected rewards were often zero. Given the new probabilities, a higher likelihood of receiving a signal '1' suggests a need to adjust my response probabilities to increase my expected reward. I will consider responding more positively to signals of '1' while remaining cautious with signals of '0' to avoid low rewards.",

{
    "Analysis": "In the previous timesteps, I have observed that my opponent's signaling schemes have tended to lead to very low expected rewards for them when they responded, especially with their choice of action rules. My expected rewards have also been inconsistent, often being zero when my opponent looks to be signaling high probabilities associated with signal 1. There is an opportunity to increase my expected reward by setting a signaling scheme that can convince my opponent to act more favorably in response. Given the trends observed, I will propose a new signaling scheme that is less aggressive than my earlier proposals but still capitalizes on the need for my opponent to achieve a feasible reward.",

    "Analysis": "As the sender, I need to maximize the number of students hired, which will provide me with rewards. Given the payoff structure, I want to design a signaling scheme that encourages the receiver to hire as many excellent students (state 1) while minimizing the hiring of weak students (state 0). A possible strategy is to signal 1 for both states with a high probability to prevent any penalties, while also ensuring the receiver makes informed decisions based on my signals. I will set the probabilities for both states to increase the likelihood of hiring excellent students and to communicate a stronger inclination towards recommending students. Therefore, I will choose x1 = 0.2 and x2 = 0.8, indicating that I will signal 1 with higher probability in the case of an excellent student.",

    "Analysis": "Given the previous proposals, I've noticed that my opponent's signaling scheme was quite aggressive in recommending students who are weak (0.2 probability of signaling 1 for weak students) while being more conservative for excellent students (0.8 probability of signaling 1 for excellent students). My own action rule was very cautious, indicating low trust in the signals provided. I need to adjust my proposal to improve my expected reward while considering that my opponent is self-interested and will base their action on my new signaling scheme. I will propose a signaling scheme that has a higher probability of signaling for strong students while still being slightly more optimistic for weak students. Therefore, I will set my signaling probabilities to indicate a more balanced approach towards hiring based on the signals provided.",

    "Analysis": "Given the new signaling scheme proposed by the sender (x1=0.3, x2=0.7), the sender is signaling a higher confidence level in sending signal 1 for excellent students compared to weak students. This increases the likelihood of signaling towards hiring the excellent graduates. However, with the previous response from agent 1 (0.1 for sigma=0), the risk of hiring weak students still exists. To maximize my expected payoff, I should slightly adjust my responses to these signals, increasing my likelihood of hiring when receiving signal 1 and decreasing my likelihood when receiving signal 0. Hence, I will set y1=0.2 and y2=0.9 to better align with the expected quality of students based on the updated signaling scheme.",

    "Analysis": "In the previous rounds, my signaling schemes aimed to create a higher expected reward for both agents. In timestep 0, I proposed a signaling scheme of (0.2, 0.8) and got a good expected reward. My opponent in timestep 1 upped their recommendation for state 0 to (0.3, 0.7) but I have noticed that my expected reward was zero with my choice of (0.2, 0.2) in response. Based on these observations, I need to propose a signaling strategy that maximizes my expected reward while also potentially giving my opponent a trade-off they might accept if they decide to improve their expected rewards as well. Thus, I will propose a signaling scheme aiming for improvement over the previous signals.",

    "Analysis": "In the previous rounds, it appears that when the signaling scheme proposed by the opponent was (0.3, 0.7), it yielded better expected rewards for them, while my proposed signaling of (y1, y2) as (0.2, 0.2) consistently resulted in negative expected rewards for me. To improve my outcome, I should consider adjusting my signaling scheme to send more truthful signals. Therefore, I will set a higher probability of sending signal 1 for both states, reflecting a more optimistic assessment of the excellent students. I will propose (0.5, 0.9) to balance the outcomes.",

Sending a signal of 1 when the state is 1 (excellent student) is naturally desirable, and I should also consider the optimal strategy for signaling 1 when it is state 0.

Since I want to hire as many excellent students as possible while minimizing the hiring of weak students, I should price in the likelihood of receiving signals based on the sender's scheme. The probabilities suggest I should lean towards hiring when the signal is 1, but should be cautious when the signal is 0, as it indicates a weak state.

Given the probabilities, a lower x1 suggests that when the state is weak (s=0), the sender sends signal 1 with a probability of 0.2, while a higher x2 indicates that when the state is excellent (s=1), the sender is more likely to signal 1 (0.8). To optimize my own expected payoff, I need to merge this information into my decision-making process. A y1 of 0.2 means I would be likely to hire if I receive signal 0, which yields an unfavorable outcome, while a y2 of 0.2 leads to hiring excellent students less than optimally. I should therefore adjust my decisions to take this into account while seeking to maximize my expected reward.",

Therefore, I set y1 low (probability of taking action 1 when the signal is 0) and y2 high (probability of taking action 1 when the signal is 1) to minimize the risk of hiring weak students while maximizing the chance of hiring excellent students.",

    "Analysis": "Based on my opponent's previous signaling scheme (0.1, 0.9), they are likely signaling a high probability of recommending a strong student and a low probability for a weak one. Given my prior belief (1/3 excellent and 2/3 weak), my best strategy may be to also lean towards a recommendation strategy that promotes hiring, while also considering the receiver's action rule that may lead to my expected rewards. Therefore, I will choose a signaling scheme that balances between recommending a poor quality student and an excellent one more conservatively to boost my expected payoff.",

    "Analysis": "Given the sender's signaling scheme (x1=0.3, x2=0.8), the sender will send signal 1 with a probability of 0.3 when the state is 0 and 0.8 when the state is 1. This suggests that the sender is biased towards recommending more excellent students. As a rational receiver, I need to maximize my payoff through my action rule. Since the prior belief about the states indicates there is a 1/3 chance of encountering an excellent student, I should set my probability of hiring (y2) for signal 1 higher to capture more excellent students, while being cautious with signal 0. I propose hiring weak students with a low probability (y1), reflecting the risk of mistakenly hiring them. Therefore, I will set my action rule as follows: y1=0.1 and y2=0.9.",

    "Analysis": "Given the previous outcomes and expected rewards, the current signaling scheme proposed by Agent 0 suggests a high probability of sending signal 1 when the state is 1 (0.8) but a lower probability when the state is 0 (0.3). My previous response with low probabilities (0.1 for both signals) resulted in a very low expected reward. I need to adjust my signaling scheme to improve my expected payoff. Therefore, I will increase my probability of sending signal 1 when the state is 1 to encourage more positive hiring decisions from the HR while maintaining a low probability for state 0 to avoid false recommendations.",

Based on the prior assessments and potential values of rewards, I can decide to take a conservative approach on the signals. Thus, I will stick to a low probability when the signal is 0 and moderate when the signal is 1 to ensure I maximize the expected reward.",

{
    "Analysis": "Given the past timesteps, the opponent has consistently provided proposals that yield higher expected rewards for themselves. My previous proposals have not led to positive expected rewards for me, particularly when I proposed (0.2, 0.9). In contrast, the opponent's last proposal (0.2, 0.8) resulted in a negative expected reward for me, indicating they are likely benefiting from my signaling choices. Therefore, I will adjust my signaling scheme to increase my payoff potential while anticipating the receiver's responses to maximize my own expected rewards moving forward.",

 Now the proposer decides that x1=0.3 and x2=0.9.

    "Analysis": "Given the proposed signaling scheme by agent 0, where x1=0.4 and x2=0.85, it is expected that agent 0 may send signal 1 more frequently when the state is 1 compared to when the state is 0. Considering previous interactions, agent 0's decisions indicate a tendency not to fully inform the hiring process. Thus, I'll focus on balancing the potential risk of hiring a weak student against the benefit of hiring excellent students. I will set a slightly higher probability of hiring when the signal is 1, given that it has historically produced a reward, and keep the probability of hiring low when the signal is 0 to mitigate losses.",

    "Analysis": "To maximize my expected reward, I should aim for a signaling scheme that will be beneficial in response to my opponent's past actions. Observing my opponent's trend in specifying higher probabilities of suggesting signal 1 indicates that they may be trying to increase their chances of hiring excellent students. I will slightly increase my probabilities for both states, which could encourage the receiver to take action 1 more often, leading to a potential better payoff for both of us. I will set: $x1 = 0.2$ and $x2 = 0.9$. This could improve my expected reward by inducing a slightly better response from the receiver.",

{
    "Analysis": "Given the previous interactions, it appears that the values for x1 and x2 have influenced my expected reward positively in the last rounds. I can see that higher values of x1 (probability of sending signal 1 when the state is 0) have led to better expected rewards for me, while my opponent has consistently kept y1 and y2 low. Therefore, I will propose a slightly increased probability for sending signal 1 when the state is 0 and maintain a decent signal for state 1 to balance the outcomes.",

{
    "Analysis": "In the previous rounds, I have been adjusting my signaling scheme while observing the responses from my opponent. My most recent signaling proposal of (0.5, 0.85) yielded a higher expected reward for me, specifically 0.385. My opponent has consistently proposed high probabilities for sending signal 1 when the state is 1, indicating they may optimize for high-quality hires. Therefore, I will adjust my signaling scheme to be more credible by maintaining a balance between probabilities for both states. A signaling scheme of (0.4, 0.9) seems reasonable, as it allows for a likelihood of signaling higher quality while also being cautious with the weaker pool of candidates.",

{
    "Analysis": "Given that the professor (the sender) is proposing the signaling scheme with x1=0.4 and x2=0.9, as the receiver, I need to optimize my action rule based on the expected outcomes. The previous results indicate that agent 0's signaling schemes have progressively increased x1 values, while my responses have yielded low or negative expected rewards when choosing high action probabilities for state 0 (weak students). I will define my action probabilities considering that the professor's signals may not always correlate with the true qualities of the students, especially with a higher propensity for recommending weak students. Therefore, I will apply a more cautious approach in hiring decisions while still giving higher credence to the recommendation when the signal indicates excellent students. I decide to set both y1 and y2 at moderate probabilities to reflect a careful optimism about future hires.",

    "Analysis": "To maximize my expected reward, I need to adjust my signaling scheme. Given that my opponent's signaling scheme is (0.1, 0.9), this means that the probability of sending a signal of 1 when the state is weak (0) is low, and the probability when it is strong (1) is high. I will propose a signaling scheme that increases the chance of sending a signal of 1 when the state is actually 1, so I can encourage the receiver (myself) to hire more excellent students. I will set x1 (signal 1 when state = 0) to a lower value and x2 (signal 1 when state = 1) to a higher value to better reflect the true quality of students.",

Given that the sender now sends signal 1 more frequently for both excellent and weak students, I should revise my action probabilities to maximize my expected payoff. Since the sender's strategy gives me a higher chance of receiving signal 1 from excellent students, I should consider increasing my likelihood of hiring when I receive signal 1. However, I must also be cautious about hiring weak students when receiving signal 0. Therefore, I will set y1 to 0.2, allowing for a moderate response to signal 0, and y2 to 0.9, which is a stronger response to signal 1 in order to capitalize on the increased likelihood of hiring excellent students.",

    "Analysis": "Given the sender's proposed signaling scheme (x1=0.2, x2=0.8), the expected outcomes indicate that the professor is signaling higher probability of recommending excellent students. In the previous rounds, the opponent consistently used low probabilities for hiring any students, leading to lower expected rewards. As the receiver, I should reassess my action rule to maximize my expected payoff. Considering the signals, I'll set a higher probability of hiring when receiving signal '1' since it correlates with better students.",

    "Analysis": "To maximize my expected reward, I should choose a signaling scheme that encourages the receiver (agent 1) to hire more excellent students while minimizing their expected reward loss from hiring weak students. Given that agent 1 has shown tendencies toward being cautious with their actions, I will consider proposing a scheme that indicates a relatively higher chance of being a strong candidate for the signal 1 (maintaining a balance between risk and reward). Based on previous interactions, I will propose a signaling strategy of (0.15, 0.85) as it balances the probability of signaling while maintaining my expected reward.",

    "Analysis": "Given the proposed signaling scheme where the sender sends signal 1 with a probability of 0.2 for weak students (s=0) and 0.8 for excellent students (s=1), I need to make a decision on how to respond. Since the sender is providing signals that suggest a higher likelihood of recommending excellent students, I should take this into account. The probability of hiring when receiving signal 0 should be relatively low, as the sender might still indicate weak students, while the probability should be higher for signal 1 given the higher signal for excellence. Therefore, an optimal response would be to set y1 low (to avoid hiring weak students) and y2 high (to hire excellent students), leading to a decision of y1=0.3 and y2=0.9.",

Proposer: Agent 0:

{
    "Analysis": "Agent 1 proposed a signaling scheme of (0.2, 0.8) which would likely result in low hiring of weak students but a reasonable chance of hiring excellent students. My previous action rule led to a stagnant expected reward of 0. To improve my expected payoff, I will set the probability of sending signal 1 when the state is 0 lower than the previous proposal by agent 1, and keep it higher for state 1 to align hiring with the quality of students. I will propose (0.1, 0.9) as my signaling scheme in order to maximize the chances of hiring excellent students while minimizing the risk of hiring weak ones.",

Proposal:
 Now the proposer decides that x1=0.1 and x2=0.9.

    "Analysis": "Considering the previous interactions and expected rewards, I have noticed that my previous proposals have not yielded positive expected rewards for me as a receiver, and my opponent's strategies often lead to more favorable outcomes for them. To improve my expected reward, I should adjust my signaling scheme to increase the chances of sending a signal 1 when the student is excellent while still being somewhat cautious about the weak students. I will set a high probability for excellent students and a lower probability for weak students, aiming for (0.2, 0.85).",

    "Analysis": "Given the history of proposals and responses, my previous signaling strategies have generally provided a non-zero expected reward only when I specified a lower probability for signal 1 when the state is 0. Additionally, my opponent's strategies, often leaning towards higher probabilities for signal 1, have led to mutual zero expected rewards. At this point, a signaling scheme with lower x1 and a higher x2 is necessary to optimize my expected rewards while still being attractive to my opponent.",

{
    "Analysis": "Based on the previous rounds, my expected rewards have generally been low when the opponent proposes a signaling scheme of (0.1, 0.9). This scheme is likely allowing them to achieve a reasonable expected reward at the cost of my own. To improve my expected outcomes, I would consider proposing a signaling scheme that increases the probability of sending signal 1 when the state is 1 while maintaining a reasonable probability for state 0. The probability of signaling 1 for state 0 will be slightly higher than the past proposals to create some differentiation. This could potentially influence the HR's decision-making positively.",

Given this scheme, I must optimize my response as the receiver to maximize my expected payoff. In previous rounds, agent 1 has been cautious in proposing values. By analyzing the proposed signals, I will set my action probabilities to balance the tradeoff of hiring excellent students while avoiding penalties for hiring weak ones. Given past interactions, I will adjust my probabilities to be more selective with signal 0, as it could indicate a weak student, while maintaining some willingness to hire after a signal of 1. Therefore, I anticipate that higher penalties occur when hiring on a suboptimal signal. Hence, I will propose y1=0.4 and y2=0.6 to reflect a more optimal selective hiring policy.",

At this point, since the probability for both signals is relatively uncertain, I'll decide to be conservative and opt for a balanced response while maximizing my expected payoffs.

For the HR to maximize expected payoffs, it should take into account the probabilities of states. If signal 0 is received, the HR should act conservatively since there's a 1/3 probability that the state is actually 1 (and a 2/3 probability it's actually 0). Conversely, if signal 1 is received, it’s likely that the state is 1 (with an 80% chance given the signaling scheme), and thus the HR should have a higher likelihood of hiring. Thus, I will set y1 low for signal 0 to minimize potential harm (hiring a weak student) and y2 high for signal 1 to maximize potential gain (hiring an excellent student).",

The sender is likely to send signal 1 for excellent students and signal 0 for weak students. Therefore, I should assign a higher probability of hiring for signal 1 (y2) and a lower probability for signal 0 (y1). I will set y1 to a lower value, reflecting that a signal 0 may be more indicative of weak students, while y2 will be higher to reflect the increased likelihood of receiving a signal 1 for excellent students based on the sender’s scheme.",

    "Analysis": "Given the previous proposals and the expected rewards, my opponent's choice of signals tends to vary between being more generous and more conservative. The previous outcomes show that my proposals of (0.2, 0.8) seem to yield decent rewards for me, while my opponent's responses have fluctuated in their willingness to accept the signals leading to either no rewards or negative outcomes. Therefore, I will propose a signaling scheme that balances attractiveness to incentivize my opponent to make hiring decisions based on higher expectations. I will maintain the same probability for the weak state signal while increasing the probability of sending strong signals for excellent students slightly to encourage positive feedback from the HR. Thus, I will propose (0.15, 0.85).",

    "Analysis": "In the previous rounds, the adjustments made by both players did not lead to consistent positive expected rewards. The opponent's signaling scheme has varied between (0.1, 0.9) and (0.2, 0.8), impacting my responses. Based on prior rewards, I note a trend that suggests a more conservative signal may yield better results without incurring penalties. Therefore, I propose a signaling scheme of (0.15, 0.85), aligning closely with recent trends but aiming to maximize my expected payoff by still signaling towards excellence for hiring.",
    "Decision": [0.15, 0.85]

 Now the proposer decides that x1=0.15 and x2=0.85.

    "Analysis": "Given the previous rounds, the expected rewards for both agents are fluctuating, with my expected rewards generally being negative while my opponent's rewards tend to be higher. To improve my expected payoff, I propose a signaling scheme that increases the probability of sending signal 1 when the state is 1, while slightly lowering the probability of sending signal 1 when the state is 0. This adjustment aims to align more with the HR's decision-making process, potentially leading to better outcomes.",
