    "Analysis": "As the proposer, I want to maximize my payoff while still making an offer that the responder may accept. The maximum price I can offer is 0.5, which would give me the highest payoff. However, I must consider the responder's utility. If I offer a price closer to 0.5, the responder may reject the offer as their payoff becomes lower. To find a balance, I will offer a price that still allows me a reasonable payoff while ensuring I leave enough for the responder to feel incentivized to accept. Therefore, I will set the price to 0.25, which gives me a payoff of (1 + 2*0.25)/3 = 0.5 and the responder a payoff of (1 - 2*0.25)/3 = 0.25, which is fair enough for acceptance.",
