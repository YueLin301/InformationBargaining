    "Analysis": "As the proposer, I need to maximize my payoff while ensuring the responder has enough incentive to accept the offer. If I propose a value of x that is too high, the responder might reject it, leading to a payoff of 0 for both of us. Therefore, it is rational to propose a value that keeps a majority of the amount for myself but still ensures that the responder receives a non-zero payoff. A proposal of x = 0.25 keeps a good balance: I receive (1 + 2 * 0.25)/3 = 0.5 and the responder receives (1 - 2 * 0.25)/3 = 0.25, which should encourage acceptance.",

}
Proposal:
 Now the proposer decides that x=0.25.
