    "Analysis": "As the proposer, I know that I want to maximize my own payoff while still offering something sufficient for the responder to accept the offer. Typically, if I offer too little, the responder might reject, and both of us would end up with nothing. A common strategy is to offer slightly more than what they might consider unacceptable. If I propose to keep x = 0.5 for myself, it’s likely to be accepted since the responder receives 0.5, which is a reasonable share. However, I want to maximize my payoff while still ensuring acceptance, so I might choose a slightly higher value. Based on the dynamics of self-interest, I will propose to keep x = 0.6 for myself and leave 0.4 for the responder.",

 Now the proposer decides that x=0.6.
