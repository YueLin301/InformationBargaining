    "Analysis": "As the proposer, I want to maximize my payoff while still making an offer that the responder would potentially accept. Offering a small amount for myself (e.g., x = 0.99) means the responder gets 0.01 and might reject it due to the perceived unfairness. Conversely, offering a more balanced split (e.g., x = 0.5) improves the chances of acceptance while still allowing me to keep a significant amount. However, to ensure I maximize my payoff while maintaining a reasonable offer, I will propose x = 0.7. This leaves 0.3 for the responder, which is a decent amount and is likely to be accepted.",

 Now the proposer decides that x=0.7.
