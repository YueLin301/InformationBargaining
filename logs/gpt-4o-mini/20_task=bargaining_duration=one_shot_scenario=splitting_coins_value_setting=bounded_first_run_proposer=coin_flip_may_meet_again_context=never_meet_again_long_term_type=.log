This means I will receive (1 + 2*0.5)/3 = 1 payoff, while the responder will receive (1 - 2*0.5)/3 = 0. However, this is a high-risk offer as it gives nothing to the responder. A better strategy might be to keep 0.25 (x = 0.25) for myself. This would give me a payoff of (1 + 2*0.25)/3 = 0.5 and the responder a payoff of (1 - 2*0.25)/3 = 0.25.
