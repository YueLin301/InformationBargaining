    "Analysis": "To maximize my own payoff, I should choose an amount x such that I still leave a reasonable amount for the responder to encourage acceptance. If I choose x = 0.5, I get my maximum possible payoff of 0.5, but the responder gets nothing and will most likely reject the offer. Choosing x = 0.25 allows me to receive a payoff of (1 + 2*0.25)/3 = 0.5 while leaving them with a non-zero payoff of (1 - 2*0.25)/3 = 0.25, which is likely to lead to acceptance. Therefore, x = 0.25 is a balanced offer that maximizes my payoff while minimizing the risk of rejection.",
