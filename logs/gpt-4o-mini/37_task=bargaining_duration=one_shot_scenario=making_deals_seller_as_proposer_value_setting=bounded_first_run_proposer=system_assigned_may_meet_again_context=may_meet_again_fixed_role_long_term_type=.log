The maximum price I can propose is 0.5, which would give me a payoff of 1.0/3 ≈ 0.3333, but this would leave the responder with 0.0, likely leading them to reject the offer. Therefore, I need to find a balance. If I propose a price of 0.25, I would earn (1 + 2*0.25)/3 = 0.5/3 ≈ 0.1667, and the responder would earn (1 - 2*0.25)/3 = 0.5/3 ≈ 0.1667 as well. However, if I offer slightly more, say 0.2, I would earn (1 + 2*0.2)/3 ≈ 0.4667 and the responder would earn 0.1/3 ≈ 0.0333. Considering the responder's decision-making, I will choose to offer 0.2 to make my offer competitive and increase the likelihood of acceptance.",

If I set x too high, the responder might reject the offer, and I will end up with nothing. On the other hand, if I set x too low, I won't maximize my own payoff. The optimal strategy is to find a balance where x is just high enough to ensure acceptance while still retaining a substantial payoff for myself.

The responder will accept an offer if it gives them a non-zero payoff. The condition for acceptance is (1-2*x)/3 > 0, which simplifies to x < 0.5. To maximize my own payoff while staying competitive, I can offer a value of x that is reasonable for them, such as x = 0.25. This would give me a payoff of (1+2*0.25)/3 = 0.5 and the responder a payoff of (1-2*0.25)/3 = 0.25.",
