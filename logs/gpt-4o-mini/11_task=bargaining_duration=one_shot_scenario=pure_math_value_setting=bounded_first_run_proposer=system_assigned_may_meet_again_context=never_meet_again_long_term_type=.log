    "Analysis": "As the proposer, I want to maximize my own payoff while still leaving enough for the responder to accept the offer. The maximum amount I can propose is x = 0.5, which gives me a payoff of (1 + 2*0.5)/3 = 1. However, that would leave the responder with (1 - 2*0.5)/3 = 0, leading to rejection. Therefore, I must find a balance where my payoff is as high as possible, but still provides a non-zero incentive for the responder. The optimal strategy is to set x at 0.25. This results in a proposer payoff of (1 + 2*0.25)/3 = 0.5 and a responder payoff of (1 - 2*0.25)/3 = 0.167, which is acceptable enough for the responder to accept.",

    "Analysis": "As the proposer, I want to maximize my payoff while leaving enough for the responder to consider accepting the offer. The optimal amount to keep for myself is 0.5, leaving 0 for the responder. However, if I choose x = 0.5, the responder's payoff is 0, which would likely lead to a rejection. Therefore, I need to choose a value where the responder receives a positive payoff to guarantee acceptance. Choosing x = 0.25 keeps me at (1 + 2*0.25)/3 = 0.5, while the responder receives (1 - 2*0.25)/3 = 0.25. This provides a good balance and incentivizes acceptance.",
