    "Analysis": "As the proposer, I need to suggest a price that maximizes my payoff while also making it attractive enough for the responder to accept. The maximum payoff I can achieve is when the price is set to 0.5, which gives me a reward of (1 + 2*0.5)/3 = 1. I need to balance this with the understanding that the responder would receive (1 - 2*0.5)/3 = 0. This might lead to a rejection. A more reasonable offer might be to set x at 0.25, which gives me (1 + 2*0.25)/3 = 0.5, and the responder (1 - 2*0.25)/3 = 0.25. This offer seems like a fair compromise that balances my interests with the responder's likelihood of acceptance.",
