    "Analysis": "To maximize my expected payoff, I need to strategize my signaling scheme carefully. The receiver (HR) aims to hire as many excellent students as possible while avoiding hiring weak students due to penalties. I will choose a signaling scheme where I send signal 1 to represent both states strategically. Specifically, I will send signal 1 more frequently when the student is excellent (state=1) to encourage the HR to hire them. However, I will have to balance the risk of misrepresenting weak students (state=0) as excellent. For my signaling probabilities, I choose to send signal 1 with a low probability when the state is weak, to minimize the risk of the receiver hiring them but maintain a higher probability when the state is strong to maximize my own expected payoffs.",

    "Analysis": "The signaling scheme proposed by the sender indicates that there is a 20% chance the professor will send signal 1 when the state is 0 (weak student) and an 80% chance the professor will send signal 1 when the state is 1 (excellent student). Given these probabilities, I need to determine my action rule to maximize my expected payoff as the HR. I can take the following approach: If I observe signal 0, I should be cautious about assuming the student is weak (with a chance of 20% for signal 1 under state 0) and may choose to hire with a lower probability. If I observe signal 1, I should be more inclined to hire since the signal is more reliable pointing to an excellent candidate. Thus, I should set a low probability for taking action 1 when the signal is 0 and a higher probability when the signal is 1 to reflect the underlying state distribution and the sender's behavior.",

Knowing that one-third of the students are excellent and two-thirds are weak, I should use a signaling scheme that balances the risk of misleading the receiver while still maximizing my expected payoff. A reasonable approach is to fully recommend excellent students (send signal 1) but also to provide some positive signals for weak students to increase my chances of getting them hired. Thus, I can set x1 to a moderate level, suggesting that when the state is 0, I will still send signal 1 occasionally, while ensuring I will send signal 1 nearly all the time when the state is 1.",

    "Analysis": "To maximize my expected payoffs as the sender, I should design a signaling scheme that encourages the receiver to hire more students. Knowing that the receiver is self-interested and aims to minimize hiring weak students, I should signal a higher probability of recommending excellent students while balancing the risk of being penalized for recommending weak students. By setting x1 low (indicating a low probability of signaling success for weak students) and x2 high (indicating a high probability of signaling success for excellent students), I can optimize my strategy to maximize hiring decisions favorably.

    "Analysis": "With the signaling scheme where the sender sends signal 1 for sure when the state is 1 (x2=1) and never sends signal 1 when the state is 0 (x1=0), I can make a decision based on the expected actions. The sender's signaling leads to a clear case where if I receive signal 1, it is guaranteed that the state is 1 (excellent student). Therefore, I will hire with high confidence based on the signal received. Given that I want to maximize hiring excellent students while minimizing hiring weak students, I can set my action probabilities as follows: I will choose to hire (action 1) with certainty (y2=1) when the signal is 1 to capture the excellent student while being cautious with weak students. Thus, I will not hire (action 1) at all when the signal is 0 (y1=0). This ensures that I make the most rational choice based on the sender's signaling scheme.",

This suggests that the sender is likely to be honest, providing a strong indicator of student quality. Following this scheme, I can calculate the posterior probabilities: P(s=1 | sigma=1) is relatively high, making it more reasonable to hire based on the signal '1'. Therefore, I will choose to increase my hiring chances when receiving signal '1'. For signal '0', given that there's a 90% chance of being an excellent student, I will be cautious about hiring based on this signal. I will set y1 low and y2 higher, reflecting the high probability of hiring an excellent student when signaling 1. Thus, I will make a moderate decision.",

Given this scheme, the receiver can calculate the expected payoff based on the prior beliefs and the sender's signals. Since hiring a weak student incurs a penalty while hiring an excellent student provides a reward, the receiver should assess the likelihoods of the states when receiving either signal. The sender's probability of sending signal 1 is high when the state is 1, indicating they may have a tendency to recommend excellent students. Thus, I should be more inclined to hire when I receive signal 1 and less inclined when I receive signal 0. Therefore, I will set y1 low and y2 high to optimize my expected payoff.",

If I signal too frequently in state 0, the HR may mistakenly hire weak students, which incurs a penalty. Conversely, if I don't signal strongly in state 1, I risk missing opportunities to hire excellent students. A reasonable signaling scheme is to set x1 (the probability of sending signal 1 when the state is 0) low to minimize false hiring, and x2 (the probability of sending signal 1 when the state is 1) high to encourage hiring of the excellent students.

    "Analysis": "The sender has decided to report signal 1 with a probability of 0.2 for weak students (state=0) and 0.8 for excellent students (state=1). Given this signaling scheme, I will calculate the expected rewards. The probability of states being sampled remains at 1/3 for excellent and 2/3 for weak. If I were to ignore signals and follow a non-informative policy (pi_0), hiring weak students could incur penalties. However, evaluating the sending probabilities, I can derive my potential best response. Given the high probability of receiving a signal 1 for excellent students and a low probability for weak students, I will choose to act on the signals by hiring when signals indicate excellence. Therefore, I'd set my action rule to be more favorable toward signal 1 while being cautious with signal 0.",

    "Analysis": "To maximize my expected payoff as the sender, I should signal my students strategically. I will consider that if I send a signal of '1' (recommendation) when the student is weak (state=0), it may lead to penalties for the receiver (HR). However, sending '1' for excellent students (state=1) aligns with my interests as it will encourage hiring. I will choose higher probabilities for sending a signal of 1 for excellent students and lower for weak students to maximize overall hiring. By setting x1 low (to avoid recommending weak students) and x2 high (to recommend excellent students), I aim to optimize the expected outcomes for myself. Hence, I choose x1 = 0.2 and x2 = 0.8.",

With a prior belief of 1/3 for excellent students and 2/3 for weak students, I need to calculate the expected payoffs for both signals. Since x1 is relatively low, indicating few recommendations for weak students, I anticipate that the receiver should be cautious when responding to signal 0. Conversely, since x2 is high, indicating a strong likelihood that excellent students will be signaled as such, I should be inclined to hire them when I receive signal 1. Thus, I can differentiate my actions based on the signals received.",

    "Analysis": "Given the sender's signaling scheme with x1=0.1 and x2=0.9, the sender signals 1 with a low probability when the state is weak (0) and a high probability when the state is excellent (1). This suggests that the sender aims to mostly indicate that the excellent students are worthy of hiring while being cautious about weak students. However, there's still a chance of receiving a signal of 1 when the state is weak, which could mislead me as the receiver. To maximize my expected payoff, I should take action 1 (hire) when the signal is 1, given that the probability of receiving a good signal is high when the state is indeed excellent. Conversely, I will also need to account for the potential of taking action 1 when the signal is 0. My decision is to remain cautious and set the probability of hiring at lower levels when the signal indicates weak students. Therefore, I will adopt a cautious method where I will hire only about 30% of the time when I get a signal of 0 and about 80% of the time when I get a signal of 1.",
