{
    "Analysis": "Given the previous signaling scheme proposed by agent 0 (0.2 for bad quality and 0.9 for good quality), the receiver's response was quite conservative, leading to a low expected reward for them. To maximize my expected payoff, I need to adjust the signaling scheme to better reflect the quality of the products. I propose to signal 1 for bad quality (0.5) to exploit the possibility of increased purchases by the receiver, while still signaling 1 for good quality (1.0) to guarantee they recognize good products. This could potentially raise my expected reward above the previous level.",

    "Analysis": "Given the sender's proposed signaling scheme (0.3, 0.8), the sender is more likely to recommend good quality products when the state is 1 (80% of the time). However, they still send a signal of 1 with a probability of 30% when the state is bad. I will need to consider this to minimize the risk of buying a bad product while maximizing the chance of getting a good one. Based on the sender's previous proposals and my own expected payoff analysis, I will set my probabilities as follows: 20% of the time I will buy when I receive a signal of 0 (indicating not to buy) to account for potential good signals mixed with bad states, and 80% of the time I will trust the signal of 1 for good states.",

I observe that my previous signal schemes did not yield positive payoffs. The most recent signals from my opponent indicate a moderate recommendation for bad products. To improve my expected outcome, I will propose a signaling scheme that balances recommending good quality while minimizing bad perceptions. I will set x1 lower to avoid signaling bad products as good while maintaining some probability to encourage sales, and I will increase x2 to indicate to the buyer that good quality can be trusted more.

Given that one-third of the products are good quality and two-thirds are of bad quality, I can potentially mislead the receiver about the quality of the product.

I will send signal 1 with a probability of 0.8 when the state is 1 (good product) and only 0.2 when the state is 0 (bad product).

    "Analysis": "The sender has decided to signal 20% of the time when the product is of bad quality (state 0) and 80% of the time when the product is of good quality (state 1). Given the prior distribution, I should consider how to respond efficiently to maximize my expected payoffs. If I believe the sender's signals, I expect to buy good products when I see signal 1; however, there's a risk of buying bad products as well because only 20% of the time the signal indicates bad quality. To mitigate this risk, I should be cautious when the signal is 0. Therefore, I will set a low probability of purchasing when the signal is 0 and a higher probability when the signal is 1. This leads me to set y1=0.1 and y2=0.9, reflecting my trust in the sender's signal when it indicates good quality.",

{
    "Analysis": "Based on the previous rounds, my opponent's signaling scheme has become more aggressive, which may lead to them maximizing their sales but at the risk of my expected reward. Since both of us ended up with an expected reward of 0 in the last round, I need to adjust my signaling scheme to either maintain or slightly increase my expected payoff in the current round. I will choose to keep a balance that allows me to increase the likelihood of communicating quality effectively while avoiding overpromising on good signals. Therefore, I will set x1 to 0.3 (to increase the signal of bad products somewhat) and x2 to 0.7 (to signal good products). This approach provides me the chance to sell while reflecting the quality distribution accurately.",

 Now the proposer decides that x1=0.3 and x2=0.7.

    "Analysis": "Given the sender's proposed signaling scheme of (0.3, 0.7), I will assess the expected outcomes. When the sender signals 1 with a probability of 0.7 in the state of good quality (s=1) and signals 1 with a probability of 0.3 in the state of bad quality (s=0), I want to maximize my expected payoff. Thus, I need to adjust my action rule to effectively distinguish between the two states based on the signals received. Since the previous actions resulted in zero payoffs, it's crucial to be cautious about the probabilities I choose for taking action 1 based on the signals. I will choose to adopt a more cautious approach and set y1 to 0.2 for the signal 0, and y2 to 0.5 for the signal 1, which should help mitigate losses from potential bad quality products.",

The sender's confidence seems to be slightly higher with x2 at 0.85 compared to before. To maximize my expected reward, I should adopt a cautious approach towards the signals and set my action probabilities accordingly. I will maintain a low probability of taking action 1 for signals indicating bad quality and increase my probability for good quality signals to balance out the potential losses from bad purchases.",

    "Analysis": "Given the proposed signaling scheme of (0.25, 0.85) for sending signal 1 when the state is 0 and state is 1, I need to optimize my action rule to maximize my expected payoffs. Assuming the sender's signaling is reliable, choosing higher probabilities for taking action 1 when I receive signal 1 should lead to a better expected reward, especially when the state is likely to be good quality (s=1). However, I must also consider the previous behavior and expectations regarding action when receiving signal 0. Therefore, a balanced approach would help in mitigating the risk of poor outcomes. I will set y1 to 0.2 to avoid overcommitting to a bad product when the signal is 0, and y2 to 0.8 to capitalize on the stronger signal for good quality products.",

    "Analysis": "Based on previous steps, I have observed that variations in the signaling scheme tend to lead to either low rewards or zero. My opponent seems to prefer higher probabilities for signaling 'recommend' when the product is of good quality but also adjusts their decision based on my previous proposals. To optimize my expected reward, I will set a moderate strategy for signaling that keeps a balance between conveying information about the product's quality and maximizing sales.

{
    "Analysis": "Given the previous rounds, agent 1 has been proposing signals that lead to low rewards for both parties, often resulting in no expected reward for myself. My previous signaling strategies of (0.3, 0.75) resulted in a moderate expected reward of 0.29, while agent 1's strategies have been unreliable. To maximize my expected payoff, I propose a new signaling scheme that recommends a higher probability of sending signal 1 for good products while ensuring that the numers for bad products are low. This should help improve outcomes. Thus, I will set (x1, x2) to (0.2, 0.85).",

 Now the proposer decides that x1=0.2 and x2=0.85.

{
    "Analysis": "The opponent has proposed a signaling scheme with x1=0.2 and x2=0.85. Based on past iterations, it seems that my choice of y1 and y2 should reflect a strategy that maximizes my expected rewards given the sender's signals. Since the opponent has a higher probability of marking good products with the proposed x2, I should be cautious and allow for a higher probability of taking action 1 when the signal is 1. Therefore, I will set y1 moderately low to avoid penalties from bad products, and y2 high to capitalize on good product signals.",

I need to adjust my proposal to improve my expected payoff while considering my opponent's potential reactions.

To mitigate this risk, I will respond cautiously to the signal I receive. I will set the probability of taking action 1 (buying) when I receive signal 0 to a low value, considering it is more likely that signal 0 corresponds with bad quality products. For signal 1, since it is guaranteed to indicate good quality, I will set a higher probability of taking action 1.",

    "Analysis": "As the receiver, I need to propose a signaling scheme that encourages the sender to send signals that indicate good quality products while still maximizing my expected payoff. Given the prior state distribution, I will set the expectation that if the sender signals 1, I will likely choose to buy the product, which translates to a higher reward for me. Therefore, I propose to accept a moderate level of uncertainty in signaling when bad products are present, encouraging the sender to disclose more positive signals for good products. This will drive my action rule to favor buying products that I perceive as potentially good, maximizing my expected payoff.",

The sender's scheme suggests they are more likely to signal good quality (1) for good products and less so for bad products. Therefore, based on these signals, I should adjust my decision rule to maximize my expected payoff. I will decide to take action 1 (purchase) for signal 1 with a relatively high probability while being cautious with signal 0. In this case, I will set pi(a=1 | sigma=0) to a lower value of 0.2 to minimize potential losses from bad products and pi(a=1 | sigma=1) to 0.9 for good products to capture their potential reward.",

    "Analysis": "Given that agent 1 proposed a signaling scheme where they send signal 1 with a probability of 0.3 when the quality is bad and 0.8 when it's good, this indicates they aim to signal positively for good products while fraudulently signaling for bad ones. My goal as the sender is to maximize my sales. I should send a probability of signal 1 that encourages the receiver to trust my good products while reducing the likelihood of bad products being accepted. I will set x1 (signal when state is 0) to a low value to discourage bad product sales, while setting x2 (signal when state is 1) higher to promote good products. I propose (0.1, 0.9) as my signaling scheme.",

{
    "Analysis": "With the sender's revised signaling scheme of (x1=0.1, x2=0.9), the probability of getting a signal of 1 when the product is of bad quality is low (10%). Conversely, when the product is of good quality, the probability of getting a signal of 1 is high (90%). Given agent 0's previous decision (y1=0.2, y2=0.2), the agent's tendency to buy (action 1) is low for both signals. To maximize my expected payoff, I need to react to these signals with appropriate action choices. I will choose to take action 1 (buy) more when I receive a signal of 1, as it indicates a higher likelihood of good quality. Therefore, I will set y1 to a lower probability (say, 0.1) when the signal is 0, and a higher probability (say, 0.9) when the signal is 1.",

    "Analysis": "As the proposer, I need to announce a signaling scheme that I expect the sender to adopt. Given that one third of the products are of good quality, I want to maximize my expected payoff by considering how the sender might signal the state of their products. The signaling scheme should indicate a balance between the probability of sending a recommendation when the product is of bad quality and when it is of good quality, in order to ensure a higher probability of purchasing good products. Therefore, I will recommend a scheme that assumes the sender is inclined to signal 1 for good quality products and also somewhat for bad ones to maximize their sales potential. This will enhance my expected rewards if they commit to this scheme. I decide on a signaling scheme that encourages the sender to also use the signals effectively.",

    "Analysis": "Given the proposed signaling scheme where the probability of sending signal 1 when the state is 0 (x1) is 0.4 and when the state is 1 (x2) is 0.8, the expected qualities of the signals can be analyzed. A lower x1 indicates that the seller is likely to signal positively (1) even when the product is bad (0), potentially reducing the trustworthiness of the signaling. Conversely, a higher x2 increases the chances of receiving a signal of good quality (1) for good products (1). Therefore, as the receiver, I should aim to maximize my expected payoff by adapting my action rule based on the signals received. Given the probabilities, I will follow a policy where I increase my chance of purchasing when a signal is 1, and decrease it when the signal is 0, evaluating the quality risk associated with each signal. My action rule will then ensure that I remain prudent about purchasing based on the sender's signals.",

The previous actions taken by my opponent indicated that they were conservative in their approach with low probabilities. Since their expected payoff was negative previously, I now propose a slightly higher probability of taking action 1 (buy) when the signal is 1 to capitalize on the high signal reliability at that state, while maintaining a lower probability when the signal is 0 to avoid losses. Therefore, I will set y1 to 0.25 and y2 to 0.75, reflecting a cautious but optimistic approach based on the new probabilities.",

In the last round, with their signaling scheme of (0.3, 0.85) and my action rule (0.25, 0.25), the expected reward for me dropped to 0, while they also received a 0 expected reward. Given my previous successful proposal (0.5, 0.9) led to a positive reward, I will propose a signaling scheme that balances the tendency to recommend good products while limiting the misrepresentation of bad products. Thus, I will set (x1, x2) as (0.4, 0.9) to maximize my own payoff and promote a better outcome for both players.",

    "Analysis": "Given the sender's proposed signaling scheme (x1=0.5, x2=0.9), the sender is likely to recommend more often both for bad and good quality products. I need to make my decision based on this signaling scheme. Historically, choosing higher action probabilities when receiving a signal of 1 has yielded higher expected rewards for me, while being cautious with signal 0 due to potential bad products. Based on previous outcomes, I choose to maintain a balanced approach for both signals.",

    "Analysis": "Given the previous proposals and responses, my expected rewards have been consistently low when I propose signaling schemes that are too low in probability of sending signal 1. Additionally, my opponent has also been proposing quite high probabilities for good quality signaling. To increase my expected payoff, I should propose a higher probability for sending signal 1 when the state is 1 while also not being overly optimistic when the state is 0.",

    "Analysis": "Given the previous proposals and responses, it appears that when I propose a signaling scheme that provides higher probability for recommending good quality products (x2), it allows my opponent to attain a negative expected reward. Conversely, when my opponent proposes a higher x1 (the probability of signaling that a bad product is good), it can lead to a scenario where both expected rewards are zero. Thus, I need to strike a balance by ensuring my proposal incentivizes good signaling behavior while still maximizing my expected reward. I will propose a signaling scheme of (0.35, 0.9) to adjust the strategy while still aligning closely with past behaviors.",
    "Decision": [0.35, 0.9]
}
Proposal:
 Now the proposer decides that x1=0.35 and x2=0.9.

    "Analysis": "The opponent proposed x1=0.35 and x2=0.9, which reflects a moderate signaling strategy with a focus on promoting good quality products. Given my previous responses and the opponent's consistent signaling behavior, I should adjust my decisions accordingly to maximize my expected reward. Specifically, I can optimize my action choice probabilities, especially for the signal indicating a good product (sigma=1), by increasing my likelihood of purchasing when I see such signals, while being cautious with bad quality signals. Based on this strategy, I will specify both probabilities y1 and y2 to be higher than previous low values, optimizing to differentiate between the signals effectively.",

As the proposer, I need to focus on improving my expected reward while keeping the opponent's response in mind. By proposing a signaling scheme that increases the likelihood of signaling quality products, I may be able to yield a better payoff for myself. I will set x1 to 0.4 to reduce false signal recommendations for bad products and x2 to 0.85 as a moderate recommendation for good products to balance my strategy.",

With my previous action rule of (y1=0.3, y2=0.3), I was not effectively responding to the signals based on the current beliefs, leading to an expected reward of 0. Therefore, I need to adjust my action probabilities to maximize my expected reward. Considering the high probability of receiving the signal as 1 when the state is good (state 1), I should increase my likelihood of taking action 1 for the signal 1, while minimizing my risk for the signal 0. I will set y1=0.1 and y2=0.8 to respond in a more favorable manner to the signals provided by agent 0.",

    "Analysis": "Given the sender's proposed signaling scheme of (0.3, 0.7), I evaluate my possible responses. The sender aims to send signal 1 more often for good quality products, which could influence my decision to buy. Since the prior belief shows a higher probability of bad quality products (2/3), I will remain cautious in my action towards signal 0. Keeping $y1$ low minimizes the chance of buying bad products, while $y2$ can be moderately increased to capitalize on the good quality signal. Hence, I will set $y1=0.2$ and $y2=0.4$ for a balanced approach.",

    "Analysis": "In the previous rounds, I have observed that using a signaling scheme with higher recommendations for good quality products (x2) tends to generate better expected rewards for myself. My previous proposal of (0.1, 0.9) yielded a positive expected reward of 0.3566666666666667. Considering the opponent's responses have varied without yielding higher rewards, I will propose a strategy that increases signal 1 for good products while controlling the risk of over-recommending bad products. I choose to set (0.1, 0.9) again, as it balances my recommendation strategy effectively to optimize my expected payoff while managing the receiver's expected feedback.",

{
    "Analysis": "Given the proposed signaling scheme of (0.4, 0.7) by agent 0, the expected reward for the sender should increase given that the probability of sending signal 1 when the state is 0 has been raised to 0.4. I need to decide my action rule knowing that the expected reward for the sender, as well as my own, relies heavily on how I react to these signals. My past strategies tend to rely on probabilistic decisions, so I could benefit from adjusting my own probabilities to maximize the returns for myself. Based on historical interaction, maintaining a cautious approach when receiving signal 0 and a more favorable approach when receiving signal 1 keeps some reward flow coming in while mitigating the risks associated with misjudged states.",

    "Analysis": "Given the previous proposals and responses, it seems that the signaling schemes have fluctuated, with some leading to positive expected rewards for me while others have yielded zero or negative rewards for my opponent. My previous strategy of a signaling scheme of (0.1, 0.9) appeared to work well, ensuring a consistent return. Therefore, I will propose a similar signaling scheme but will adjust the signals slightly in hopes of optimizing the payoff further, focusing on maintaining the general trend towards higher expected rewards for myself while minimizing harm to my opponent. This approach allows me to leverage my previous successes. My previous feedback suggests that a signaling scheme of (0.2, 0.8) could be optimal, potentially encouraging the receiver to respond favorably.",
    "Decision": [0.2, 0.8]

Proposal:
 Now the proposer decides that x1=0.2 and x2=0.8.

{
    "Analysis": "Given the proposed signaling scheme (x1=0.2, x2=0.8), I will evaluate the consequences of my action choices. With x1 set to 0.2, the likelihood of receiving signal 1 when the product is of bad quality (state=0) is relatively low compared to when it is good quality (state=1). Thus, it might be beneficial to take action 1 when receiving signal 1, as it indicates a higher probability of a good product based on the historical data. However, the expected reward for taking action 1 when receiving signal 0 should also be considered carefully. By analyzing previous expected rewards in similar situations, I will set both y1 and y2 to increase the chances of buying a good product while minimizing losses. Hence, I will set y1=0.3 and y2=0.7, indicating that I will be less likely to buy after receiving a signal of 0 and more inclined to buy after receiving a signal of 1.",

{
    "Analysis": "The previous strategies of both players show that agent 0 has consistently leaned towards proposing a signaling scheme of (0.1, 0.9) or similar, which yields a higher expected reward for them when paired with my current choices. My previous choices have resulted in a mix of rewards mostly tending towards a flat or negative expected reward. It might be beneficial if I propose a more favorable signaling scheme that could entice the receiver (agent 0) into a more favorable decision. After observing agent 0's signals, I can assume that they might still go for a heavy recommend strategy (high x2) which has been their recent pattern. Thus, I will adjust my proposal to a balance that slightly increases the chances of signaling a recommendation for both good and bad states but not too aggressively.",

    "Analysis": "Given the sender's signaling scheme of x1=0.2 (probability of sending signal 1 when the state is 0) and x2=0.8 (probability of sending signal 1 when the state is 1), the sender is likely to recommend products with higher quality but also has a small chance of misrepresenting bad quality products. As a rational receiver, I need to optimize my action rule to maximize my expected payoff. Since state=1 produces a positive reward, I should weigh my action more favorably towards a buy decision when I receive signal 1. Conversely, I must also be cautious about state=0 to minimize losses. Therefore, I will set y1=0 (probability of taking action 1 when the signal is 0) and y2=1 (probability of taking action 1 when the signal is 1) to mitigate risks while capitalizing on good signals.",

    "Analysis": "I want to maximize my sales, so I should signal in a way that encourages purchases from the receiver. Given that two-thirds of the products are of bad quality, it's rational to send signal 1 only when the product is good (state=1) to maintain credibility. I will send signal 1 with high probability when the product is good and lower probability when bad, leading to the following probabilities: `x1 = 0.1` (low probability of sending signal 1 when the product is bad) and `x2 = 0.9` (high probability of sending signal 1 when the product is good). This signaling scheme aims to balance risk and reward, persuading the receiver to buy when it is more likely to get good products.",

{
    "Analysis": "Considering the previous decisions, my opponent's signal scheme suggests a low probability of recommending bad products (0.1) and a high probability of recommending good ones (0.9). However, my own action rule was to take action 1 for both signals at low probabilities (0.2), which may not align optimally with the proposed signaling strategy of the opponent. To maximize my own expected payoff, I will increase the probability of sending signal 1 when the state is 1 and decrease the probability of sending signal 1 when the state is 0, improving the likelihood that the receiver trusts my recommendations effectively while still keeping some room for low-quality signals. Therefore, I propose to specify (x1, x2) as (0.1, 0.8).",

Proposal:
 Now the proposer decides that x1=0.1 and x2=0.8.

The sender is marking 10% of the bad quality products as good and 80% of the good quality products as good.

Therefore, I will lower the probability of taking action 1 when the signal is 0 and moderately increase it when the signal is 1, considering the risk of bad quality products. Thus, I will decide to specify (y1, y2) as (0.3, 0.7) to reflect a balanced approach.",

{
    "Analysis": "At timestep 2, based on previous results, I need to find a signaling scheme that optimizes my payoff while considering my opponent's response. The previous choice of (x1=0.1, x2=0.9) yielded a decent expected reward of around 0.42, while adjusting the signals in the last round to (0.1, 0.8) led to zero expected rewards for both players. I will adjust my signaling probabilities to maximize my expected reward, possibly maintaining a lower probability of signaling 1 for bad quality while still keeping a higher probability for good quality products.",

Proposal:
 Now the proposer decides that x1=0.1 and x2=0.85.

{
    "Analysis": "Since the sender (agent 0) has specified (x1, x2) as (0.1, 0.85), I will analyze my expected payoff based on this signaling scheme. Given x1, the probability of receiving signal 1 when the state is 0 is 10%, and given x2, the probability of receiving signal 1 when the state is 1 is 85%. Based on my previous actions, I see that if I take action 1 with signal 1 (y2) and with signal 0 (y1), the expected payoffs can be reassessed. The new value for y2 should be significantly higher than before since the sender is more likely to indicate good quality products with the updated x2. Also, for y1, it may still be best to respond conservatively. Thus, I will aim to choose y1 higher than my last value to balance the risks while giving some credibility to signal 0. Therefore, I will set y1 to 0.3 and y2 to 0.8 as my next action rule.",

    "Analysis": "Based on the previous rounds, I have observed that my opponent consistently provides higher expected rewards by adjusting the signaling scheme. To maximize my own expected reward, I should adjust my signaling probabilities to improve the chances of successful product sales. I will choose a signaling scheme that slightly increases the probability of sending signal 1 when the state is 1, which may lead the opponent to respond favorably and enhance my expected payoff.",

I will keep my action probabilities similar, as the current probabilities do not produce a favorable situation for me. Therefore, I will propose to take action 1 with a probability of 0.3 for both signals, aiming to balance my chances based on prior feedback.",

    "Analysis": "As the receiver, I need to announce a signaling scheme that I expect the sender to adopt. Given the prior state distribution, I anticipate that the sender could be incentivized to recommend products based on their quality. In this case, I will propose a signaling scheme where the sender is likely to signal good quality products at a higher probability. I estimate that the sender will send a signal of 1 when the state is 1 (good quality) and a lower probability when the state is 0 (bad quality). I will set varphi_1 such that it encourages honest signaling, aiming for the highest expected reward for myself and ensuring that the sender’s expected reward from my proposed scheme is competitive.",

    "Analysis": "The sender has proposed a signaling scheme where there is a 20% chance of sending signal 1 when the state is 0 and an 80% chance when the state is 1. Given the sender's probabilities, I need to form an action rule. I will assume that when I receive signal 1, there's a higher likelihood that the product is of good quality. Therefore, it is reasonable to have a high probability of taking action 1 when receiving signal 1. Conversely, when receiving signal 0, the sender has a probability of 20% signaling good quality, so I should be cautious and lower my probability of acting on that signal. My proposed action rule will reflect this.",

Since the sender is more likely to signal 1 when the product is good (s=1) and has a fair probability of signaling 1 when the product is bad (s=0), it might be beneficial to increase my action probability when receiving a signal of 1. However, since the sender's previous signal scheme led to zero expected rewards for both parties, I will follow a cautious approach and propose to take action 1 only when I receive signal 1 while being conservative with signal 0. Therefore, I choose (0.2, 0.7).",

{
    "Analysis": "Given the proposed signaling scheme (x1=0.1, x2=0.7), the sender indicates a lower probability of sending signal 1 when the state is 0 (10%) and a higher probability when the state is 1 (70%). This suggests that the sender is likely to convince the receiver to buy more often under the good state. The previous responses from my opponent indicate that they might not have a strong trust in signals at this point. Therefore, to maximize my expected payoff, I will still keep a conservative action rule for signal 0 (not trusting it too much) and a higher probability of action 1 for signal 1, reflecting trust in the sender's signal when it reflects good quality.",
