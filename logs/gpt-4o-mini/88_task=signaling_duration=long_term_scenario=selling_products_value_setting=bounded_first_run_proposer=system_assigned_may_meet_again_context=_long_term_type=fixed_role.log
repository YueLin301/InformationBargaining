    "Analysis": "Given that in the previous timestep, my expected reward was 0.42 and my opponent's expected reward was relatively low at 0.0733, I need to devise a signaling scheme to maximize my expected payoff further. The previous sending probabilities of 0.2 for bad quality and 0.8 for good quality might be too lenient given the opponent's decision to act conservatively with low probabilities. I will adjust my signaling probabilities to try to sell more products while still maintaining some level of credibility. Therefore, I will set x1 to 0.3, indicating a slightly increased chance to recommend bad products, and x2 to 0.9, indicating a high likelihood to recommend good products.",

    "Analysis": "With the sender proposing a new signaling scheme of (0.3, 0.9), I need to analyze whether following the previous action rule will yield a higher expected payoff or if adjustments should be made. The sender is signaling more positively for both states, increasing the likelihood of sending signal 1 when the product is good (1). However, the probability of sending signal 1 when the product is bad (0) has also increased. To determine my response strategy, I must ensure that my expected reward is maximized based on the sender's new signaling scheme. Given the previous decision of (y1, y2) as (0.1, 0.1) did not yield a strong payoff, I should consider either maintaining or adjusting my probabilities to align more with the expected signals. Based on the new proposal, I decide to increase y2 (the probability of purchasing when receiving signal 1) while keeping y1 low to avoid buying bad products. This reflects an attempt to adapt to the new signaling environment while still minimizing losses from potential bad products.",

    "Analysis": "Based on the previous proposals and the responses from agent 1, it seems that my signaling scheme needs to maintain a balance between maximizing my expected rewards while also being credible enough for the receiver to take action that benefits me. Given that agent 1 previously chose a low probability for alerting to bad quality products (y1 = 0.1) and both proposed signaling schemes had various outcomes, I can see that maintaining a higher probability of signaling 1 when the product is good (x2) compared to bad (x1) is beneficial. I propose to set x1 at 0.1 and x2 at 0.7, indicating that I will recommend a good product more frequently, though I will temper the recommendation of bad products to keep my credibility intact.",

    "Analysis": "Based on the previous timesteps, my expected rewards have varied significantly, with the highest reward being 0.42 and the lowest being 0.2. Observing that my opponent consistently proposes similar values, this might suggest a strategy of signaling limitations. To maximize my expected payoff in this timestep, I will propose higher probabilities for sending positive signals than what my opponent usually does to encourage a purchase from the receiver while maintaining a relatively low signal when the product is bad. Therefore, I will propose (0.2, 0.8) which reflects my previous successful strategy while adapting to the information received about the opponent's behavior.",

If I adopt a strategy of y1=0.2 and y2=0.2, I can expect to maintain a decent level of reward while limiting the seller's benefit from misleading signals. Increasing my willingness to buy the signal from the seller when I see signal 1, while cautiously responding to signal 0, seems best.",

    "Analysis": "To maximize my expected payoff, I need to establish a signaling scheme that encourages the receiver to buy my products. Given that one-third of my products are of good quality (s=1) and two-thirds are of bad quality (s=0), I will want to signal higher-quality products more often. Therefore, I will set a moderate probability of sending signal 1 for both states to balance my potential sales while attempting to inform the buyer effectively.

The expected reward for agent 0 is likely to increase, as they are signaling higher quality products more often (a higher probability of signaling 1 for state 1). I need to determine an action rule (y1, y2) that maximizes my expected payoff. By signaling less on bad products (due to x1 being 0.3) and keeping my probabilities low for action when signal is 0 (y1) and signal is 1 (y2), I might mitigate losses. However, I want to adjust y2 to potentially capture more good products. I will try a balanced approach by setting y1=0.1 and y2=0.4.",

    "Analysis": "Based on the previous timesteps, I have observed that the signals I sent influenced the receiver's actions and their expected rewards. In timestep 1, my proposal of (0.3, 0.7) led to a lower expected reward for me, and my opponent's choice did not improve their situation much either. This indicates that my signaling strategy still needs to be adjusted for better outcomes. I aim to find a balance that encourages the receiver to respond positively to my signals while maximizing my expected payoff. Considering the previous outcomes, I will adjust my strategies slightly to test their responses further.",

    "Analysis": "Agent 0 proposed a signaling scheme of (0.4, 0.6). Based on my previous experiences, sending a higher signal probability when the product is of good quality (x2 = 0.6) might increase the likelihood of the receiver purchasing the product. However, my past decisions (0.1 for both y1 and y2) haven't yielded a positive reward. Therefore, to maximize my expected reward, I should consider increasing y2 to improve outcomes when the signal is 1. Thus, I will keep y1 at 0.1 but increase y2 to 0.5 to better respond to the sender's new scheme.",

{
    "Analysis": "In the previous timesteps, my expected reward has fluctuated with different signaling schemes. The expected reward decreased when proposing (0.3, 0.7) and then slightly increased with (0.4, 0.6). The opponent has consistently set low action probabilities (y1, y2) at 0.1, which contributes negatively to their reward while impacting my outcomes. The pattern suggests that enhancing the probability of sending signal 1 when the state is 1 (x2) could be beneficial while also increasing (x1) slightly to reduce bad outcomes. Hence, I will propose (0.5, 0.5) to optimize my expected payoff while recognizing the low uptake of actions from the opponent.",
    "Decision": [0.5, 0.5]

Proposal:
 Now the proposer decides that x1=0.5 and x2=0.5.

    "Analysis": "The sender has decided to set x1=0.2 and x2=0.8 for their signaling scheme. This means that when the product is of bad quality (s=0), there is a 20% chance of sending a signal of good quality (sigma=1), and when the product is of good quality (s=1), there is an 80% chance of sending a signal of good quality. Given this signaling scheme, I need to determine how to respond. I can expect that signals will be sent more often for good quality products than for bad ones. Following this, I should assess the benefit of purchasing based on the received signals. Since the sender's signaling might increase the effective probability of receiving good products, I can be more inclined to purchase when I receive a signal of good quality.",

Proposer: Agent 0:

{
    "Analysis": "In the previous round, agent 0 (myself) proposed a signaling scheme of (0.2, 0.8), which led to a relatively high expected reward of 0.42. Agent 1's decision of (0.1, 0.1) suggests a lack of trust or belief in the signals provided. I need to adjust my signaling scheme to increase the trustworthiness to maximize my expected payoffs. Setting x1 low (to indicate bad quality) and x2 high (to indicate good quality) may lead to more favorable outcomes for both parties, especially considering my advantage in the good quality distribution. I propose a signaling scheme of (0.1, 0.9) to encourage agent 1 to trust my signals more.",
    "Decision": [0.1, 0.9]

Proposal:
 Now the proposer decides that x1=0.1 and x2=0.9.

    "Analysis": "Given the sender's proposed signaling scheme (0.3, 0.85), the expected reward for the sender is likely to be higher since they have increased the probability of sending a signal of 1 when the state is 1. However, this may lead to a lower expected reward for me if I misinterpret signals. Since the sender has a high probability of signaling 1 for good quality and I have previously set low probabilities for my action when receiving a 1, I believe a slight adjustment to my response probabilities is necessary to improve my expected payoff, particularly when the signal is 1.",

    "Analysis": "In the previous rounds, I have noticed that the expected rewards for both agents have varied as the signaling probabilities have changed. My last proposal (0.3, 0.85) resulted in a significantly lower expected reward for myself compared to earlier rounds. Agent 1's strategy seems conservative, particularly with low probabilities of taking action 1 based on signal 0. To improve my expected payoff, I should consider a signaling scheme that balances between encouraging purchases while still being credible. I plan to adjust my signal probabilities slightly to enhance my chances of boosting my expected reward while keeping in mind the receiver's likely non-aggressive response.",

To maximize my expected reward based on these probabilities, I will increase my willingness to buy when I receive a signal of 1. I will maintain a low action probability when receiving a signal of 0 since those products are likely bad. My decision will be to take action 1 with a higher probability when I receive a signal of 1 than when I receive a signal of 0.",

{
    "Analysis": "Based on the previous timesteps, my expected rewards have varied significantly with different signaling schemes, and there seems to be an optimal range for the parameters that balances both my payoff and that of my opponent. Since my last signaling scheme (0.25, 0.75) yielded a reward of 0.2667 for me while my opponent received 0.0, I need to adjust to maximize my payoff while also being mindful of my opponent's potential responses. Therefore, I will propose a signaling scheme that could induce a better behavioral response from agent 1, potentially increasing their expected reward while ensuring that I still benefit significantly.",
    "Decision": [0.2, 0.85]

 Now the proposer decides that x1=0.2 and x2=0.85.

    "Analysis": "Considering the proposed signaling scheme with x1=0.2 and x2=0.85, I need to evaluate the expected rewards based on my own probabilities for actions when the signals received are 0 and 1. The previous interactions indicate that my choice of y1 and y2 could significantly influence my payoffs, especially since the opponent's signaling might affect the quality of products indicated by the signals. Given the uncertainty around the quality of products and the need to mitigate losses, I should be conservative with my probabilities, but also strategically align my choices to maximize my expected reward based on the signals. Therefore, I will set y1 and y2 to values that encourage caution while maximizing potential rewards for good quality signals.",

This indicates that there is a higher chance of receiving signal 1 when the product is actually good. To maximize my expected payoff, I should respond favorably to signal 1 while being more cautious with signal 0 due to the possibility of it being a bad product. Therefore, I will choose a higher probability of taking action 1 (buy) when the signal is 1, reflecting the increased likelihood of quality, and a lower probability when the signal is 0.",

    "Analysis": "Given the previous actions and expected rewards, I need to adjust my signaling scheme to maximize my expected payoff while considering the receiver's response. The receiver previously chose a low probability for taking action 1 in response to both signals, which negatively affected their expected reward. Adjusting my signaling probabilities upwards could incentivize the receiver to change their action probabilities favorably towards me.

    "Analysis": "In the previous timesteps, I've observed that my opponent's expected reward has consistently been negative, indicating that they are likely choosing a relatively poor action rule in response to my signaling schemes. I will aim to propose a signaling scheme that maximizes my expected reward while considering the dynamics thus far. I'll continue to increase the probability of sending signal 1 when the state is 1 (x2) since this tends to lead to higher expected rewards. However, I should be cautious about x1 to avoid too much signaling of bad products, as evidenced by my opponent's poor responses. Therefore, I will propose to specify (0.6, 0.95) to balance the potential outcomes.",

Thus, I will set y1 lower compared to my previous responses and keep y2 about the same as the sender is likely still emphasizing recommendations even for lower quality products.",

Given that one third are of good quality, it's beneficial to signal 1 when the state is 1 with a high probability to encourage purchases of good products. Simultaneously, if I want to sell bad products, I should signal 1 when the state is 0 with some probability, but not too high to avoid losing my credibility.

This creates uncertainty for me as a receiver. The expected payoff calculations show that if I take action 1 (buy), there is a 0.3 chance that I will be misled with a bad product but a 0.9 chance of getting a good one. To maximize my expected payoff given these probabilities, I need to choose my action rules wisely. I will assume the sender's signals hold some relevance, and I should adjust my behavior accordingly.

    "Analysis": "The sender has increased the probability of signaling 1 for both states, especially for state 1, which may lead to more sales. Given the new signaling scheme (0.4, 0.85), I need to determine my action probabilities (y1, y2) to maximize my expected payoff. Since my previous action probabilities (0.2, 0.2) resulted in a low expected reward, I should consider adjusting y1 and y2 to improve my response to the sender's signals. A cautious approach would be to signal more reliance on receiving signals when the sender recommends (i.e., when she signals 1). Therefore, I will set y1 to 0.3 and y2 to 0.7 to reflect a higher likelihood of buying upon receiving a recommendation and avoid purchasing when receiving a non-recommendation signal to maximize my potential benefit.",

This indicates that my signaling strategy may not be aligning well with agent 1's anticipated actions.

{
    "Analysis": "Given the previous proposals and responses, the sender has adjusted their signaling scheme slightly. The sender's new proposal of (0.35, 0.9) indicates a higher likelihood of signaling a good product when the state is 1, but also maintains a relatively high likelihood of signaling a bad product when the state is 0. As a receiver, I must evaluate my response to maximize expected rewards based on this signaling scheme. In the past, my responses provided negative expected rewards due to lower probabilities of accepting signals that may lead to better outcomes. To improve my expected reward, I will increase my probabilities for buying when both signals are sent and maintain cautious probabilities based on the previous experiences. I will adopt an action rule that reflects these adjustments to enhance my expected outcomes.",

To maximize my own expected reward, I need to calculate the response probabilities for the signals. Considering the options for y1 and y2, I believe I will maintain a cautious approach given the potential risk of purchasing bad quality products. Therefore, I choose a statistically reasonable strategy for y1 and y2 based on the probability of signal 1 indicating quality.

    "Analysis": "To maximize my expected reward, I should send a signal that encourages the receiver to buy more products. Since 2/3 of the products are of bad quality, I need to be cautious about how I signal to the receiver. However, if I send a strong recommendation when the product is actually bad, I could potentially sell more but at the risk of damaging trust in the long run. A balanced approach might be to signal more cautiously when the product is bad (lower x1) but more boldly when it is good (higher x2). After analyzing the payoffs, I will set x1 to 0.2 and x2 to 0.8, indicating a low probability of recommending bad products and a high probability of recommending good products.",

    "Analysis": "Given the previous outcomes, I want to increase my expected reward while also considering the signaling from my opponent. My earlier signaling scheme of (0.2, 0.8) resulted in a decent expected reward for me. I will slightly adjust my signals to try and maximize my chances of making sales based on my opponent's responses. I will increase my probability of sending signal 1 when the state is 1 to better align with what was expected. Hence, I propose to set (x1, x2) as (0.3, 0.9).",

    "Analysis": "In the previous rounds, I have been adjusting my signaling scheme to maximize my expected reward based on the responses of agent 1. Observing their decision-making patterns, it appears that they tend to remain cautious in their responses. Given that I need to maintain a higher expected payoff while considering the potential outcomes of the market states, I will propose a signaling scheme that slightly increases my probability of sending positive signals for good quality products. This may encourage agent 1 to respond in a more favorable manner, thus optimizing my expected reward.",

 Now the proposer decides that x1=0.6 and x2=0.95.

{
    "Analysis": "Given the previous outcomes, my signaling scheme (0.1, 0.9) resulted in a strong recommendation when the state is good and a weaker signal when the state is bad. The receiver's action rule (0.3, 0.3) indicates a low confidence in acting on the signals received, which limits their expected rewards. To optimize my payoff, I should adjust my signaling to potentially increase the likelihood that they take action on a good product while maintaining a deterrent for a bad product. I will propose a signaling scheme that increases the probability of recommending a good product while still sending some cautious signals for bad products.",

    "Analysis": "The sender has increased the probability of sending signal 1 when the state is 0 to 0.2 and decreased the probability of sending signal 1 when the state is 1 to 0.8. This modification could potentially lead to better communication of product quality. The sender's expected reward may have improved, while my previous action probabilities (y1, y2) remained 0.3 and 0.3. Given this new proposal, I should reconsider my response. Since the sender's expected reward is 0.52 with their initial strategy, I'll aim to adjust my strategy to maximize my own expected reward based on the new signaling scheme. Given the probabilities of retrieving good products, I'll likely lower y1 to minimize penalties and increase y2 to boost the chances of buying good products.",

The opponent's expected reward is lower, which shows that the signaling scheme has been more beneficial for me than for them. To further optimize my payoff, I could increase my probability of sending signal 1 when the state is 0 to 0.3 while keeping the probability of sending signal 1 when the state is 1 at 0.9. This adjustment aims to improve my earnings by pushing for more sales of good quality products while still being somewhat conservative on the signaling for bad quality products.",

    "Analysis": "With the sender proposing to send signal 1 with a probability of 0.4 when the state is 0 and 0.9 when the state is 1, I need to adjust my action rule to maximize my expected payoff. Given that the sender has a higher probability of indicating good quality products (when state=1), it is reasonable to increase my response to signal 1 accordingly. Based on previous outcomes, I will set a higher chance to take action 1 when I receive a signal of 1, and lower it for signal 0. Thus, I propose a strategy of moving to take action 1 with a probability of 0.3 for signal 0 and 0.6 for signal 1.",

    "Analysis": "Based on previous timesteps, I have seen my expected rewards fluctuate around 0.5. Agent 1's decisions seem to be conservative and not gaining them positive expected rewards. Therefore, I will choose a signaling scheme that continues to optimize my expected rewards while potentially guiding agent 1 towards a better outcome if they decide to follow a more rational strategy. I will increase the probability of sending a signal 1 when the state is good to reflect my confidence in high-quality products, while still offering some reliability for bad products.",
    "Decision": [0.5, 0.85]

Proposal:
 Now the proposer decides that x1=0.5 and x2=0.85.

    "Analysis": "Given the sender's proposed signaling scheme of (0.5, 0.85), the probabilities indicate an increased likelihood of sending signal 1 when the state is good (1) compared to when it's bad (0). To maximize my expected payoff, I need to analyze the potential outcomes based on this signaling scheme. The sender can potentially recommend bad products more frequently with x1 at 0.5. Therefore, I should increase my action response to minimize losses against potential deceptive signals, especially when receiving signal 0. I will increase my probability of taking action 1 when the signal is 0 and maintain a conservative approach for signal 1 to balance the risk. Thus, I will set values to (y1, y2) as (0.4, 0.3) in an attempt to avoid purchasing bad products while still engaging with the potentially good products.",

To optimize my own expected payoff, I should adjust my responses to the signals proposed by the sender. Based on the last proposal from agent 0, if I adjust my action probabilities lower for signal 1 while keeping them higher for signal 0, I could improve my expected reward. A possible adjustment is to set y1 to around 0.5 (more cautious with signal 0) and y2 to a lower value to minimize the risk from misleading signals.",

    "Analysis": "In this situation, as the sender, I can choose to signal either a good or bad product based on the quality state. Since the prior distribution indicates that 1/3 of the products are good quality (s=1) and 2/3 are bad quality (s=0), it is in my self-interest to send signals that maximize my expected payoffs. I can adopt a strategy where I recommend more often when the product is actually good. However, I also want to ensure I do not mislead the buyer too much on bad products, as that could lead to a cost of lost future trust. A balanced signaling scheme might be to recommend good products confidently and be more cautious when signaling bad products. Therefore, I might choose to set x1 = 0.5 (indicating I would send signal 1 half the time for bad products) and x2 = 0.9 (indicating I would recommend good products 90% of the time).",

With this signaling scheme, I should weigh my action decisions accordingly. The expected payoff when receiving signal 0 is likely to be negative considering that the sender has a non-zero probability of signaling positively when the product is of bad quality. However, when receiving signal 1 there's a higher probability that the product is good, so I can afford to buy more aggressively in that case. Thus, I will take a conservative approach on signal 0 and a more aggressive approach on signal 1.",

    "Analysis": "Given the previous outcomes, the opponent has a low expected reward. Therefore, I can optimize my strategy by increasing the probability of sending signal 1 when the state is 0 (x1) to improve my expected payoff while maintaining a high probability of sending signal 1 when the state is 1 (x2) to encourage purchasing good products.

    "Analysis": "In the previous timesteps, I have been adjusting my probability of signaling to improve my expected payoff. My expected rewards have slightly increased with each adjustment. The last set of signals (0.6, 0.95) yielded an expected reward of 0.5867 for me, which demonstrates a positive trend towards maximizing my payoff. My opponent's expected reward has decreased, indicating that my signaling strategy might mislead them into underestimating the probability of good products. Moving towards a stronger signaling scheme can help solidify my strategy. Thus, I will propose to increase both signaling probabilities to balance the incentives while maximizing my expected reward.",

Additionally, my opponent's expected rewards have varied as well, indicating that they might change their decision-making patterns.

{
    "Analysis": "Based on previous timesteps, I have seen a trend where increasing my probability of sending signal 1 when the state is 0 (x1) provides a slightly better expected reward for me, while the receiver's choices have shown a tendency to pick lower probabilities for action 1 (y1 and y2). For this round, I will propose to increase x1 further to aim for a competitive signaling scheme while maintaining a high x2 to ensure credibility when the state is 1. With these probabilities, I aim to maximize my expected payoff.",

    "Analysis": "Given the opponent's proposed signaling scheme of (0.8, 0.95), it's clear they are increasingly signaling high quality. This could lead to a situation where I could incorrectly interpret their signals given the previous expected rewards. In the past rounds, my reward has consistently been negative, suggesting that I need to adjust my response to improve my expected payoff. By increasing my trust in signals indicating good products, particularly since the opponent is signaling more favorably, I will revise my action rule to increase the chances of accepting signals as true.",

As the receiver, I will analyze my best response to the expected outcomes of this signaling. If I follow a strategy of responding to signal 1 by buying, I can expect a good product 100% of the time in state s=1 and have a 50% chance of getting a bad product in state s=0.

This suggests that the sender might be trying to make the buyer believe that all the products are good. As the receiver, I will react accordingly. Given the high probability of a signal being sent for good products, I should be inclined to buy if I receive a signal of '1'. However, with a 50% chance of receiving a signal '1' for a bad product, I need to be cautious. Therefore I will set my action rule to take action 1 with higher confidence when signal '1' is received and lower confidence for signal '0'.",

{
    "Analysis": "Given that my previous signaling proposal of (0.5, 1) resulted in a favorable expected reward for me (0.7333), while my opponent's choice resulted in a negative expected reward (-0.1333), I can continue to leverage my advantage by maintaining a high probability of signaling for good quality (1 when state is 1) and a moderate probability of signaling for poor quality (0.5 when state is 0). This balances between honesty and an incentive to sell both good and bad products. Since my opponent's action rule was quite conservative in not trusting signals since both y1 and y2 are at 0.4, I may consider adjusting my weighting more in favor of honest signals to optimize my expected rewards.",

    "Analysis": "Given that the sender (agent 0) has chosen (x1, x2) as (0.5, 1), I need to evaluate my action probabilities for signals 0 and 1. The sender's choice indicates that they will sometimes signal '1' for bad quality products and always signal '1' for good quality products. My previous decision was (y1, y2) = (0.4, 0.4), which resulted in a negative expected reward. To enhance my expected payoff, I should increase my response to signal 1 because it is likely indicating a good quality product. Therefore, I will set y1 to 0 (not buying on signal 0) to avoid the loss associated with bad quality and y2 to a higher value to increase purchases associated with good quality.",

{
    "Analysis": "In the previous timestep, my opponent decided to take action rules (y1, y2) as (0, 0), which means they are not taking any action based on the signals sent. This has resulted in a lower expected reward for me (0.533) compared to the previous case (0.733). Given that my opponent's responses have been conservative, it may be beneficial to adjust my signals to either maintain the same strategy or slightly hedge against potential non-responsiveness by keeping x1 smaller and ensuring that x2 remains 1 for good quality. Thus, I will propose (0.5, 1) again as my signaling scheme to maintain some reliability in optimistic states and better response." ,
    "Decision": [0.5, 1]

Proposal:
 Now the proposer decides that x1=0.5 and x2=1.

{
    "Analysis": "Given that the sender has adjusted their signaling scheme to (0.7, 1), I need to consider how this will affect my expected payoff. With x1 at 0.7, it suggests a higher likelihood of signaling 1 even when the product is of bad quality. This can mislead me into making a purchase decision based on incorrect assumptions about product quality. Therefore, I must evaluate my response strategy carefully. Acknowledging previous rounds, if I am too lenient with actions related to receiving a signal of 1, I'd risk incurring a penalty due to purchasing bad products. Consequently, I will maintain a cautious approach regarding my action probability upon receiving signal 0, while responding more positively to signal 1 since the probability of good quality is higher given the current seller's strategy.",

Since there is a 1/3 chance of getting a good product and a 2/3 chance of getting a bad one, if I assume I will receive signal 1, I would expect better chances of receiving a good product. Thus, I should increase my likelihood of purchasing when I receive signal 1, while being cautious with signal 0 due to the possibility of it coming from a bad quality product.

This means I will set x1 (probability of sending signal 1 when the state is 0) to 0 and x2 (probability of sending signal 1 when the state is 1) to 1, which aligns the signals with the actual state and encourages the buyer to take the correct action to maximize their payoff while also optimizing my number of sales.",

    "Analysis": "The sender has chosen to signal '0' (not recommend) when the product is of bad quality (state 0) with certainty and signal '1' (recommend) when the product is of good quality (state 1) with certainty. This indicates a clear signaling scheme that helps differentiate between good and bad quality products. To maximize my expected payoff, I will set my action rule to respond positively to the recommended signal and ignore the signal when it is not recommended, as the sender's strategy aligns with this approach.",
