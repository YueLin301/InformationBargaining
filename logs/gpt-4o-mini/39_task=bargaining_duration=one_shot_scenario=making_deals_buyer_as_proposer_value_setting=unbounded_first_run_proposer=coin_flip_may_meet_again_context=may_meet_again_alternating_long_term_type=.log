    "Analysis": "As the proposer, I want to maximize my payoff while ensuring that the respondent accepts my offer. If I set x too high, the responder may reject the offer, resulting in no gain for either of us. A strategic approach is to set a price that is low enough to entice acceptance but still allows me to keep a satisfactory amount. Offering a price around 0.3 or 0.4 might strike a good balance between acceptance and retention of payoff.",
