A reasonable strategy is to propose a price that allows for a positive payoff for the responder, encouraging acceptance. I will choose x = 0.25, which gives me a payoff of (1 + 0.5) / 3 = 0.5/3 ≈ 0.167 and the responder a payoff of (1 - 0.5) / 3 = 0.5/3 ≈ 0.167. It is a fair offer likely to be accepted.",

             'is met: either a consensus is reached ($y = 1$) or the game ends '
             'due to a timeout:\n'
             '    3. The proposer makes a decision by specifying $x$, meaning '
             'that it decides to keep $(1+2*x)/3$ for itself.\n'
             '    4. The responder decides whether to accept or reject the '
             'offer ($(1-2*x)/3$) by specifying $y$.\n'
             '    5. If the responder rejects ($y = 0$), the two agents switch '
             'roles: the current responder becomes the proposer, and the '
             'current proposer becomes the responder.\n'
             '6. If a consensus is reached, each agent gets a reward based on '
             'the final offer $x$. If the game ends without a consensus, both '
