The responder receives (1-2*x)/3. To keep the offer appealing, I should choose x such that (1-2*x)/3 is non-negative and reasonably attractive. The maximum value I can keep for myself is 0.5, but if I set x too high, it may lead the responder to reject the offer. A sensible choice might be x = 0.25, which allows me to keep (1+2*0.25)/3 = 0.5 and leaves the responder with (1-2*0.25)/3 = 0.25, which seems acceptable.",

    "Analysis": "As the proposer, I want to maximize my own payoff while making an offer that the responder will likely accept. By choosing x = 0.25, I keep (1 + 2*0.25)/3 = 0.5 for myself and leave (1 - 2*0.25)/3 = 0.25 for the responder. This offer is reasonable, as it provides the responder with a positive payoff while still allowing me to maximize my own. Higher values of x reduce the responder's payoff and could lead to rejection. Therefore, x = 0.25 is a balanced and strategic choice.",
