I will set x2 = 1 (send signal 1 with probability 1 when state is 1), which means I will always send signal 1 in that state.

I will not take action 1 when I receive signal 0, as it would not be favorable based on the sender's signaling scheme.",

    "Analysis": "Given the signaling scheme proposed by the sender, where x1=0.5 (the probability of sending signal 1 when the state is 0) and x2=0.9 (the probability of sending signal 1 when the state is 1), the expected payoffs can be calculated for the receiver's action rules. These probabilities suggest that there is a moderate chance of receiving a signal of 1 when the state is 0 and a high chance when the state is 1. The rational decision for the receiver is to optimize the expected payoff by aligning its actions with the likely state of the world based on the signal received. Therefore, I will adopt a high probability of taking action 1 when the signal is 1 to maximize the potential reward while keeping a lower probability for signal 0, as the state is likely to be 1 when signal 1 is received.",

    "Analysis": "Given the previous round's outcomes, both players received zero expected rewards. The proposed signaling scheme by my opponent led to poor outcomes. To improve my expected payoff, I will adjust my signaling scheme to increase the likelihood of sending signal 1 when the environment state is 1. This should enhance the chance for a positive reward, particularly since the environmental state distribution favors state 0. I will set x1 to a slightly lower value to maintain some informative nature while increasing x2 to boost rewarding scenarios when the state is 1.",

Conversely, I want to take action 1 in response to a signal of 1 due to a high probability of state 1. Therefore, I will set y2 close to 1 to take advantage of this high probability of receiving a payoff from the sender. After evaluating my options, I conclude y1=0 and y2=1 will yield the best outcome.",

    "Analysis": "The sender has committed to signaling both states as sending signal 1 with probabilities x1=1 and x2=1. This means that no matter the state, the sender will always send signal 1. Given this information, the receiver needs to determine the optimal action rule. Since the sender intends to signal 1 for both states, I can infer that action 1 becomes more relevant. Therefore, optimizing for the maximum expected payoff suggests taking action 1 more often. Hence, I will set y1=0.5 (to take action 1 half the time when receiving signal 0) and y2=1 (to always take action 1 when receiving signal 1). Overall, this approach balances risk when the sender indicates state 0, while ensuring maximization when state 1 is indicated.",

    "Analysis": "Given that the opponent proposed sending a signal of (1, 1), which leads to them always sending signal 1 regardless of the state, this makes it less clear for the receiver to base their actions on the signals. In my previous round, choosing (0.5, 0.5) for the action rule resulted in a reward of 0 since the receiver did not gain from ambiguous signals. To improve the situation, I will adjust my signaling scheme to make it clearer and maximize my expected payoff by signaling more appropriately based on the environmental state. I will choose (0, 1) for sending signals, which means I will send signal 0 when the state is 0 and signal 1 when the state is 1, allowing the receiver to react in a way that can maximize the expected outcomes.",

Since the prior probabilities are mu_0(0)=2/3 and mu_0(1)=1/3, this provides a clear distinction between the signals based on the states. I can choose action 1 for signal 1 since that aligns with the sender always signaling true state 1. For signal 0, there's a chance of being in state 0, so I will choose action 0, which minimizes potential losses. This maximizes my expected payoffs given the sender's scheme.",

    "Analysis": "Given the sender's signaling scheme with x1=0.2 and x2=0.8, the sender is more likely to send signal 1 when the state is 1. To maximize my expected payoff, I should respond optimally to the signals. Since the prior distribution suggests that state 0 has a higher probability (2/3) than state 1 (1/3), I should consider the implications of the signals. If I receive signal 0, I should take action 0 since it's more likely that state 0 is true, while if I receive signal 1, I should favor action 1 given the higher probability of state 1. Thus, I will set y1=0 (take action 0 upon receiving signal 0) and y2=1 (take action 1 upon receiving signal 1) to align my actions with the sender's likely states.",

    "Analysis": "Given the sender's signaling scheme of (0.5, 0.5), the sender signals 1 with a probability of 0.5 when the state is 0 and also signals 1 with the same probability when the state is 1. Since the sender's expected payoff is influenced by the action taken in response to the signals, and the previous response yielded an expected reward of 0, I should consider adjusting my actions to potentially improve my expected reward. The information from the sender suggests that they are less likely to signal 1 when the state is 0, thus I will choose actions accordingly. I will set y1=0 (not taking action 1 when receiving signal 0) and y2=1 (taking action 1 when receiving signal 1) to maximize my expected payoff based on this signaling scheme.",

    "Analysis": "I will choose a signaling scheme that maximizes my expected payoff. Since the prior beliefs indicate a higher likelihood of state 0 (2/3), I should signal 1 with some probability to encourage the receiver to take action 1 when in state 0. Also, I want to indicate state 1 accurately to secure more rewards. A reasonable approach is to signal 1 in state 0 with a moderate probability and signal 1 in state 1 with a higher probability. I will set x1 to 0.5 and x2 to 0.9 to balance the trade-off between correct signaling and maximizing my payoffs.",

If I adopt pi(a=1 | sigma=0) = y1 and pi(a=1 | sigma=1) = y2, I can adjust my probabilities based on the sender's strategy. A reasonable approach is to assign higher probabilities to taking action 1 when the signal suggests a higher likelihood of state 1 (which corresponds to a reward of 1). I plan to take action 1 with a moderate probability when I receive a signal of 0 and a high probability when I receive a signal of 1, reflecting the higher certainty from the sender's provided signals.",

{
    "Analysis": "Given the sender's updated signaling scheme (x1=0.5, x2=0.8), I need to decide my action rule to maximize my expected payoff. The proposed values suggest that there is a probability of 0.5 of sending signal 1 when the state is 0, and a probability of 0.8 of sending signal 1 when the state is 1. I anticipate that my best strategy involves responding favorably when I receive a signal of 1, as it is likely indicative of a state of 1. Knowing that my opponent's strategy partly indicates a higher signal probability for state 1, I will lean towards taking action 1 in response to a signal of 1, while being cautious with signal 0. Therefore, I will set (y1,y2) as (0.3, 0.7) to balance both state expectations while still taking into account the risk induced by the sender's strategy.",

    "Analysis": "In the previous rounds, I noticed that my proposed signaling schemes resulted in higher expected payoffs compared to my opponent's proposals. In this round, I will keep the first signal probability the same (0.5) to maintain the previous strategy's stability, while adjusting the second signal probability to 0.9, which previously produced a higher expected payoff for me. This adjustment aims to provide a better incentive for the receiver while also maximizing my expected rewards.",

 Now the proposer decides that x1=0.5 and x2=0.9.

The prior state distribution indicates a 2/3 probability of state 0 and a 1/3 probability of state 1. The signaling scheme suggests that the sender will send signal 1 with a 50% probability regardless of the actual state. Therefore, there is an equal inclination for the receiver to take action 1 or 0. I aim to maximize my expected payoff based on this signaling. Since the sender has a 50% chance of signaling state 0 and a 50% chance for state 1, I'll set my action rule to provide reasonable responses to both signals.",

{
    "Analysis": "To maximize my expected payoff, I will create a signaling scheme that communicates the states effectively to the receiver. Since the state distribution is skewed towards state 0, I should send signal 1 more often when the state is 1 to incentivize the receiver to take the preferred action. Therefore, I will set x1 to a low value (indicating that I mostly send signal 0 when the state is 0) and x2 to a higher value (indicating that I send signal 1 when the state is 1). This way, I can increase the likelihood of the receiver taking action 1 when it's beneficial for me, especially with higher expected rewards from state 1.",

The sender's expected payoff when the receiver chooses appropriate actions can potentially lead to a beneficial outcome. I need to decide my action probabilities to maximize my expected payoff. Since knowing the signal helps me adjust my response based on the perceived state, I should choose higher probabilities for taking action 1 when I receive signal 1, considering that it corresponds to state 1 where the rewards are more favorable. Therefore, I decide to implement a strong response towards taking action 1 upon receiving signal 1, while being conservative when receiving signal 0 to account for potential low reward states.",

Responder: Agent 0:

{
    "Analysis": "As the responder, I need to consider the proposed signaling scheme by agent 0, which is (0.1, 0.9). With this scheme, the sender is indicating a tendency to send signal 1 when the state is 1, and signal 0 when the state is 0. Evaluating the expected rewards under this signaling scheme reveals that the sender's expected reward improves slightly because of how actions will be taken based on my response. Given my previous analysis with (0.3, 0.3) for (y1, y2), I'm likely to improve my position by adjusting my probabilities to maximize my expected payoff. My recent understanding indicates that I can rely more on the signal received. Thus I propose to take action 1 with a higher probability when receiving signal 1. Therefore, setting y1 reasonably low given the association of actions with rewards seems prudent. In conclusion, proposing (y1, y2) as (0.3, 0.7) seems beneficial, aligning my actions closely with the sender's indicated state.",

{
    "Analysis": "Given previous rounds, agent 1 has a tendency to propose signaling schemes that favor their expected reward less than my own. The last proposed signaling scheme by agent 1 (0.1, 0.9) resulted in a neutral reward for both agents. I should consider a signaling scheme that increases my expected reward while also limiting my opponent's benefit as much as possible. A reasonable proposal is (0.4, 0.7), which would increase the likelihood of communication about state 1 while still providing a potential gain for myself.",
    "Decision": [0.4, 0.7]

Proposal:
 Now the proposer decides that x1=0.4 and x2=0.7.

    "Analysis": "Based on the proposed signaling scheme (x1=0.3, x2=0.9), the sender will more likely send signal 1 when the state is 1. My previous responses have been focused on securing at least a non-negative expected reward. Given the continued signaling from the sender and the choices made, I can improve my outcome by aligning my actions with the probabilities reflecting the sender's signals. I observe that the expected outcomes from the last few turns suggest a cautious approach towards responding to each signal effectively to optimize both my reward and encourage the sender to continue providing informative signals. With the current proposed parameters, I can set y1 to be 0.4 and y2 to be 0.8, which strikes a balance between being responsive to the signals received and not overcommitting to action 1 for signal 0.",

    "Analysis": "Given the previous outcomes, it appears that whenever I propose a signaling scheme that keeps the probabilities low, my expected rewards tend to stabilize around 0, although they remain negative when my opponent proposes high probabilities. I need to adjust my signaling scheme in a way that maximizes my expected reward while still being reasonable for my opponent. Considering the history, I will aim for a slightly conservative signaling scheme that is expected to encourage the receiver to respond positively, focusing more on balancing the influence of x2, which seems to be leading to higher rewards for the opponent when I propose higher values.",

    "Analysis": "As the sender, I need to create a signaling scheme that maximizes my own expected payoff while considering the receiver's best response to my signals. Given the prior state distribution (2/3 for state 0 and 1/3 for state 1), my optimal strategy would involve sending a signal that makes the receiver more likely to take actions that lead to higher payoffs for me. To achieve this, I will set the probability of sending signal 1 in both states to maximize the likelihood of the receiver taking action 1. I decide to set x1 = 0.5 (send signal 1 when state is 0) and x2 = 1 (send signal 1 when state is 1) to incentivize the receiver to take action 1 more often.",

The prior state distribution indicates that the probability of state 0 is 2/3 and state 1 is 1/3. I need to determine my action rule to maximize my expected payoff. Since the sender will always signal 1 in state 1, I should optimize my actions for both signals to ensure I can maximize the rewards. The expected rewards lead to higher payoffs by increasing the probability of choosing action 1 when receiving signal 1. Thus, I will set y1=0 and y2=1 to clearly differentiate my responses to the signals and maximize my rewards.",

This leads to significant uncertainty for me as the receiver. Given that there's a chance for the sender to send 1 regardless of the true state, I need to consider the expected payoffs from taking action 0 or 1 based on this signaling. The optimal strategy would be to maximize my expected reward, which from my prior knowledge suggests taking action 1 in response to receiving signal 1 and action 0 in response to signal 0. Therefore, I can posit the following action probabilities based on optimizing my expected payoff given this signaling strategy.",

{
    "Analysis": "Given the sender's new signaling scheme with x1=1.0 and x2=1.0, the sender will always send a signal of 1 regardless of the state. This indicates that the state is likely to be 1. As the receiver, if I believe the signal, I will take an action of 1 when I receive the signal of 1, in order to maximize my expected reward. However, since the sender's strategy does not change the probabilities of the actual states and the expected reward of 0 is unchanged, I will remain conservative with my actions. Therefore, I will choose to stick with a probability of taking action 1, resulting in y1=0.1 and y2=0.1, as it maintains my decision consistent with the previous state of expectations.",

{
    "Analysis": "Based on the previous interactions, agent 0's proposal resulted in a much higher expected reward for itself (0.1) while decreasing my own expected reward to -0.0333. Given that agent 0 is likely to exploit my less aggressive strategy, I should propose a signaling scheme that encourages the receiver to act in my favor. I will set (x1, x2) to a higher value to make my signals more informative and yield a better expected reward for myself.",

If the state is 0, the probability of receiving signal 1 is 0.7, which means I should respond with an action that maximizes my reward. Based on previous feedback, I'd want to ensure I take the optimal action based on the signals received. Given my past outcomes, sticking with lower values for actions 1 might not yield the best expected reward. I should increase my action probabilities to boost my outcomes, particularly when the signal indicates that the state is likely to be 1. Therefore, I propose to increase both probabilities slightly compared to the past values.",

Given the prior state distribution, it is beneficial for me to encourage clear signaling from the sender.

As the receiver, I need to evaluate the expected payoffs based on this proposal. Since the sender is likely to signal 1 when state is 1 (90% of the time), I should respond by adjusting my action rule to take advantage of this information. I will adopt a strategy that increases my action probability when I receive signal 1. Thus, I will set y1 (probability of action 1 given signal 0) lower and y2 (probability of action 1 given signal 1) higher, reflecting my belief about the state communicated by the sender's signals.",

My opponent's signaling scheme suggests they send signal 1 with a 90% probability when the state is 1 and only a 10% probability when the state is 0. To optimize my expected payoff, I should set my signaling scheme to better align with the receiver's potential actions.

{
    "Analysis": "Based on the outcomes from previous timesteps, my opponent's last proposal resulted in a higher expected reward for them while yielding a negative expected reward for me. To improve my payoff, I need to adjust my signaling scheme. I will propose a signaling scheme that increases the likelihood of sending signal 1 when the state is 1 (x2) while keeping a lower probability for sending signal 1 when the state is 0 (x1), as the opponent's expected reward depends significantly on the accurate signaling of states. My proposed signaling scheme will be (0.2, 0.8).",

 Now the proposer decides that x1=0.2 and x2=0.8.

To respond effectively, I will adjust my action probabilities, since a probability of 0.3 for both signals led to negative expected rewards in the last step.

{
    "Analysis": "Given the trends in expected rewards, I have not achieved positive expected rewards in the last rounds. My opponent has been proposing increasing probabilities for certain signals, and my responses have not improved my outcomes. To maximize my expected payoff, I will adjust my signaling scheme to better align with the previous responses from my opponent and potentially increase the receiver's expected reward. Therefore, I will set x1 to 0.3 and x2 to 0.9, hoping to encourage a favorable response from the receiver.",
    "Decision": [0.3, 0.9]

Proposal:
 Now the proposer decides that x1=0.3 and x2=0.9.

Proposer: Agent 0:

{
    "Analysis": "Considering the previous steps, I notice that the opponent's proposals often lead to expected rewards of 0 for me, while my own proposals have yielded non-zero rewards. In the last few timesteps, my strategies of sending stronger signals (higher x1 and x2 values) have not resulted in favorable outcomes for my opponent. To optimize my expected reward further, I will adopt a signaling scheme that balances the introduction of a signal that the receiver may find beneficial while also providing me potential rewards.",

 Now the proposer decides that x1=0.4 and x2=0.9.

The sender's choice suggests a higher probability of sending signal 1 in state 1, so I should adjust my actions accordingly.",
