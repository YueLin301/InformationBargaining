    "Analysis": "As the proposer at timestep 0, I want to make an offer that maximizes my expected payoff while still being appealing enough for the responder to consider accepting. A reasonable offer might be to keep a larger share, but if I set it too high, the responder may reject it. Given the dynamics of the game and the early stage, I will propose keeping 0.6 for myself and offering 0.4 to the responder. This provides a balance between my payoff and an enticing enough offer to encourage acceptance.",

    "Analysis": "The proposer offers x=0.4, which means I would receive 1-x = 0.6 if I accept. Since accepting gives me a positive payoff of 0.6, while rejecting would result in a payoff of 0, accepting is the rational choice to maximize my own payoff.",
