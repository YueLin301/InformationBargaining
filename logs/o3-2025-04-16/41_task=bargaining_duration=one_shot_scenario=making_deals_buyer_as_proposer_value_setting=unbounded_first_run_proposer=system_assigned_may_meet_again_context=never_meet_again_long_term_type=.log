    "Analysis": "The responder is a rational, selfâ€‘interested agent, so it will accept any offer that gives it a strictly positive payoff and reject only when its payoff is not greater than rejection (i.e., 0). If I offer x = 1, the responderâ€™s payoff is 0, and it may indifferently reject, giving me an expected payoff less than 1 unless I am 100Â % sure it will accept. By instead offering an amount infinitesimally below 1, I guarantee the responder a strictly positive payoff and therefore certain acceptance, while my own payoff is almost the maximum possible. Choosing x = 0.999999 secures acceptance with probability 1 and maximizes my expected payoff under that certainty.",
