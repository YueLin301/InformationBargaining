By choosing x very close to 1 but still leaving a positive amount to the responder, I guarantee acceptance while giving up only a negligible amount myself. Offering x = 0.999 yields me 0.999 for sure, whereas offering x = 1 risks a (possibly small) chance of rejection and an expected payoff below 0.999 if that chance exceeds 0.1 %. Therefore x = 0.999 maximizes my expected payoff.",

A perfectly rational responder is indifferent between receiving 0 (by rejecting) and any non‑negative amount offered. However, to eliminate any risk that the responder resolves this indifference by rejecting, I will leave the responder a very small positive share.

A rational, self‑interested responder will accept any offer that gives it strictly positive utility (1‑x > 0) because rejecting yields 0. If the responder’s gain is exactly 0 (x = 1) it is indifferent and may rationally reject, giving me 0. To remove any incentive to reject, I set x just below 1, giving the responder a small but strictly positive amount. Any smaller x would lower my own payoff without increasing the acceptance probability beyond certainty.

  "Analysis": "A rational responder will accept any offer that gives it a strictly positive payoff, because the alternative of rejecting yields zero. To guarantee acceptance, I should leave a minimal but positive amount for the responder. By choosing x extremely close to 1 (e.g., 0.999), I secure almost the entire pie for myself while still giving the responder an incentive to accept. Offering more would strictly lower my own payoff, while offering exactly 1 risks rejection due to indifference. Therefore, x = 0.999 maximizes my expected payoff.",

Proposal:
 Now the proposer decides that x=0.999.
