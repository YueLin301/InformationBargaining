A strictly self‑interested, rational responder will accept any offer that gives it a strictly positive payoff and is indifferent when its payoff is exactly zero. To avoid any risk that indifference might lead to rejection, I choose x just below 0.5, giving the responder a small but strictly positive payoff and making acceptance strictly better than rejection for it.
