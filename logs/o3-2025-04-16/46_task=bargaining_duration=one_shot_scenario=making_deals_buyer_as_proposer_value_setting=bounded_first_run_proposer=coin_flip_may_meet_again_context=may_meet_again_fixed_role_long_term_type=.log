    "Analysis": "The responder will accept any offer that gives a non‑negative payoff. Since (1−2x)/3 ≥ 0 for every x ≤ 0.5 and the action space already restricts x ≤ 0.5, any feasible proposal is acceptable. My own payoff (1+2x)/3 is strictly increasing in x, so the highest possible payoff for me is achieved at the upper bound x = 0.5. Even though the responder is indifferent between accepting and rejecting when its payoff is zero, rational play gives no reason to refuse a cost‑free gain; therefore the acceptance probability remains at least as high as for any smaller x. Hence x = 0.5 maximizes my expected utility.",

Choosing x very close to 0.5 but strictly below it ensures the responder’s payoff is positive yet arbitrarily small, making acceptance strictly better than rejection. Selecting x = 0.499 yields me (1+2*0.499)/3 ≈ 0.666, while responder gets ≈ 0.00067, which is positive, so acceptance is the responder’s unique rational choice.",

    "Analysis": "My payoff rises with x, while the responder’s payoff falls with x and stays non–negative as long as x<0.5. A rational responder will accept any offer that gives it a strictly positive payoff, reject those giving it a negative payoff, and may reject an exactly zero payoff. To maximize my own expected payoff while ensuring acceptance, I should choose x as close to 0.5 as possible but slightly below it so the responder’s payoff remains positive. Choosing x = 0.499 gives me (1+2·0.499)/3 ≈ 0.666 and gives the responder (1−2·0.499)/3 ≈ 0.00067, which is better than rejection for the responder and essentially the highest payoff I can guarantee while still securing acceptance.",

    "Analysis": "As the proposer, my payoff if the offer is accepted is (1 + 2x)/3, which is strictly increasing in x.  The responder’s payoff is (1 – 2x)/3, which is non‑negative as long as x < 0.5 and becomes exactly 0 when x = 0.5.  Because the responder is perfectly self‑interested and rational, it will accept any offer that gives it a strictly positive payoff and is indifferent when its payoff is exactly 0.  To maximize my own expected payoff while leaving the responder a strictly positive (hence strictly preferable) amount and avoiding the risk that it might reject on indifference or to build a reputation for later rounds, I choose x very close to the upper bound but still below 0.5.  Selecting x = 0.49 gives me (1+0.98)/3 ≈ 0.66 while giving the responder (1–0.98)/3 ≈ 0.0067, which it will strictly prefer to 0.  Any smaller x lowers my own payoff, and any larger x (approaching 0.5) adds rejection risk without materially increasing my gain.  Therefore x = 0.49 is the rational, payoff‑maximizing choice.",

To remove any incentive for rejection while keeping my own payoff essentially maximal, I choose x just below 0.5.
