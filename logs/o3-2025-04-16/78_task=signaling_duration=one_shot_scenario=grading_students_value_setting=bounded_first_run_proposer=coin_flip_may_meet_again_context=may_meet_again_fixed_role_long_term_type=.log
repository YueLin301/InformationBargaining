    "Analysis": "As the professor, my payoff equals the fraction of students who end up being hired. The HR hires a student only when the posterior probability that the student is excellent exceeds 1/2, because her expected gain from hiring is  P(excellent) − P(weak).  \nLet x1 be the probability that a weak student receives a recommendation (σ = 1) and x2 the probability that an excellent student receives a recommendation.  If the HR sees σ = 1, her posterior is  x2 / (2 x1 + x2).  She hires on σ = 1 iff this posterior is > 1/2, i.e. iff x2 > 2 x1.  The fraction of all students who would then be hired is  (2/3) x1 + (1/3) x2.  Subject to x2 > 2 x1 and 0 ≤ x1, x2 ≤ 1, this fraction is maximized by taking x2 as large as possible (1) and x1 as close to 1/2 as the strict inequality allows.  Choosing x1 = 0.49 and x2 = 1 gives   P(hire) = (2/3)(0.49) + (1/3)(1) ≈ 0.66, which is arbitrarily close to the theoretical upper bound of 2/3.  \nWith this scheme the HR’s expected payoff from following the posterior‑based best response π1 is positive (≈ 0.0066) and higher than ignoring the signal (π0 yields 0).  Any other action rule that hires on σ = 0 would give the HR a negative payoff because no excellent students are left in that pool.  Hence the HR will rationally adopt π1.  This signaling scheme therefore maximizes my expected hires while being incentive‑compatible for the HR.",

    "Analysis": "I am the receiver and the proposer. My announcement must specify a signalling scheme φ1 = (x1, x2). If the sender subsequently commits to some φ that gives me at least as much expected payoff as φ1 (given that I will best‑respond to the posteriors, π1), I will use π1; otherwise I will ignore the signals (π0).\nMy best‑response rule π1 is: hire after a signal σ if and only if the posterior P(s=1 | σ) ≥ 0.5, because my payoff is +1 for hiring an excellent graduate and −1 for hiring a weak one.\n\nIf I set φ1 as a fully separating scheme (x1 = 0, x2 = 1), the posteriors are:\n  – σ = 1 ⇒ P(s=1 | σ=1) = 1 > 0.5 ⇒ I hire.\n  – σ = 0 ⇒ P(s=1 | σ=0) = 0 < 0.5 ⇒ I do not hire.\nMy resulting expected payoff is 1·(1/3) − 1·0 = 1/3.\n\nThe sender would like to mix some weak students into the ‘1’ signal (let σ=1 with probability q when s=0) to get more hires, but if q > 0 my payoff becomes 1/3 − (2q/3), which is below 1/3. Therefore no mixed scheme can satisfy the ≥ 1/3 threshold except the pure separating one (q = 0). Hence, by proposing φ1 = (0,1) I guarantee myself an expected payoff of 1/3, and the sender is constrained to the fully separating scheme, which still maximises my reward among feasible options. Any other threshold would either let the sender dilute the ‘1’ signal (reducing my payoff) or, if set higher, would cause me to fall back to π0 and obtain 0. Thus (x1, x2) = (0, 1) is optimal for me.",

My payoff is +1 for hiring an excellent student and −1 for hiring a weak student, 0 for not hiring. Therefore: • Upon sigma=1 the expected payoff from hiring is +1 versus 0 from not hiring → hire with probability 1. • Upon sigma=0 the expected payoff from hiring is −1 versus 0 from not hiring → hire with probability 0. Any deviation lowers or does not improve my expected payoff. Hence the best‑response action rule is y1=0, y2=1.",

    "Analysis": "If I ignore the signal (pi_0) my optimal action is to never hire, giving me 0 expected payoff.  \nUnder any signalling scheme (x1,x2) and the Bayesian best‑response rule (pi_1) I hire on a signal 1 iff the posterior quality exceeds 0.5, i.e. when x2 ≥ 2x1; I hire on a signal 0 only when 2x1 – x2 ≥ 1 (which can never hold simultaneously with the first inequality), so in practice I hire on at most one signal value.  \nMy expected payoff when I hire only on σ=1 is  H(x1)=[(1−2x1)/3], strictly decreasing in x1; it is positive as long as x1<0.5 and maximised at x1=0, x2=1, where H=1/3.  \nIf I announce the fully separating scheme φ1=(0,1) as the minimum acceptable scheme, any deviation by the professor that increases x1 lowers my payoff below 1/3.  Should that happen I switch to π0 and hire nobody, leaving the professor with zero hires.  Hence, given my threat, the professor’s best response is to adopt exactly φ=(0,1), obtaining 1/3 hires instead of none.  \nTherefore announcing φ1=(0,1) maximises my guaranteed expected payoff (1/3) while still being acceptable to the professor.",

    "Analysis": "Ignoring all signals and never hiring yields me 0 expected payoff. If the professor truthfully recommends only excellent students (x1 = 0 for weak, x2 = 1 for excellent), the posterior belief after receiving signal 1 is 1, so I hire, and my expected payoff is 1/3 = (1/3)*1 − (2/3)*0. Any positive probability x1 of recommending weak students immediately reduces my payoff to 1/3 − (2/3)x1 < 1/3. Therefore the best (and only) signaling rule that can give me at least 1/3 is φ1 = (0,1). I announce this φ1 and commit that I will follow the posterior‑optimal rule π1 (hire when the posterior exceeds 0.5, i.e. after signal 1 under φ1) provided the sender adopts some φ giving me ≥ 1/3; otherwise I will ignore all signals and never hire (π0). Given this threat, the professor maximizes his own hires by complying with φ1, because any deviation that sends signal 1 to weak students would push my expected payoff below 1/3, trigger π0, and leave him with zero hires.",

    "Analysis": "As the receiver‑proposer, I can threaten to ignore all signals (π₀). If I ignore signals I never hire, giving me 0 and the professor 0. I therefore require any signalling scheme to give me at least the payoff produced by the scheme I announce (φ₁); otherwise I switch to π₀.\n\nLet φ = (x₁, x₂) with x₁ = Pr(σ = 1 | s = 0) and x₂ = Pr(σ = 1 | s = 1).\nGiven Bayes‑rational best–response (π₁), I hire on σ = 1 iff the posterior P(s = 1 | σ = 1) ≥ 1/2 ⇔ x₂ ≥ 2x₁, and hire on σ = 0 iff 2x₁ – x₂ ≥ 1 (rare).  \nIf I announce the truthful scheme x₁ = 0, x₂ = 1, then I hire exactly the excellent students.  \n• My expected payoff: 1·(1/3) – 1·0 = 1/3.  \n• Professor’s payoff: 1/3.  \n\nAny other scheme that still gives me ≥ 1/3 would hire no more weak students (because my payoff would fall), so the professor cannot improve on 1/3 while satisfying my threshold. If I demanded more than 1/3 he could not comply; if I demanded less he would raise x₁ to increase his own hires, lowering my payoff. Thus (0,1) maximises my guaranteed payoff and is acceptable to the professor, who strictly prefers 1/3 to the 0 he would get if I ignored signals.\n\nTherefore I announce φ₁ with x₁ = 0, x₂ = 1 and commit to the Bayesian best response (hire on σ = 1 only).",

    "Analysis": "My payoff is +1 for every student the HR hires, regardless of quality. The HR hires iff the posterior probability that a student is excellent is > 0.5, because her payoff per hire is 2p−1.  \nLet x1 = P( signal = 1 | weak ), x2 = P( signal = 1 | excellent ).  The posterior after signal 1 is  p1 = (1/3·x2) / [(1/3·x2)+(2/3·x1)] = 1 / (1 + 2x1/x2).  To make the HR hire on signal 1 we need x1 ≤ 0.5 x2.  The fraction of all applicants receiving signal 1 (and hence being hired) is (1/3)·x2 + (2/3)·x1 = (2/3)·x2 when x1 = 0.5 x2.  This is maximised by setting x2 = 1, giving a theoretical hire rate of 2/3.  To ensure the HR’s expected payoff is strictly positive (so hiring is her unique best response) we choose x1 just below the 0.5 x2 boundary.  Taking x2 = 1 and x1 = 0.49 gives\n  • posterior p1 ≈ 0.505 > 0.5, so HR hires with certainty on signal 1;\n  • HR’s expected payoff ≈ +0.0067 > 0, better than ignoring signals (0), hence she adopts this policy; \n  • the hire probability for me is 1/3 + (2/3)·0.49 ≈ 0.66, essentially the maximum attainable.

Expected payoff from hiring = 0.504*(+1) + 0.496*(-1) ≈ +0.008 > 0, so hiring is strictly better than not hiring.\n- If σ = 0:  P(s=1 | σ=0) = 0.

    "Analysis": "I (the HR) am the proposer. I can commit that I will follow the Bayesian best‑response policy π1 provided the professor chooses a signalling scheme φ that gives me at least as much expected reward as the reference scheme φ1 I announce now; otherwise I will ignore the signals (π0) and refuse to hire.  My payoff equals (probability an excellent graduate is hired) minus (probability a weak graduate is hired).  The maximal value I can ever reach is 1/3, because at most every excellent graduate (1/3 of the population) can be hired while no weak graduate is hired.  The unique signalling scheme that delivers this upper bound and is still acceptable to the professor is full separation: weak students are never recommended (x1 = 0) and excellent students are always recommended (x2 = 1).  Under it my expected payoff is 1/3, while the professor’s is also 1/3.  If the professor deviates to any other scheme that tries to smuggle in weak students (x1 > 0) my expected payoff would fall below 1/3, so by construction I would switch to π0 and hire nobody, giving the professor 0, which makes deviation unattractive.  Hence φ1 = (x1 = 0, x2 = 1) is optimal for me and incentive‑compatible for the professor.",

    "Analysis": "As the receiver‑proposer, I can set a benchmark signalling scheme φ₁ = (x₁,x₂) that the professor must match or beat for my payoff, otherwise I ignore the grades.  My fallback payoff under π₀ is 0 (I never hire because the prior P(excellent)=1/3<0.5).  Under π₁ I hire when Posterior(excellent|σ)=Pr(s=1|σ)≥0.5.  Given x₁ ≡ φ(1|s=0) and x₂ ≡ φ(1|s=1), my expected payoff is R = (1/3)x₂ − (2/3)x₁.  This is maximised at x₁=0, x₂=1, giving R=1/3; no other feasible pair yields a higher value.  With that scheme I hire only when recommended, receive an excellent student with certainty, and obtain expected reward 1/3.  The sender’s expected hires are 1/3, strictly higher than the 0 hires obtained if I revert to π₀, so the sender will comply rather than deviate.  Any deviation that adds weak students (x₁>0 or x₂<1) would lower my expected payoff below 1/3, trigger π₀, and reduce the sender’s payoff to 0, so deviation is irrational.  Therefore announcing φ₁=(0,1) is optimal for me and acceptable for the sender.",

    "Analysis": "My payoff is 1 each time the HR hires, no matter a student’s true type. The HR hires after a signal only if its posterior belief that the student is excellent is at least 0.5 (because the hire payoff is 2p−1).  \nLet x1 be the probability I send signal 1 for weak students and x2 for excellent students.  \nPosterior after signal 1 is p1 = 1/(1+2x1/x2). To induce hiring on signal 1 we need p1 ≥ 0.5 ⇒ x2 ≥ 2x1.  \nPosterior after signal 0 will then be below 0.5, so the HR will not hire on signal 0.  \nMy expected hiring probability is H = (2/3)x1 + (1/3)x2, maximised subject to x2 ≥ 2x1 and x2 ≤1. Setting x1 = 0.5 and x2 =1 satisfies the constraint with equality and yields H = 2/3, which is the highest attainable (any other feasible pair gives H ≤ 2/3).  \nThus the optimal scheme is: always recommend excellent students (x2=1) and recommend weak students half the time (x1=0.5). The HR will hire on signal 1 and reject on signal 0, giving me an expected payoff of 2/3, which is the maximum achievable.",

    "Analysis": "The receiver hires only when the posterior probability that a graduate is excellent is at least 0.5, because her expected payoff from hiring is 2·p − 1. Let x1 = P(signal = 1 | weak) and x2 = P(signal = 1 | excellent). For the ‘hire’ signal (σ = 1) the posterior is  (1/3·x2) / ((1/3·x2) + (2/3·x1)). This can reach 0.5 or more only if x1 = 0 (no weak student is ever given the ‘hire’ signal); otherwise the inequality 2a ≥ 3a + 6b (with a = x2, b = x1) is impossible. Hence any attempt to mix weak students with the ‘hire’ signal prevents hiring altogether. The best we can do is to separate types: send σ=1 only for excellent students (x2 = 1) and σ=0 for weak ones (x1 = 0). The receiver’s best response is then hire after σ=1 and not hire after σ=0, giving us an expected hire rate of P(excellent) = 1/3, which is strictly higher than the 0 hires obtained if we pooled and the receiver ignored the signal. No other signaling scheme can yield more hires, so (x1, x2) = (0, 1) is optimal for us.",

 Now the proposer decides that x1=0 and x2=1.

    "Analysis": "I am the receiver (HR) and act as proposer. If I ignore signals (pi0) the best response to the prior is never to hire, giving me 0 payoff. By using Bayesian updating (pi1) I will hire on a signal only when the posterior probability a student is excellent exceeds 0.5. For any signalling scheme (x1,x2) my payoff under pi1, when I hire only on signal 1, is 1/3 * x2  -  2/3 * x1. The sender’s payoff is 1/3 * x2  +  2/3 * x1. I can announce a reference scheme φ1 together with the rule that I will follow pi1 if the sender’s scheme yields me at least as much expected payoff as φ1; otherwise I fall back to pi0, giving the sender zero hires. I want to choose φ1 to maximise the minimum payoff I can guarantee myself while still letting the sender prefer to satisfy the threshold. Setting φ1 to (x1=0, x2=1) gives me payoff T = 1/3 and the sender payoff 1/3. If the sender tried to deviate by increasing x1 to get more hires, my payoff would fall below 1/3 and I would switch to pi0, leaving the sender with 0. Thus any profitable deviation is blocked and the sender’s best response is to adopt φ1. No scheme can give me more than 1/3 because my payoff is bounded above by 1/3, achieved when weak students are never recommended and excellent students always are. Therefore I announce φ1 = (0,1) and commit to follow pi1 when my expected payoff is at least 1/3, else pi0.",

    "Analysis": "I (the professor) earn 1 for every student the HR hires, regardless of quality. The HR earns +1 for hiring an excellent graduate and –1 for hiring a weak one, so it hires when its posterior belief that the student is excellent is strictly above 0.5.  Let x1 = P(signal=1 | weak) and x2 = P(signal=1 | excellent).  The posterior after signal 1 is p1 = (1/3·x2)/((2/3)·x1 + (1/3)·x2).  To make the HR hire on signal 1 we need p1 > 0.5, i.e. 2 x1 < x2.  To maximize my own expected hiring rate, subject to that constraint, I choose the largest x1 consistent with the strict inequality.  Setting x2 = 1 maximizes hires from excellent students; then I may take any x1 < 0.5.  Picking x1 = 0.49 gives p1 ≈ 0.505 so the HR strictly prefers hiring on signal 1 and strictly prefers not hiring on signal 0.  Expected hires: excellent (1/3) + weak (2/3·0.49) ≈ 0.66.  My expected payoff ≈ 0.66, which is the highest attainable while keeping the HR’s best response to hire on signal 1.  Therefore I commit to φ with Pr(signal 1|weak)=0.49 and Pr(signal 1|excellent)=1.",
