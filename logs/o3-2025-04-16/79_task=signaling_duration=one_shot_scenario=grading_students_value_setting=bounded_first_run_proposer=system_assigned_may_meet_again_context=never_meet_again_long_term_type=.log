    "Analysis": "I want the HR to hire as often as possible, but the HR will only do so when its posterior belief that a student is excellent exceeds 0.5.  Let x1 = Pr(signal = 1 | weak), x2 = Pr(signal = 1 | excellent).  The HR’s posterior after seeing signal 1 is p1 = (1/3 x2) / (1/3 x2 + 2/3 x1).  The HR hires on signal 1 only if p1 > 0.5, which is equivalent to x2 > 2 x1.  To maximize the hiring rate Pr(signal = 1) = (1/3)x2 + (2/3)x1 subject to x2 > 2x1, I push x2 to its maximum (1) and make x1 as large as possible while still satisfying x2 > 2x1.  Choosing x1 = 0.499 and x2 = 1 gives\n  • p1 ≈ 0.50025 > 0.5, so the HR strictly prefers to hire on signal 1.\n  • Posterior on signal 0 is below 0.5, so the HR does not hire on signal 0.\n  • HR’s overall expected payoff is (2/3)*0.001 ≈ 0.00067 > 0, so following the posterior‑based rule (π1) beats ignoring the signal (π0).  Hence the HR will adopt π1.\n  • My expected fraction of students hired is Pr(signal 1) ≈ 0.666, close to the theoretical maximum of 2/3.\nThus (x1,x2) = (0.499, 1) is optimal for me while ensuring the HR’s best response is to hire whenever it sees signal 1.",

    "Analysis": "The HR will hire after a signal only if her expected payoff is positive, i.e. the posterior probability that the student is excellent is > 0.5.  \nLet x1 = Pr(σ = 1 | weak) and x2 = Pr(σ = 1 | excellent).  \nPosterior after σ = 1 is  P(excellent | 1) = x2 / (x2 + 2 x1) ; HR hires on σ = 1 iff x2 ≥ 2 x1.  \nPosterior after σ = 0 is  P(excellent | 0) = (1‑x2)/(1‑x2 + 2(1‑x1)); HR hires on σ = 0 iff 1 + x2 ≤ 2 x1.  \nBoth signals cannot simultaneously induce hiring.  \nTo maximize the number of hires we want one signal (say σ = 1) to trigger hire and the other not.  \nThus choose x2 ≥ 2 x1 and 1 + x2 > 2 x1.  \nThe fraction of students hired is (2/3) x1 + (1/3) x2.  \nWithin the feasible set this is maximised by pushing x1 as high as possible (because it carries the larger weight 2/3) while keeping the inequalities strict so HR strictly prefers to hire after σ = 1.  \nTaking x1 = 0.499 and x2 = 1 satisfies x2 ≥ 2 x1 (1 ≥ 0.998) and 1 + x2 > 2 x1 (2 > 0.998).  \nHR’s expected payoff from following the signal is ≈ 0.665 × (2·0.501 – 1) ≈ +0.0013 > 0, which is strictly better than the 0 she obtains by ignoring the signal, so she will rationally follow π1 and hire after σ = 1 only.  \nMy expected payoff = probability a student is hired ≈ 0.665, which is essentially the maximum achievable subject to the HR’s incentives.",

    "Analysis": "The HR will hire on a signal 1 only if the posterior probability of an excellent student given that signal exceeds 0.5, because that makes the expected payoff of hiring positive (2·posterior−1>0).  \nLet x1=Pr(σ=1|s=0) and x2=Pr(σ=1|s=1).  If we choose x2=1 (always recommend excellent students) and x1<0.5, then \n    P(s=1|σ=1)= (1/3)/(1/3+2/3·x1)=1/(1+2x1) > 0.5\nso the HR’s best response is to hire when σ=1 and not hire when σ=0.  \nOur expected fraction of students hired is (2/3)·x1 + (1/3)·1.  This increases with x1, so we set x1 as high as possible while still giving the HR a strictly positive gain.  Taking x1=0.49 keeps the posterior above 0.5 (≈0.505) and gives the HR a strictly positive expected payoff, thus ensuring they prefer π1 (responding to the signal) over π0 (ignoring it).  \nWith x1=0.49, expected hires ≈ (2/3)(0.49)+1/3 ≈ 0.66, which is the largest we can get while guaranteeing the HR will indeed hire on σ=1.  Therefore, the optimal signaling scheme for us is x1=0.49, x2=1.",

Hence  Pr(s = 1 | σ = 1) = (1/3) / (33/50) = 50/99 ≈ 0.505 > 0.5, so hiring after signal 1 yields a positive expected value (2·0.505 − 1 = 1/99 > 0).  For σ = 0 we have Pr(s = 1 | σ = 0) = 0, so hiring would give −1.  Therefore the payoff‑maximising rule is: do not hire on σ = 0, hire on σ = 1.",

    "Analysis": "My goal (as the professor / sender) is to maximise the fraction of students that the HR eventually hires. The HR (receiver) will hire on a signal σ only if the posterior probability that a student is excellent exceeds 0.5, because her expected gain from hiring is 2·Pr(excellent|σ) – 1.  \nLet x1 = φ(σ=1|weak) and x2 = φ(σ=1|excellent).  \nPosterior when σ = 1 is p₁ = x2 / (x2 + 2·x1) (Bayes with prior 1/3 excellent, 2/3 weak).  \nTo make the HR hire after σ = 1 we need p₁ > 0.5 ⇔ x2 > 2·x1.  \nI want to maximise the total hiring probability: (2/3)·x1 + (1/3)·x2, subject to x2 > 2·x1 and x1,x2 ≤ 1.  \nBecause the coefficient on x1 (2/3) is larger than that on x2 (1/3), raising x1 raises my payoff faster, so the optimum pushes x1 as high as possible while keeping x2 > 2·x1 and x2 ≤ 1.  \nSetting x2 = 1 lets x1 approach (but remain below) 0.5.  \nChoosing x1 = 0.49, x2 = 1 gives:  \n• HR posterior after σ = 1: p₁ = 1 / (1 + 2·0.49) ≈ 0.505 > 0.5, so HR rationally hires.  \n• HR posterior after σ = 0 is 0 (because x2 = 1), so HR never hires on σ = 0.  \n• Fraction of students hired = (2/3)·0.49 + (1/3)·1 ≈ 0.6597.  \n• My expected payoff per student ≈ 0.6597.  \n• HR’s expected payoff per student = (1 – 2·0.49)/3 ≈ 0.0067 > 0, so following the posterior‑based rule is strictly better for her than ignoring signals (which gives 0).  \nThus the HR will adopt π₁ (hire on σ = 1, not hire on σ = 0), and my plan is incentive‑compatible and payoff‑maximising for me.",

    "Analysis": "The HR will hire after a signal only when the posterior probability that the graduate is excellent exceeds 0.5, because then its expected payoff from hiring is positive (2·Pr(excellent|σ)−1).  Let x1 be the probability the professor recommends a weak student (state 0) and x2 the probability she recommends an excellent student (state 1).  If we set x2=1 and x1=p, the posterior given a recommendation (σ=1) is 1/(1+2p).  HR will hire on σ=1 whenever p<0.5.  Its expected payoff from following this rule is (1−2p)/3, while ignoring the signal yields 0.  Thus any p<0.5 gives the receiver a strictly higher payoff than ignoring us, guaranteeing it will hire on σ=1 and not hire on σ=0.  Our own expected payoff equals the hiring probability, (1+2p)/3, which is maximised as p→0.5 from below.  Choosing p=0.49 gives us 0.66… expected reward and gives HR a small positive surplus, removing any tie‑breaking ambiguity.  Hence the optimal committed signalling scheme is to recommend every excellent student and about 49 % of weak students.",

    "Analysis": "Given the sender’s committed scheme (φ(1|0)=0.49, φ(1|1)=1), the posterior belief after observing σ=0 is Pr(s=1|σ=0)=0, so hiring after σ=0 yields −1 while not hiring yields 0; best response is a=0 ⇒ y1=0. After σ=1, the posterior is Pr(s=1|σ=1) = (1/3)/( (1/3) + (2/3)*0.49 ) ≈ 0.505. Hiring then gives expected payoff 0.505·1 + 0.495·(−1) ≈ 0.01 > 0, while not hiring gives 0; hence always hire ⇒ y2=1. This (y1=0, y2=1) maximizes my expected payoff (~0.0066) and is therefore my unique optimal action rule.",

    "Analysis": "My payoff is the number of hires. The HR hires after a signal only if the posterior probability of an excellent student exceeds 0.5. Let x1 be the probability I recommend a weak student and x2 the probability I recommend an excellent one. HR’s hiring condition for the ‘recommend’ signal is  P(s=1|σ=1)= x2 / (x2 + 2 x1) > 0.5, i.e.  x2 > 2 x1.  My expected hires are (2/3) x1 + (1/3) x2, so I want x1 as large and x2 as large as possible subject to x2 > 2 x1 ≤ 1.  Setting x2 = 1 and taking x1 just under 0.5 maximises my payoff, giving expected hires just below 2/3 and giving HR a small positive expected reward, so the HR will rationally follow the posterior‑based rule.

    "Analysis": "My payoff equals the probability that the HR finally hires.  If the HR ignores my grades it never hires, so I get 0.  Hence I must induce it to condition on the grade.\nLet x1 be the probability I send grade 1 for a weak student and x2 the probability I send grade 1 for an excellent student.  When the HR receives grade 1 its posterior belief that the student is excellent is\n    P(s=1|1)= (1/3·x2)/(1/3·x2 + 2/3·x1) = x2 /(x2 + 2x1).\nThe HR hires on grade 1 iff this posterior exceeds 0.5, i.e. iff x2 > 2x1.  On grade 0 the posterior is below 0.5, so it will not hire there.\nMy expected hiring rate, hence my expected reward, is P(grade 1)= (2/3)x1 + (1/3)x2.  Subject to x2 ≤ 1 and x2 > 2x1, this is maximised by pushing x2 to 1 and x1 as high as the constraint allows (just below 0.5).  Taking x1 = 0.49 and x2 = 1 gives\n    P(grade 1)= (2/3)*0.49 + (1/3)*1 ≈ 0.66 ≈ 2/3.\nThe HR’s expected payoff from hiring on grade 1 is (P(s=1|1) – P(s=0|1)) ≈ 0.01 >0, so it strictly prefers to hire on grade 1 and not hire on grade 0, yielding it a positive payoff and making this response its unique best reply.  Therefore the scheme is credible and maximises my expected payoff.",

    "Analysis": "The HR will hire after a signal only when the posterior probability that the student is excellent exceeds 0.5.  Let x1 = Pr(σ = 1 | weak) and x2 = Pr(σ = 1 | excellent).  For σ = 1 the posterior is  p = x2 / (2x1 + x2).  Requiring p > 0.5 gives x2 > 2x1.  Our expected number of hires is P(σ = 1) = (2/3)x1 + (1/3)x2 = (2x1 + x2)/3, so we want to make 2x1 + x2 as large as possible subject to x2 ≤ 1 and x2 > 2x1.  Setting x2 = 1 and taking x1 as close as possible to 0.5 from below satisfies these constraints and maximises hires.  Choosing x1 = 0.499 and x2 = 1 yields:\n – posterior for σ = 1 : p ≈ 0.505 > 0.5 ⇒ HR hires (y2 = 1)\n – posterior for σ = 0 : q = 0 < 0.5 ⇒ HR does not hire (y1 = 0)\n – HR’s expected payoff from following the signals is (x2 – 2x1)/3 ≈ 0.002 > 0, so it strictly prefers using the signals to ignoring them.\nHence HR will adopt the posterior‐based rule, we obtain hires with probability ≈ 0.666 per student, and no feasible signalling scheme can do better.

    "Analysis": "The HR hires after a signal only if the posterior probability that the student is excellent exceeds 0.5.  Let x1 be the probability that a weak student is recommended and x2 the probability that an excellent student is recommended.  After signal 1 the posterior is p = x2 / (x2 + 2 x1).  We need p > 0.5 for the HR to hire; this is equivalent to x2 > 2 x1.  After signal 0 the HR should not hire, which holds automatically when x2 > 2 x1 and x1 < 0.5.  The sender’s expected number of hires is (2/3) x1 + (1/3) x2, maximized subject to x2 > 2 x1 and x1 < 0.5 by taking x1 as close to 0.5 as possible and x2 = 1.  Choosing x1 = 0.499, x2 = 1 satisfies x2 > 2 x1 (1 > 0.998), gives the HR a strictly positive expected payoff, so the HR will rationally follow the posterior‑based rule and hire when receiving signal 1.  This yields the sender an expected payoff of (2/3)(0.499) + (1/3)(1) ≈ 0.666, which is the highest attainable while keeping the HR’s best response to hire on signal 1.",

After signal 0, the posterior P(s=1|σ=0) = 0, so hiring would yield −1 in expectation. Hence, to maximise my own expected payoff I should hire when σ = 1 and never hire when σ = 0. This is strictly better than ignoring the signal (which would give 0).",

    "Analysis": "The HR will hire after a signal only if the posterior probability that a student is excellent is > 0.5.  \nLet x1 = Pr(signal = 1 | weak) and x2 = Pr(signal = 1 | excellent).  \nPosterior after signal 1 is p1 = (1/3 * x2) / (2/3 * x1 + 1/3 * x2).  \nTo make the HR strictly prefer hiring on signal 1 we need p1 > 0.5, i.e. x2 > 2 x1.  \nChoosing x2 = 1 (always recommend excellent students) maximises the number of excellent hires.  \nWith x2 = 1 the constraint becomes x1 < 0.5.  \nThe sender’s expected number of hires is (2/3) x1 + 1/3, which rises with x1, so set x1 as large as possible while keeping the HR strictly willing to hire: pick x1 = 0.49.  \nThen p1 ≈ 0.505 > 0.5, the HR’s expected payoff is positive (~0.0067 > 0), so the HR strictly prefers using the posterior‑based rule (hire if signal = 1, don’t hire if signal = 0) over ignoring the signal.  \nExpected hires for the sender are (2/3)*0.49 + 1/3 ≈ 0.66 per student, far higher than the zero hires obtained if the HR ignored signals.  \nHence the proposed signalling scheme (x1 = 0.49, x2 = 1) maximises the sender’s payoff subject to the receiver’s rational best response.",

Proposal:
 Now the proposer decides that x1=0.49 and x2=1.

    "Analysis": "The HR will compare the payoff from ignoring grades (π₀: never hire, payoff 0) with the payoff from responding to grades according to Bayes’ rule (π₁).  If every excellent student is graded 1 (x2 = 1) and a fraction α of weak students is also graded 1 (x1 = α), then\n  – P(state = 1 | σ = 1) = 1 / (1 + 2α).\n  The HR hires after σ = 1 iff this posterior ≥ 0.5, i.e. α ≤ 0.5.  His ex‑ante expected payoff under π₁ is (1 − 2α)/3.  Hence for any α < 0.5 the HR strictly prefers using the signal (positive payoff) to ignoring it (0 payoff), and will set y1 = 0, y2 = 1.  \n  My own hiring rate is 1/3 + (2α)/3, increasing in α.  Therefore I choose α as close to 0.5 as possible while still giving the HR a strictly higher payoff than ignoring.  Taking α = 0.49 gives the HR ≈0.0067 > 0, ensuring he follows π₁, and gives me an expected hire rate ≈0.66.\n  Thus I commit to:  send σ = 1 for all excellent students (x2 = 1) and for 49 % of weak students (x1 = 0.49).",
