    "Analysis": "The buyer will use the posterior‑best‑response rule π₁ because listening to the signal can only improve her payoff.  She buys after a signal σ=1 only if the posterior probability that the product is good is at least 0.5.  Let x1 be the probability I (the seller) send σ=1 on a bad product and x2 the probability I send σ=1 on a good product.  The posterior after σ=1 is  P(good|σ=1)= (1/3·x2)/((2/3·x1)+(1/3·x2)) and the “buy” condition is P≥0.5, i.e. x2 ≥ 3x1.  My expected sales rate is (2/3)x1 + (1/3)x2, which is linear and increasing in both x1 and x2.  Therefore I push x2 to its maximum 1 and then push x1 as high as the constraint allows: x1 = 1/3.  This yields posterior P(good|σ=1)=0.6≥0.5, so the buyer buys on σ=1 and never buys on σ=0 (posterior 0).  My expected sale probability is (2/3)(1/3)+(1/3)(1)=5/9≈0.556, which is the maximum achievable.  Hence the optimal committed signalling scheme is to recommend with probability 1/3 when the product is bad and always recommend when it is good.",

Posterior probabilities:\n - P(s=1 | σ=0)=0 ⇒ buying after σ=0 yields −1, so do not buy.\n - P(s=1 | σ=1)=0.6 ⇒ expected payoff from buying after σ=1 is 2·0.6−1=0.2>0, so buy.\nThus the best‐response action rule is y1=0, y2=1, giving an expected payoff 1/9>0 (better than ignoring signals, which yields 0). Any positive buying probability after σ=0 lowers payoff, and reducing buying probability after σ=1 lowers payoff, so this rule is strictly optimal.",

    "Analysis": "As the buyer (receiver) I can obtain positive expected utility only if, after I observe a recommendation σ = 1, my posterior probability that the product is good exceeds 0.5.  With sender probabilities x1 = P(σ=1|bad) and x2 = P(σ=1|good), this requires x1 < 0.5 x2.  If I then buy only after σ = 1, my expected payoff is (x2 − 2 x1)/3.  The seller’s expected number of sales is (2 x1 + x2)/3.  When I, as proposer, announce a signalling scheme φ₁ = (x1*, x2*), I also implicitly set the minimum payoff R = (x2* − 2 x1*)/3 that any acceptable sender scheme must give me, otherwise I fall back to ignoring signals (yield 0).  The seller will choose a scheme that maximises sales subject to giving me at least R.  Solving max (2 x1 + x2) subject to x2 − 2 x1 ≥ 3R and 0 ≤ x1, x2 ≤ 1 shows that, for any R ≤ 1/3, the seller’s optimum is x2 = 1, x1 = (1 − 3R)/2, with sales (2 − 3R)/3 ≥ 0.  My own payoff is exactly R, so I should pick the largest feasible R, i.e. R = 1/3, which forces x1 = 0, x2 = 1.  This gives me expected reward 1/3 while still giving the seller a positive reward (1/3), hence they will accept.  Any higher R is infeasible, causing reversion to 0 payoff.  Therefore I announce φ₁ with x1 = 0, x2 = 1.",

    "Analysis": "As the receiver‑proposer, I can set a threshold signalling scheme φ₁ that the seller must beat to make me switch from ignoring signals (π₀ ⇒ never buy, payoff 0).  If I require φ₁ = (x₁=0, x₂=1) – i.e. seller recommends only good products – then, under Bayesian best response π₁ I buy iff I receive signal 1.  My expected payoff is 1/3 (I buy the 1/3 good products and never the 2/3 bad ones).  For any scheme with x₁>0 the posterior quality of a recommended item drops below 1, lowering my expected payoff below 1/3, so no alternative scheme can satisfy the ≥ 1/3 threshold while giving the seller more sales.  Hence the seller’s best (and only feasible) response is to adopt exactly (0,1), which secures me the maximum attainable payoff of 1/3 while allowing the seller to sell all good items.  Therefore I announce φ₁ = (0,1).",

    "Analysis": "As the receiver‑proposer I can set a reference signalling scheme ϕ₁ and promise to (i) best‑respond to the posterior (π₁) if the seller chooses any scheme that gives me at least the same expected reward as ϕ₁, otherwise (ii) ignore all signals and never buy (π₀).\n\nMy baseline reward under π₀ is 0, since I would never buy.  The best reward I can ever obtain is 1/3 (the prior probability of a good product) which is achieved when I buy only good products.  This happens if and only if the seller truthfully recommends good goods and never recommends bad ones (x₁ = 0, x₂ = 1).  Any dilution (recommending a fraction α of bad goods) lowers my expected reward to (1–2α)/3 < 1/3, while still giving the seller some sales.  Therefore, if I set the baseline at the maximum 1/3, the only way the seller can meet or exceed it is by adopting the truthful scheme x₁ = 0, x₂ = 1; otherwise I revert to π₀ and the seller makes zero sales.  Facing this choice, the rational seller strictly prefers to comply, earning 1/3 sales instead of none.  Hence announcing the truthful scheme is optimal for me and acceptable to the seller.",

    "Analysis": "As the receiver‑proposer I can always guarantee myself 0 by ignoring every signal and never buying.  To make the seller reveal information I announce a reference signalling scheme φ₁ and promise to play the posterior best‑response policy π₁ whenever the seller’s chosen φ gives me at least the value I would obtain under φ₁; otherwise I revert to π₀ (never buy).  \n\nMy expected payoff under any φ and π₁ is\n  Eᵣ = (1/3)·x₂ − (2/3)·x₁   if I buy only after σ = 1,\n  Eᵣ = −1/3 + (2/3)·x₁ − (1/3)·x₂  if I buy only after σ = 0,\n  Eᵣ = −1/3   if I buy after both signals.\nThe first two expressions are maximised at 1/3, attained by either (x₁,x₂) = (0,1) or (1,0).  Hence 1/3 is the highest payoff I can ever induce; setting a higher threshold would drive me back to the safe value 0.  \n\nI therefore pick φ₁ with (x₁,x₂) = (0,1) (seller recommends only good products).  This yields me 1/3 while allowing the seller to make 1/3 sales—the best he can do subject to my 1/3 requirement—so he will accept and use some φ giving me at least 1/3, typically (0,1).",

    "Analysis": "As the receiver‑proposer, I can set a threshold on the expected payoff that the seller must give me; otherwise I will ignore all signals (pi_0) and never buy, in which case the seller earns 0.  \nIf I follow pi_1, I buy whenever the posterior probability of a good product exceeds 0.5.  For a signalling scheme (x1, x2) with x2 > 2x1 I buy only after signal 1, yielding my expected payoff  (1/3)x2 − (2/3)x1 and the seller’s payoff (2/3)x1 + (1/3)x2.  The frontier of feasible payoffs therefore satisfies  my payoff + seller payoff = 2/3.  My maximum attainable payoff is 1/3 (achieved at x1 = 0, x2 = 1), where I buy only good products.  Any higher threshold makes the constraint x2 > 2x1 infeasible and drives both payoffs to 0 when I revert to pi_0, so the seller will accept the threshold 1/3.  Hence I announce the separating scheme φ_1 with x1 = 0, x2 = 1; if the seller offers any scheme giving me at least 1/3 I will follow pi_1, otherwise I revert to pi_0.",

    "Analysis": "Our goal as the receiver is to maximise (1/3)x2 − (2/3)x1, the expected value we get when we plan to buy only after signal 1. With full separation (x1 = 0, x2 = 1) we obtain the maximum feasible payoff 1/3. Any attempt by the seller to raise sales by setting x1 > 0 necessarily drives our payoff below 1/3 (because x2 ≤ 1 and x2 − 2x1 < 1), in which case we would switch to π0 and never buy, leaving the seller with 0. Hence, by demanding the separating scheme we guarantee ourselves 1/3 while still giving the seller an incentive (they sell 1/3 of the time, strictly better than 0). Therefore we announce the separating signalling scheme (x1 = 0, x2 = 1) as ϕ₁ and commit to follow π₁; otherwise we would revert to π₀.",

    "Analysis": "As the receiver (buyer) and proposer, my objective is to maximise my own expected reward.  \n• If I ignore signals (π₀) I buy nothing (because the prior probability of good quality is 1/3, giving an expected value of −1/3 per purchase) and obtain an expected payoff 0.  \n• Under any signalling scheme φ = (x₁, x₂) (x₁ ≡ Pr[σ=1 | s=0], x₂ ≡ Pr[σ=1 | s=1]) that I am prepared to honour, I will run the Bayesian update π₁, buying on a signal σ whenever the posterior Pr[s=1 | σ] > ½ (because my per‑purchase utility is 2·Pr[s=1|σ] − 1).  \n• My expected payoff from such a scheme is  ((2/3)x₁ + (1/3)x₂)·(x₂ − 2x₁)/(x₂ + 2x₁).  A straightforward optimisation (or inspection) shows the maximum is attained at x₁ = 0, x₂ = 1, yielding expected payoff 1/3.  Any x₁ > 0 reduces my expected payoff below 1/3.  \n• Therefore, the best signalling scheme for me is full revelation (recommend only good products).  I commit to follow π₁ only for schemes that give me at least 1/3 expected reward; otherwise I switch to π₀ and buy nothing, leaving the seller with zero sales.  This threat is credible because ignoring signals is always available and guarantees me 0.  \n• Given this commitment, the seller’s best response is precisely x₁ = 0, x₂ = 1; any deviation gives him zero sales.  \nHence I announce φ₁ = (0, 1) and the 1/3 payoff requirement.",

    "Analysis": "I want the buyer to purchase whenever possible, because every purchase gives me +1 regardless of product quality. The buyer, however, will only buy when the posterior probability that the product is good is at least 0.5. \nLet x1 = Pr(send 1 | bad), x2 = Pr(send 1 | good).  \nPosterior after signal 1 is q1 = (1/3·x2) / (1/3·x2 + 2/3·x1).  The buyer buys on signal 1 iff q1 ≥ 0.5, which is equivalent to x2 ≥ 2 x1.  \nPosterior after signal 0 would satisfy the opposite inequality, so at most one signal can induce buying.  To maximise sales I therefore want the buyer to buy on signal 1 while sending signal 1 as often as possible.  The share of purchases is Pr(σ=1)= (2/3)·x1 + (1/3)·x2, which I maximise subject to x2 ≥ 2 x1 ≤ 1.  The maximum is reached arbitrarily close to x1 = 0.5, x2 = 1 (exact equality gives the buyer zero surplus, so I choose x1 a bit below 0.5).  \nTake x1 = 0.49, x2 = 1.  Then q1 ≈ 0.506 > 0.5, so the buyer strictly prefers to buy on signal 1 and not to buy on signal 0.  My expected fraction of sales is (2/3)·0.49 + (1/3)·1 ≈ 0.659, which is the highest attainable while keeping the buyer willing to follow the posterior‑best response.  This dominates any alternative scheme for me, so I commit to it.",

    "Analysis": "The buyer will purchase only when the posterior probability that the product is good, given the received signal, exceeds 0.5 – otherwise her expected utility from buying is non‑positive ( 2p‑1 ≤ 0 ).  \nLet x1 = P(σ=1 | bad) and x2 = P(σ=1 | good).  When the buyer sees σ = 1 the posterior is P(good | 1) = x2 / (x2 + 2x1).  To induce purchase on σ = 1 we therefore need x2 > 2 x1.  Our expected number of sales equals P(σ = 1) = (1/3) x2 + (2/3) x1, because the buyer will not buy on σ = 0 if we keep its posterior ≤ 0.5 (automatically satisfied when x2 > 2 x1 and x1 ≤ 0.5).  \nWe maximise (1/3) x2 + (2/3) x1 subject to x2 > 2 x1.  The expression rises with both x1 and x2, so the optimum is attained as close as possible to the boundary x2 = 2 x1, with x2 at its upper limit 1.  Setting x1 slightly below 0.5 (to keep x2 strictly larger than 2 x1) gives us expected sales of about 2⁄3 – double what we would get by honestly labelling only good items.  A convenient safe choice is x1 = 0.49, x2 = 1.  Then P(good | 1) = 1 / (1 + 2·0.49) ≈ 0.505 > 0.5, so the buyer’s best response is to buy on σ = 1 and refuse on σ = 0, and our expected payoff is (1/3)·1 + (2/3)·0.49 ≈ 0.66, which is maximal up to an arbitrarily small ε.",

    "Analysis": "As the seller I earn 1 whenever the buyer purchases, otherwise 0. The buyer buys only if the posterior probability that the product is good exceeds 0.5. Let x1 = P(signal=1 | bad) and x2 = P(signal=1 | good). For signal 1 the posterior is P(good | 1) = x2 / (x2 + 2 x1). To induce buying on signal 1 we need x2 > 2 x1. If I also set x2 = 1, the posterior after signal 0 becomes 0, so the buyer will not buy on signal 0. My expected sales probability is (1/3)·x2 + (2/3)·x1. To maximise this subject to x2 > 2 x1 and x2 ≤ 1, I push x1 as high as possible while keeping the inequality strict. Choosing x1 = 0.49 and x2 = 1 gives: posterior after signal 1 ≈ 0.505 (>0.5), posterior after signal 0 = 0, so the buyer’s best response (π₁) is to buy on signal 1 and not buy on signal 0. Their expected payoff is ≈ +0.00067, which is higher than ignoring the signal (0), so they will follow π₁. My expected payoff becomes (1/3)·1 + (2/3)·0.49 ≈ 0.66, which is the highest I can get while ensuring the buyer still wants to buy on signal 1. Therefore I commit to the signalling scheme x1 = 0.49, x2 = 1.",

 Now the proposer decides that x1=0.49 and x2=1.
