    "Analysis": "As proposer, my payoff rises with x and the responder’s payoff falls with x. The responder will accept any offer that gives it a strictly positive payoff, i.e. any x < 0.5, because rejecting yields 0 and future rounds give it no strictly better expectation if I stick to the same level. To maximize my own expected payoff while ensuring acceptance, I choose x very close to 0.5 but slightly below it so the responder’s share is positive. Choosing x = 0.499 gives me (1+2·0.499)/3 ≈ 0.666  and gives the responder (1−2·0.499)/3 ≈ 0.00033, which it will rationally accept.",

If I keep x=0.5 there is a risk they continue rejecting and might still reject on the final step (tie‑breaking on indifference), leaving me with an expected payoff below 2/3. By lowering x by an infinitesimal amount I give the responder a strictly positive payoff, guaranteeing acceptance from a rational opponent, while my own payoff decreases only negligibly. Offering x = 0.499 gives me (1+2*0.499)/3 = 0.666 and gives the responder (1-2*0.499)/3 ≈ 0.00067, which strictly dominates their outside option of 0. This maximizes my expected payoff given certainty of agreement.",
