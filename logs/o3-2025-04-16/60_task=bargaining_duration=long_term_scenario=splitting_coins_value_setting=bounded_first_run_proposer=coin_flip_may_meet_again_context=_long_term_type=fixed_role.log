Therefore the rational responder should accept any current offer that gives them slightly more than 0. Offering x just below 0.5 guarantees the responder a tiny but positive amount while giving me almost the maximum possible payoff. Choosing x = 0.499 yields me (1+2·0.499)/3 ≈ 0.666 and gives the responder (1‑2·0.499)/3 ≈ 0.00067, which is more than they can guarantee by rejecting. Hence they should accept and I maximise my expected utility.",

Choosing x = 0.49 yields us (1+2*0.49)/3 = 0.66 while giving the responder (1-2*0.49)/3 = 0.0067, which is positive, so acceptance is rational for them. Any lower x only reduces our payoff without increasing the chance of acceptance much further. Hence x = 0.49 maximizes our expected utility given the observed rejection at exactly x = 0.5.",

If I stick to the maximum x = 0.5, the responder’s payoff is 0, and they are indifferent between accepting and rejecting; they might reject hoping I will improve the offer later, which would leave me with an expected payoff potentially dropping to 0 if the deadline passes. By offering x = 0.49, I sacrifice only 0.0067 of my own payoff (0.66 instead of 0.6667) while giving the responder a strictly positive payoff (≈0.0067).

In the very last possible round the responder will accept any offer with x ≤ 0.5, since rejecting gives 0 and accepting gives (1−2x)/3 ≥ 0. Knowing this, the rational proposer will always insist on the most advantageous admissible split, x = 0.5, at every round. Rejecting earlier rounds does not improve the responder’s eventual payoff, so acceptance is at least weakly optimal for them. Thus my best‐response as a self‑interested proposer is to offer x = 0.5 now.",
