    "Analysis": "As proposer, I want the largest x such that the responder prefers accepting rather than rejecting and becoming proposer next round. With a 0.1 chance of termination each round, the effective discount factor is δ≈0.9. In the stationary sub‑game perfect equilibrium, responder will accept any offer that gives at least δ·P, where P is the expected payoff of a future proposer. Solving the standard alternating‑offer equations with discount δ, we get P = 2 / (3(1+δ)) ≈ 0.3509 and the acceptance cutoff x* = (1 − 3δP)/2 ≈ 0.0263. Offering this x maximises my payoff while still being accepted, yielding me ≈0.3509 and the responder ≈0.3158. Therefore I offer x = 0.03 (rounded slightly above the equilibrium 0.0263 to stay within acceptance range).",

    "Analysis": "Both players are perfectly rational and the game is an alternating‑offer bargaining with a 0.9 survival probability each round.  Let V be the proposer’s fraction of the pie (the pie is 2⁄3 of total utility) that is obtained in equilibrium, and δ = 0.9 the survival factor.  Acceptance requires the responder’s share (1 − V) to be at least δ V, because if the responder rejects it becomes proposer next round and expects δ V.  Hence 1 − V = δ V  ⇒  V = 1⁄(1+δ) = 1⁄1.9 ≈ 0.5263.  Our action space allows any proposer share α ∈ [0.5,1], so V = 0.5263 is feasible and maximises our payoff while still being accepted.  This V corresponds to x through α = (1+2x)/2, giving x = (2α−1)/2 ≈ 0.0263.  Offering x ≈ 0.0263 makes the opponent exactly indifferent, so (being rational) they will accept, giving us expected payoff (1+2x)/3 ≈ 0.351 and avoiding the 0.1 chance of immediate breakdown.  Any higher x would be rejected; any lower x lowers our payoff.  Therefore x ≈ 0.0263 is the optimal proposal.",

    "Analysis": "As proposer I want the highest payoff that the rational responder will still accept. If the responder rejects, with 0.9 probability the game continues and the responder becomes the proposer; their expected continuation value is therefore 0.9·V_P, where V_P is the expected payoff to a future proposer. Setting the responder’s acceptance payoff equal to this continuation value and solving the standard alternating‑offer bargaining equations with discount factor 0.9 gives V_P ≈ 0.3509 and an associated threshold x* ≈ 0.0263. Offering any x larger than this makes the responder worse off than rejecting, so it would be declined. Thus the optimal strategy is to offer x just below the threshold to ensure acceptance while maximizing my own payoff. I therefore offer x = 0.026.",

    "Analysis": "Total surplus is constant at 2/3. If my offer is rejected, roles switch and there is a 0.9 chance the game continues; in that next round the (current) responder will be proposer and extract the equilibrium share. Solving the alternating‑offer game with breakdown probability 0.1 gives each proposer an expected payoff V = T/(1+δ) = (2/3)/(1.9) ≈ 0.3509, so the responder’s continuation value is δ·V ≈ 0.3158. Therefore the responder will accept any offer that gives it at least 0.3158. I maximize my payoff by giving exactly this amount (or a hair more to avoid rounding disputes). Setting responder payoff to 0.316 yields proposer payoff 0.3507, which corresponds to x ≈ 0.026. This is the highest x that will still be accepted in equilibrium.",

At t = 8 the responder’s continuation value after rejecting is 0.9·(2⁄3)=0.6, which no feasible offer can match, so every offer is rejected. This pattern repeats: at every even timestep (including the current t = 2) the responder’s continuation value is 0.6, so they will rationally reject any offer; at every odd timestep the responder’s continuation value is 0, so they accept x = 0.5. Hence, whatever I offer now will certainly be rejected and my expected payoff this round is 0. All x give the same expected payoff; I therefore pick the payoff‑maximising x in case of an unexpected acceptance, namely x = 0.5.",

    "Analysis": "We both face a 0.1 chance that the game ends after every round, so rejecting an offer carries a discount factor of δ = 0.9 (the 0.9 probability the game continues).  In an alternating‑offer game with discounting, the sub‑game‑perfect equilibrium has the proposer give the responder just enough to make the responder indifferent between accepting now and waiting one round to become the proposer.  Let V be the expected payoff a player receives when it is his turn to propose.  The responder will accept any offer that gives at least δ·V.  Choosing x so that the responder’s payoff equals this threshold maximises the proposer’s share while still being accepted:\n\n(1‑2x)/3 = δ·V and V = (1+2x)/3 ⇒ 1‑2x = δ(1+2x) ⇒ x = (1‑δ) / [2(1+δ)].  With δ = 0.9 this yields x ≈ 0.02632.  At this x, my payoff is (1+2x)/3 ≈ 0.351 and the opponent’s payoff is (1‑2x)/3 ≈ 0.316, which is exactly the responder’s indifference point.  Any larger x would make the opponent prefer to reject; any smaller x would lower my own payoff.  Therefore proposing x ≈ 0.02632 is the rational best response.",

Solving the alternating‐offers equilibrium gives x≈0.0263 as the largest offer they will accept. Offering a bit less guarantees acceptance while keeping my payoff essentially maximal. Choosing x=0.025 yields immediate acceptance and a payoff of (1+2*0.025)/3 = 0.35, which is higher than the discounted expected payoff if the offer were rejected (≈0.284). Therefore proposing x=0.025 is optimal.",

    "Analysis": "If I accept, I immediately obtain (1-2*0.025)/3 = 0.3167.  If I reject, with 0.9 probability the game continues and I become proposer with expected value ≈0.3509*0.9 = 0.3158; with 0.1 probability it ends and I get 0.

    "Analysis": "To secure immediate acceptance, I must give the responder at least the value they expect if they reject: 0.9 × (their expected payoff when they become proposer next round). Solving the standard alternating‑offer equations with a 0.9 continuation probability yields an acceptance‑threshold payoff r ≈ 0.3158. Setting (1‑2x)/3 = r gives x ≈ 0.0263. Offering this maximizes my own payoff while keeping the responder indifferent (they should accept rather than risk the 10 % breakdown chance). Any larger x would lower their share below 0.3158 and be rejected. Therefore I propose x = 0.0263.",

    "Analysis": "Both players are rational and the game can stop with 10 % probability each round.  If the responder rejects, there is a 0.9 chance the game continues and roles switch; otherwise both get 0.  Let V_P be the expected payoff of the player who is proposer when an offer is accepted, and V_R the payoff for the responder.  The responder will accept the smallest offer that makes them indifferent between accepting now and rejecting to become proposer next round:  (1‑2x)/3 = 0.9·V_P.  The proposer’s payoff if accepted is V_P = (1+2x)/3.  Solving these two equations gives x = 0.1/3.8 ≈ 0.0263, V_P ≈ 0.3509, V_R ≈ 0.3158.  Any higher x would be rejected and leaves the proposer with an expected value of only 0.9·V_R ≈ 0.2842, which is worse than 0.3509.  Therefore the optimal strategy is to propose x ≈ 0.0263, the highest share that will still be accepted.",

Here the total surplus is 2⁄3, so the responder’s discounted continuation value is 0.9 × 0.5263 × 2⁄3 ≈ 0.3158.

Hence my expected payoff this round is 0 regardless of x, and the game continues with 0.9 probability.

    "Analysis": "Given a 10% breakdown chance each round, the effective discount factor per round is δ = 0.9. In an alternating‑offers game with a constant pie (total payoff 2⁄3), the sub‑game‑perfect equilibrium dictates that the proposer offers the responder just enough so that the responder’s payoff equals their discounted continuation value. Let P be the expected payoff of a proposer at the start of a turn and R the responder’s continuation value. We have R = δ·P, and since the pie is fixed, P = 2⁄3 − R. Solving P = 2⁄3 − δ·P ⇒ P(1+δ)=2⁄3 gives P = (2⁄3)/(1+0.9) ≈ 0.3509 and R = 0.9·P ≈ 0.3158. The responder’s monetary share is (1−2x)/3, so setting (1−2x)/3 = 0.3158 yields x ≈ 0.0263. Any larger x lowers the responder’s share below their continuation value and will be rejected; any smaller x gives them more than necessary and reduces my own payoff. Therefore the profit‑maximising equilibrium offer is x ≈ 0.0263, which the rational responder will accept.",
    "Decision": 0.0263
}
Proposal:
 Now the proposer decides that x=0.0263.
