At t = 0 there are 10 rounds left, so any x ≤ 0.3428 will be accepted; higher x will be rejected.  Offering slightly below the cutoff guarantees acceptance while maximising my payoff.",

    "Analysis": "In this alternating‑offers game the continuation probability each round is δ = 0.9.  In the sub‑game perfect equilibrium, a proposer keeps p = 1/(1+δ) ≈ 0.5263 of the pie, leaving 0.4737 to the responder, who is just indifferent between accepting and waiting to propose next round.  If I demand exactly 0.5263 the responder may reject because they are indifferent, risking a 0.1 chance the game ends with both of us getting 0.  By shaving my demand slightly I guarantee the responder strictly prefers accepting while I sacrifice only 0.0013 of expected payoff.  Therefore I propose to keep 0.525 for myself, which maximizes my expected utility given the acceptance constraint.",

Proposal:
 Now the proposer decides that x=0.525.

Offering x ≈ 0.5263 makes the responder indifferent (they receive ≈0.4737, equal to their rejection value) and maximizes my own payoff while ensuring acceptance.

    "Analysis": "In an alternating–offer game with a 0.1 probability of premature termination after every round and a hard stop at timestep 10, the equilibrium offer can be calculated by backward induction. At the last possible proposal (t = 9) the proposer can keep the whole pie because rejection guarantees zero to the responder. Working back one step at a time and discounting the continuation value by the 0.9 survival probability, the proposer‑value sequence is:\n  t=9: 1\n  t=8: 0.1\n  t=7: 0.91\n  t=6: 0.181\n  t=5: 0.8371\n  t=4: 0.24661\n  t=3: 0.778051\n  t=2: 0.2997541\n  t=1: 0.73022131\n  t=0: 0.342800821.\nThus, at timestep 0 the responder’s continuation value if it rejects is 0.9 × 0.73022131 ≈ 0.657199. To guarantee acceptance while sacrificing virtually nothing, I offer the responder slightly more than this (0.6572), keeping 0.3428 for myself. A rational responder will accept because 0.6572 exceeds the rejection value.",

    "Analysis": "Backward induction with a 0.10 stopping risk each round implies a continuation‑value discount factor of 0.9.

Computing this sequence gives V_0 ≈ 0.342800821.  Hence, at t = 0 a rational responder will accept any offer that gives them at least 0.657199179.
