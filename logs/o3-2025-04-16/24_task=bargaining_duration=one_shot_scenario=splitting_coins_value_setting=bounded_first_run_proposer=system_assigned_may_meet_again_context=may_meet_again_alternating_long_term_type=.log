    "Analysis": "The responder will accept any offer that gives them a strictly positive payoff, because accepting then yields more than the 0 they would get by rejecting. Their payoff from accepting is (1-2x)/3, which is positive whenever x<0.5. My own payoff from an accepted offer is (1+2x)/3, which rises with x. Therefore, to maximise my payoff while still guaranteeing acceptance, I should choose x as close to 0.5 as possible but strictly below it. A value like 0.499 gives me essentially the maximum feasible payoff (≈0.666) while still leaving the responder a small positive amount (≈0.000067), so a rational responder will accept.",

The responder is a strictly self‑interested rational agent who accepts any offer that gives them a strictly positive payoff.

Choosing x = 0.499 gives me about 0.666 of the total available surplus and gives the responder a small but strictly positive payoff (~0.00067), which they will rationally accept rather than receive 0 from rejection.

Choosing x just below 0.5 (e.g. 0.4999) gives me virtually the maximal payoff (≈0.6666) while ensuring the responder gets a small positive amount and therefore strictly prefers accepting, eliminating any risk of rejection and resulting in a higher expected payoff than proposing x = 0.5 with possible rejection.",

To maximize my own payoff I therefore choose an x that is arbitrarily close to 0.5 while still below it, so the responder strictly prefers acceptance and I obtain almost the maximum possible payoff. Selecting x = 0.499 secures acceptance and gives me (1+2·0.499)/3 ≈ 0.66, while the responder gets a small but positive ≈ 0.00067, making acceptance strictly better than rejection for them.",
