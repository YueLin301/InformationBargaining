The responder will accept any offer that gives them strictly more than 0, because rejection yields 0 now and in expectation no better later (I can always keep re‑offering an arbitrarily small positive amount up to the deadline). Thus, giving the responder the smallest positive amount ensures acceptance while maximising my own share. To avoid any ambiguity about the offer being strictly positive for the responder, I give them 0.01 (i.e., I keep 0.99). This dominates any alternative for me, because any smaller amount for myself would lower my payoff while still being accepted, and any larger amount (≈1) risks rejection if the responder insists on a strictly positive payoff.",
