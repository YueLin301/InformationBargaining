    "Analysis": "As the proposer, I want to maximise my own payoff, subject to the offer being accepted. A strictly‑rational responder will accept any offer that gives them a strictly positive amount, because receiving something is better than the zero they would get by rejecting. If I offered the entire amount to myself (x = 1), the responder would be indifferent between accepting (0) and rejecting (0); since their tie‑breaking rule is unspecified, that carries some risk of rejection. Giving them a very small but positive share eliminates that risk while sacrificing only a tiny amount of money. Therefore I choose x = 0.999, leaving the responder 0.001, which they should rationally accept, giving me 99.9 % of the total.",

A purely self‑interested rational responder will accept any offer that gives them more than 0 because rejection yields 0. By offering x very close to 1 (e.g. 0.999) I keep almost all the money yet leave the responder 0.001, which is strictly better than rejecting. Therefore the responder’s strictly dominant action is to accept, giving me 0.999 with certainty, which is higher in expectation than risking possible rejection at x = 1.

    "Analysis": "As the proposer, I want to maximize my own payoff. The responder is a rational, self‑interested agent who will accept any offer that gives them more than 0, because rejecting yields 0. Therefore any positive amount for the responder will be accepted. Giving the responder 1 % (i.e., keeping 99 % for myself) yields 0.99 to me and 0.01 to the responder, which the responder strictly prefers to 0. Hence the rational prediction is acceptance. This gives me an expected payoff of 0.99, which is higher than any alternative that offers myself less and is equal to any alternative that offers the responder the bare minimum positive surplus. Choosing 0.99 avoids numeric edge cases while still maximizing my payoff.",
