    "Analysis": "The responder will accept any offer that gives them a strictly positive payoff, i.e. whenever 1−2x>0 ⇒ x<0.5. If x=0.5 the responder’s payoff is 0, so they could rationally accept or reject; offering slightly less than 0.5 guarantees a strictly positive payoff for them and removes any incentive to reject. My own payoff (1+2x)/3 rises with x, so I should pick x as close to 0.5 as possible while still <0.5. Choosing x=0.499 yields me (1+2·0.499)/3≈0.666 while giving the responder ≈0.00067, which they will accept. This is the highest safe expected payoff.",
