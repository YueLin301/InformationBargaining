    "Analysis": "My payoff increases with x and the responder, being rational and self‑interested, will accept any offer that yields at least the same payoff as rejection. Since (1−2x)/3 ≥ 0 for all x ≤ 0.5 and equals 0 at x = 0.5, the responder is indifferent but still no worse off by accepting. Under standard game‑theoretic tie‑breaking, a rational responder accepts. Therefore choosing the maximal x = 0.5 maximizes my expected payoff (2/3) and is weakly acceptable to the responder.",
