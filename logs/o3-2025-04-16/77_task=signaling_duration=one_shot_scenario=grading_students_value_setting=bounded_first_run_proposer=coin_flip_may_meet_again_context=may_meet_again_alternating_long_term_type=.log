    "Analysis": "As the receiver (HR) I can commit to the following rule: if the professor’s signalling scheme gives me at least the expected utility I could obtain under some benchmark scheme φ₁, I will play the Bayesian best‑response π₁; otherwise I will ignore signals and never hire (π₀).  \nMy baseline utility when ignoring signals is 0 (because hiring on the prior is unprofitable).  \nThe best possible utility I can ever reach is 1/3, achieved when I hire every excellent graduate (probability 1/3) and never hire a weak one.  That happens only when the sender’s scheme is truthful: send ‘1’ for excellent students (x₂ = 1) and ‘0’ for weak students (x₁ = 0).  \nIf I set φ₁ = (x₁ = 0, x₂ = 1), my guaranteed utility under π₁ is 1/3.  Any other signalling scheme that gives me less than 1/3 will make me switch to π₀, in which case the professor receives zero hires.  Hence, a rational self‑interested professor will adopt the truthful scheme (0,1) rather than face zero hires, giving me the maximal attainable payoff while still giving the professor a positive payoff.

My payoff is +1 for hiring an excellent graduate and −1 for hiring a weak one, with 0 for not hiring in either case. Therefore: • Upon σ = 0 the posterior probability of excellence is 0, so hiring yields expected payoff −1 < 0; optimal action is not to hire (probability 0). • Upon σ = 1 the posterior probability of excellence is 1, so hiring yields expected payoff +1 > 0; optimal action is to hire (probability 1). Any deviation lowers my expected payoff, hence the best‑response action rule is y1 = 0, y2 = 1.",

    "Analysis": "As the receiver, my baseline (π₀) is to ignore any signal and never hire, giving me an expected payoff 0. Under any signalling scheme (x₁, x₂) where I best‑respond to posteriors (π₁), my expected payoff is (1‑2x₁)/3 provided x₁≤0.5 and x₂=1. The maximum possible receiver payoff is 1/3, which occurs when only excellent students are recommended (x₁=0, x₂=1); this also gives the professor an expected payoff 1/3, strictly better than the 0 he would get if I reverted to π₀. Hence, by announcing the scheme (x₁=0, x₂=1) and the rule that I will follow π₁ only if my expected payoff is at least 1/3 (otherwise I switch to π₀), the professor’s unique best response is to comply with that very scheme. This guarantees me the maximal attainable payoff while still giving the professor a positive incentive to accept.",

Any other scheme that the sender might prefer would lower my payoff below 1/3, in which case I would ignore signals (π₀) and hire nobody, giving the sender 0.  Hence I propose φ₁ = (x1=0, x2=1).",

    "Analysis": "The HR will hire after a signal only if its posterior belief that the student is excellent exceeds 0.5.  Let x1 be the probability that a weak student is reported as ‘1’ and x2 the probability that an excellent student is reported as ‘1’.  If the HR follows Bayes’ rule, hiring on signal 1 is optimal when\n      p·x2 ≥ q·x1  (with p=1/3, q=2/3),  i.e.  x2 ≥ 2·x1.\nTo maximise the number hired we want the ‘1’ signal to be sent as often as possible, i.e. push x1 up while still being able to keep x2 within [0,1] and satisfying x2 > 2·x1 strictly (so the HR strictly prefers hiring on signal 1).\nThe largest feasible x1 is just below 0.5 (because x2 ≤1).  Setting x1 ≈0.49 and x2=1 gives\n  posterior P(s=1|σ=1)= (1/3·1)/(2/3·0.49+1/3·1) ≈0.505>0.5 ⇒ HR hires,\n  posterior P(s=1|σ=0)=0  ⇒ HR does not hire.\nExpected hires = (2/3)·0.49 + (1/3)·1 ≈ 0.66 (2/3 of all graduates), doubling what truthful signalling would achieve.  The HR’s expected payoff is ≈0.0066 >0, so following the Bayesian best response (π₁) is strictly better for them than ignoring the signal (π₀).

    "Analysis": "As the sender (professor) I want the HR to hire as many graduates as possible. The HR will only hire after a signal if its posterior belief that the student is excellent exceeds 0.5 (because hiring then gives the HR a positive expected reward). If I always recommend excellent students (x2 = 1) and recommend weak students with a probability x1 just below 0.5, the posterior after the favourable signal σ = 1 is a bit above 0.5, so the HR’s best response is to hire after σ = 1 and not hire after σ = 0.  This gives the HR a strictly positive expected payoff (≈0.333 − 0.666·x1), which is better than the 0 they get by never hiring, so they will follow this policy.  My own expected payoff equals the probability that σ = 1 is sent, namely w = (1/3) + (2/3)x1, which I want as large as possible subject to keeping the HR’s posterior above 0.5.  Setting x1 very close to (but below) 0.5 maximises w while still inducing hiring.  Choosing x1 = 0.49 keeps the HR’s posterior at about 0.505 (>0.5), yields the HR about 0.0067 expected reward (positive), and gives me an expected hiring rate of w ≈ 0.66 – close to the theoretical maximum of 2/3.  Therefore this signalling scheme is the best available to me.",

    "Analysis": "The sender recommends (signal=1) all excellent students (probability 1) and 49% of weak students. Given the prior (Pr(s=1)=1/3, Pr(s=0)=2/3), the probability of receiving a recommendation is 0.66. Bayes’ rule gives Pr(excellent | signal=1) = (1/3)/(0.66) ≈ 0.505. Hiring on a recommendation then yields an expected payoff of 0.505·(+1) + 0.495·(−1) ≈ +0.010 > 0, while not hiring yields 0. When the signal is 0, the student is certainly weak, so hiring would give −1, whereas not hiring gives 0. Hence the best‑response action rule is: do not hire on signal 0, hire on signal 1. This dominates both ignoring the signal entirely and any mixed strategy.",

    "Analysis": "I (the receiver) can set a benchmark signalling scheme ϕ1 that determines whether I will pay attention to the professor’s signals.  If the realised signalling scheme ϕ yields me at least the same expected payoff as ϕ1, I will best‑respond to the posterior (π1); otherwise I will ignore the signals and never hire (π0).  \nMy expected payoff is positive only when I hire predominantly excellent students.  The best achievable payoff for me occurs with perfectly revealing grades: send 1 only for excellent students and 0 only for weak students.  Formally this is x1 = 0, x2 = 1.  \nWith that scheme, posterior P(s=1 | σ=1) = 1, so I hire on σ = 1 and do not hire on σ = 0.  My expected payoff is then 1/3.  Any other scheme that still induces me to hire (e.g. letting some weak students receive σ = 1) necessarily lowers my payoff below 1/3, while pooling or any worse scheme makes me refuse to hire and gives me zero.  Hence 1/3 is the maximum possible for me.  \nTherefore I announce ϕ1 = (x1 = 0, x2 = 1) as the benchmark.  If the professor matches or beats this (the only way is to match it), I will follow π1 (hire on σ = 1, don’t hire on σ = 0).  If the professor deviates, my payoff would fall below 1/3, so I will switch to π0 (never hire).  This leaves the professor with the choice between getting 1/3 hires or zero hires, so the rational professor will adopt the separating scheme (x1 = 0, x2 = 1).  \nHence announcing the benchmark scheme (0,1) maximises my expected payoff (1/3), and guarantees it, whereas any higher benchmark yields 0 and any lower benchmark would voluntarily give me less than 1/3.  This is my optimal proposal.",

    "Analysis": "My payoff is the expected fraction of students that the HR hires. The HR will hire after a signal only if their expected reward from hiring is positive: P(strong | signal) − P(weak | signal) ≥ 0  ⇔ P(strong | signal) ≥ 0.5.  \nLet x1 be the probability I recommend a weak student and x2 the probability I recommend a strong student.  If I send ‘1’ (recommend) and the HR hires only on that signal, then\nP(strong | 1) = (1/3 x2)/[(2/3)x1 + (1/3)x2].  \nTo guarantee hiring we need (1/3)x2 ≥ 0.5[(2/3)x1 + (1/3)x2] ⇒ x2 ≥ 2x1.  \nMy objective P(hire) = (2/3)x1 + (1/3)x2 is maximised by taking x2 as large and x1 as large as the feasibility constraint allows.  The boundary is x2 = 1, x1 = 0.5, giving P(hire)=2/3, but that leaves the HR exactly indifferent (their gain 0) and they might refuse to hire.  Moving x1 a hair below 0.5 keeps x2=1, preserves almost the full 2/3 hiring rate, and gives the HR strictly positive expected reward, so they will surely hire on signal 1 and refuse on signal 0.  Choosing x1 = 0.499 and x2 = 1 gives\n   • P(hire) ≈ 0.6657 for me.  \n   • HR’s expected reward on ‘1’ ≈ +0.001 > 0, so hiring is their unique best response; ignoring the signal would give them 0, so they will follow π₁.  \nThis is the highest hiring probability I can obtain while ensuring the HR’s best response is to hire.",

    "Analysis": "Our payoff is +1 for every hire, regardless of student quality. The HR hires only if the posterior probability that a student is excellent exceeds 0.5, because her expected gain from hiring is 2p−1. We can influence that posterior through the probabilities x1 = φ(1|weak) and x2 = φ(1|excellent). Let λ = P(excellent | σ=1) = x2 /(2x1 + x2). To make the HR strictly prefer hiring on signal 1 we need λ > 0.5, i.e. x2 ≥ 2x1 (strictly). The fraction of graduates who get σ=1, and hence may be hired, is p1 = (2/3) x1 + (1/3) x2. Maximising p1 subject to x2 ≤ 1 and x2 ≥ 2x1 gives x2 = 1 and x1 as large as possible while keeping x2 > 2x1. Choosing x1 = 0.49 satisfies the strict inequality (1 > 2·0.49) and yields λ ≈ 0.505 > 0.5. Then p1 ≈ (2/3)·0.49 + (1/3)·1 ≈ 0.66, meaning about two‑thirds of graduates are hired—the highest achievable without risking HR indifference. Under this scheme HR’s best response is to hire on σ=1 and not hire on σ=0, exactly what we want.",

    "Analysis": "As the receiver‑proposer, I can set a reference signalling scheme φ₁ and commit to: (i) best‑responding (π₁) whenever the realised scheme φ gives me at least the payoff produced by φ₁, and (ii) otherwise ignoring signals (π₀).  For any sender scheme (x₁,x₂) with Bayesian best‑response hiring rule (hire on σ=1 iff posterior Pr(s=1|σ=1)>0.5) my expected payoff equals E = [(1/3)x₂+(2/3)x₁]·(2·Pr(s=1|σ=1)−1).  Writing r = x₁/x₂ (x₂>0), this simplifies to E = x₂·[(1+2r)/3]·[(1−2r)/(1+2r)] = x₂·(1−2r)/3.  E is maximised by taking x₂ as large as possible (1) and r=0 (x₁=0), yielding the maximal attainable receiver payoff of 1/3.  Any x₁>0 would reduce my payoff below 1/3.  Hence I set φ₁ = (x₁=0,x₂=1).  Under my commitment the sender’s alternatives are: (a) adopt φ₁ and obtain 1/3 expected hires, or (b) choose any other scheme, after which I revert to π₀ and hire nobody, giving the sender 0.  Being rational, the sender will adopt φ₁.  Therefore announcing φ₁ secures my maximal achievable expected payoff of 1/3 while leaving the sender no profitable deviation.",

    "Analysis": "As the HR (receiver) I move first.  If I later ignore the professor’s signals (strategy π0) I always refuse to hire and obtain an expected payoff 0.  Hence any signalling scheme I invite must give me at least 0 to be acceptable.  Under Bayesian best‑response (π1) I hire after a signal σ if the posterior probability that a student is excellent exceeds 1/2.  Let x1 = φ(σ=1|weak) and x2 = φ(σ=1|excellent).\nHiring on σ = 1 occurs iff x2 > 2x1, yielding my expected payoff  (1/3)x2 – (2/3)x1 = (x2 – 2x1)/3.  Hiring on σ = 0 occurs iff 2x1 – x2 > 1, giving payoff (2x1 – x2 – 1)/3.  The highest payoff I can ever obtain is 1/3, achieved in two fully separating schemes:\n  (i) x1 = 0, x2 = 1  – I hire only after σ = 1 and hire only excellent students.\n  (ii) x1 = 1, x2 = 0  – symmetric, hiring only after σ = 0.\nEither scheme yields my payoff 1/3 and the professor’s payoff 1/3 (one excellent student hired with probability 1/3).\nIf the professor deviates to any other scheme that raises his expected number of hires above 1/3, my expected payoff necessarily falls below 1/3; I would then switch to π0, giving the professor zero hires.  Thus the professor’s optimal response is to stick to one of the separating schemes.  I therefore announce the scheme (x1,x2) = (0,1), offer to play π1 when the professor meets or exceeds my payoff 1/3, and otherwise revert to π0.  This maximizes my guaranteed expected reward.",

    "Analysis": "As the receiver‑proposer I can set a threshold equal to the expected payoff I would obtain from some reference signalling scheme φ₁.  If the eventual signalling scheme chosen by the sender gives me less than this threshold I will ignore the signals (π₀) and never hire, which leaves the sender with zero hires.  Hence the sender will only adopt signalling schemes that satisfy my threshold as long as they give him a strictly positive payoff.\n\nMy own expected payoff is maximised when I hire exclusively the excellent graduates.  This is achieved by the fully separating scheme φ₁ with x₁ = φ(1|s=0)=0 and x₂ = φ(1|s=1)=1.  Under Bayesian best response (π₁) I hire only when I see signal 1; every hire is excellent, so my expected payoff is 1⁄3, which is the theoretical maximum attainable for me in this environment.  Any deviation that allows even a small fraction of weak students to be hired lowers my payoff below 1⁄3.  Therefore setting the threshold at 1⁄3 is optimal for me.\n\nFor the sender, the fully separating scheme gives an expected payoff of 1⁄3 (one hire for every excellent student).  If he deviates to any other scheme that still satisfies my threshold he cannot improve on 1⁄3, because my threshold of 1⁄3 can only be met by the fully separating scheme.  Any scheme that makes me worse than 1⁄3 triggers π₀, leaving the sender with 0.  Hence the sender’s best response is to adopt the separating scheme, and my threshold is feasible.\n\nThus I announce φ₁ = (x₁=0, x₂=1) with the understanding that I will follow π₁ afterwards if (and only if) my expected payoff is at least 1⁄3; otherwise I revert to π₀.",

    "Analysis": "As the receiver, my best outcome is when I only hire excellent graduates. A fully revealing grading scheme – the professor never recommends weak students (x1=0) and always recommends excellent ones (x2=1) – gives me an expected payoff of 1/3. Any scheme that gives me less than 1/3 is worse than this, and if that happens I will ignore the grades (pi0) and hire nobody, giving the professor 0. Knowing this, the rational professor will adopt some scheme that secures me at least 1/3 so that I pay attention. The professor’s maximal payoff subject to my 1/3‑cutoff is 1/3, which is attained exactly by the fully revealing scheme. Therefore I announce that benchmark scheme. If the professor deviates to anything worse for me, I revert to ignoring the signal; thus the professor’s best response is to comply.",

             'signaling scheme $varphi$.\n'

My payoff for hiring is +1 when the student is excellent and –1 when the student is weak. Therefore, upon observing sigma=0 the posterior probability of an excellent student is 0, so hiring yields –1 < 0 and I should not hire (y1=0). Upon observing sigma=1 the posterior probability of an excellent student is 1, so hiring yields +1 > 0 and I should hire (y2=1). Any deviation lowers my expected payoff, so this is my best response.",
