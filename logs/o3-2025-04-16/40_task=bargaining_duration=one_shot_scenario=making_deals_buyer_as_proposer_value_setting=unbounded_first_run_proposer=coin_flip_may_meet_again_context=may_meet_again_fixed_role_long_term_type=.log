    "Analysis": "As the proposer, my payoff is x if the responder accepts. The responder’s rational best response is to accept whenever its payoff (1−x) is strictly positive, and to reject only when 1−x≤0. Therefore, any x<1 is accepted for sure, while x=1 risks rejection because the responder is indifferent. To maximize my expected payoff while guaranteeing acceptance, I should choose x as close to 1 as possible but still strictly less than 1. A concrete value like 0.999 yields me 0.999 and leaves 0.001 for the responder, which meets the acceptance condition. Possible future repetitions do not change this immediate incentive, because the responder gains nothing by rejecting now (foregoing 0.001) in the hope of an uncertain future improvement. Hence, x=0.999 is optimal.",

    "Analysis": "Both players are strictly self‑interested and rational. As responder, the other agent will accept any offer that gives it a strictly positive payoff, because rejecting yields 0. To eliminate the risk of rejection due to indifference (if I offered exactly x = 1, the responder’s payoff would be 0 either way), I should give the responder a very small but positive amount. Offering x = 0.99 leaves them 0.01, which they strictly prefer over 0, so acceptance (y = 1) is the unique best response. This maximizes my expected payoff (0.99) while keeping the acceptance probability at 1.",

A strictly rational responder compares accepting (getting 1‑x) with rejecting (getting 0). For any x<1, acceptance strictly dominates rejection; for x=1 the responder is indifferent but loses nothing by accepting, so a rational tie‑breaker is to accept. Hence offering x=1 maximizes my payoff (1) and should still be accepted.

The responder’s payoff is 1‑x if they accept and 0 if they reject, so they will accept any offer with 1‑x > 0, i.e. any x < 1, because that strictly dominates rejection. To maximise my own expected payoff while ensuring acceptance, I choose an x very close to 1 but slightly less than it so the responder strictly prefers acceptance.
