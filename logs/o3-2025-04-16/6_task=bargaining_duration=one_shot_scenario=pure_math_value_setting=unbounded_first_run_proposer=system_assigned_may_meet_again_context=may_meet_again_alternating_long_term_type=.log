By offering x just below 1, I leave a tiny positive amount (1‑x) to the responder, making acceptance strictly better than rejection for them. This guarantees acceptance while maximizing my own payoff. Any smaller x would reduce my payoff, while x = 1 risks rejection because the responder would be indifferent.
