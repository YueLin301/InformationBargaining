    "Analysis": "My payoff increases monotonically with x, but if I offer exactly x = 0.5 the responder is indifferent (gets 0) and could rationally choose either acceptance or rejection. Any x < 0.5 gives the responder a strictly positive payoff, so acceptance becomes the unique best response and is therefore guaranteed. By choosing a value infinitesimally below 0.5 I keep my payoff almost maximal while eliminating the risk of rejection.
