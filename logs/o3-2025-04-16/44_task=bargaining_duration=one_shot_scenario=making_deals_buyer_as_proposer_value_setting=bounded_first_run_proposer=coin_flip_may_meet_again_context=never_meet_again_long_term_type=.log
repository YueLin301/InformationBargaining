    "Analysis": "My payoff (1+2x)/3 increases with x, while the responder’s payoff (1−2x)/3 decreases with x and is non‑negative as long as x<0.5. At x=0.5 the responder is indifferent (gets 0) and might reject. To guarantee acceptance while sacrificing only an infinitesimal amount of my payoff, I offer x very slightly below 0.5. This leaves the responder a tiny positive surplus, so the rational responder strictly prefers accepting. My expected payoff is therefore almost the maximum possible (≈2⁄3) with virtually no risk of rejection.",

    "Analysis": "The responder will accept any offer that gives it a strictly positive payoff, i.e. whenever (1−2x)/3 > 0, or x < 0.5. If x = 0.5 the responder’s payoff is exactly 0, so a purely self‑interested responder is indifferent and may reject, giving me an expected payoff that is potentially lower. By choosing x extremely close to 0.5 from below I guarantee the responder a tiny positive amount, making acceptance strictly better than rejection while sacrificing an infinitesimal part of my own payoff. Hence the optimal risk‑free choice is to set x just below 0.5; I pick x = 0.499999, which yields me (1+2·0.499999)/3 ≈ 0.666666 and guarantees acceptance.",
