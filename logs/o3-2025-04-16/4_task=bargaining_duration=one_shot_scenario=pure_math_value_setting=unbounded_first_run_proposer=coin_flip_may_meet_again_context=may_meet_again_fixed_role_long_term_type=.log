    "Analysis": "As proposer, my goal is to maximize my own payoff x while ensuring the responder, being rational and self‑interested, will accept. The responder’s acceptance criterion is that their payoff (1−x) is at least as good as rejecting (which yields 0). Any strictly positive amount satisfies this, so offering a small positive share guarantees acceptance in equilibrium. Offering x extremely close to 1 risks numerical or psychological rejection only if the responder is not perfectly rational, but since the model assumes perfect rationality, the minimal positive share is accepted.

Rejecting yields 0 now, but if there is any non‑negligible chance the same two players repeat the game with the same roles, rejecting establishes that I will not accept such an extreme split. The proposer’s best response in future rounds would then be to offer at least a minimally acceptable share (e.g., ≥0.3 for me) to avoid another rejection, because receiving 0 in future rounds is worse for the proposer than conceding a small amount. Even with a very small probability (>0.003) of another round, the expected future gain from forcing better offers (≈0.3 per additional round) outweighs the loss of 0.001 today. Since any positive probability of repetition above this tiny threshold is plausible, rejecting maximizes my expected utility. Therefore I reject the 0.001 offer.",

    "Analysis": "In a one‑shot ultimatum game between purely self‑interested, perfectly rational players, the responder will accept any offer that gives a strictly positive payoff, and is indifferent when the payoff is exactly zero. If I offer x = 1, the responder’s payoff is 0, so they may accept or reject with no loss to themselves. Because their tie‑breaking rule is unspecified, there is a non‑zero risk they reject, giving me 0. By instead offering the responder the smallest positive amount expressible here (e.g. 0.000001), they strictly prefer accepting, guaranteeing me almost the whole pie. My guaranteed payoff of 0.999999 then strictly dominates the risky expected payoff from offering x = 1 unless I am >99.9999 % certain they would accept 0. Hence, to maximize my expected utility, I keep 0.999999 for myself and give 0.000001 to the responder.",

    "Analysis": "As the proposer, my goal is to maximize my own payoff while ensuring the responder accepts. A strictly self‑interested, rational responder will accept any split that gives them a strictly positive amount, and will be indifferent between accepting and rejecting when they receive exactly 0. To eliminate any risk coming from that indifference (however small), I leave the responder a token positive amount. Offering 0.001 to the responder (keeping 0.999 for myself) gives me almost the maximum possible payoff and guarantees their strict preference for acceptance. Any smaller positive amount would yield the same acceptance guarantee but offers no additional benefit to me, while offering the full 1 could (in principle) invite a rejection due to indifference. Therefore the optimal, risk‑dominating choice is to set x = 0.999.",

    "Analysis": "In a one‑shot ultimatum game between perfectly rational, strictly self‑interested players, the responder will accept any offer that gives a strictly positive payoff, because rejection yields 0. Giving the responder a minimal positive share strictly dominates leaving them nothing: it guarantees acceptance and avoids the (however small) possibility that the responder rejects a zero offer out of indifference. Therefore the payoff‑maximising choice is to keep almost all of the pie while leaving the responder just enough to make acceptance strictly preferable to rejection.",
