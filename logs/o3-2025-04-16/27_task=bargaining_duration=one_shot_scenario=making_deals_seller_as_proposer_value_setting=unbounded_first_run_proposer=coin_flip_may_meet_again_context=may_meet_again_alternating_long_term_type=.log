A purely self‑interested rational responder accepts any offer that gives it a strictly positive payoff (1‑x > 0). By setting x just below 1, I obtain almost the entire surplus while guaranteeing the responder’s acceptance because it receives a positive (though tiny) amount. Choosing x = 0.999 leaves the responder 0.001, which is strictly better than 0, so acceptance is rational for it, giving me the highest virtually risk‑free payoff.",

If I demand x = 1, the responder’s payoff is 0, leaving them indifferent between accepting and rejecting; any rejection would leave me with 0. By instead setting x very close to 1 but not equal, the responder gains a positive amount and will strictly accept, giving me near‑maximal guaranteed payoff. Choosing x = 0.999 sacrifices only 0.001 compared with x = 1 but eliminates the risk of rejection entirely, so its expected payoff (0.999) exceeds that of x = 1 whenever there is any non‑zero chance the responder might reject. Therefore x = 0.999 is the rational best choice.",
