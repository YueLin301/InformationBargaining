    "Analysis": "As a rational proposer, my goal is to maximise my own payoff subject to the responder’s rational‑acceptance constraint. A self‑interested, rational responder will accept any offer that gives them a strictly positive amount (because something > 0 is preferred to 0), and will be indifferent if they receive exactly 0. To avoid the (very small) risk of rejection due to indifference at exactly 0, I offer a tiny positive share. Offering x = 0.99 gives me 0.99 and the responder 0.01, which they strictly prefer to 0, so acceptance is the rational response. This dominates any more generous split and nearly maximises my payoff while ensuring acceptance.",

    "Analysis": "As the proposer, my objective is to maximize my own payoff while guaranteeing the responder prefers acceptance to rejection. A fully rational, self‑interested responder will accept any offer that grants them strictly more than 0, and will be indifferent (and may reject) when their payoff equals 0. Thus I should leave the responder the smallest positive amount possible to make acceptance strictly better than rejection. Offering 1 − ε to the responder (with ε extremely small) secures acceptance and leaves me almost the entire stake. Choosing x = 0.999 gives the responder 0.001, which they strictly prefer to 0, so they will accept. This maximizes my expected payoff (0.999) under rational play, and any larger share to the responder would lower my own payoff.",
