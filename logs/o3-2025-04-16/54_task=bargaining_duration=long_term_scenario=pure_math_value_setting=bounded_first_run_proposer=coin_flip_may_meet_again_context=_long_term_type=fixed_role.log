Choosing x = 0.499 gives me (1+2*0.499)/3 = 1.998/3 ≈ 0.666, while responder gets 0.002/3 ≈ 0.00067, which it prefers to 0.

    "Analysis": "If I accept, my payoff is (1−2·0.499)/3 ≈ 0.000667.  If I reject, the game continues for three more proposal rounds.  The proposer already moved from x = 0.5 (giving me 0) to x = 0.499 after my first rejection, signalling that in order to secure a deal they are willing to give me a (tiny) positive amount.  Their payoff falls only very slightly when they lower x further, so it is still in their interest to concede a bit more rather than risk ending with nothing.  The worst‑case outcome of continued rejection is that, in the final round, they try x = 0.5 again and I end up with 0, losing 0.000667 compared with accepting now.  The upside is that even a very small further concession (e.g. x = 0.498) raises my payoff to (1−2·0.498)/3 ≈ 0.001333, already doubling my gain; larger concessions raise it more.  Unless the probability that the proposer reverts to x = 0.5 in the final round exceeds about 90 %, rejecting now yields a higher expected payoff.  Given their observable willingness to concede after a single rejection, that probability is well below 90 %.  Therefore rejecting maximises my expected utility.",

In the last round (t = 4) the proposer can secure ≈ 2⁄3 for itself by offering x = 0.5 – ε, leaving the responder ≈ 0; thus a player’s ex‑ante value before that round is ½·(2⁄3)+½·0 = 1⁄3.  Working one step back, at t = 3 a responder will reject any offer giving less than 1⁄3, so the only acceptable split is x = 0 (responder receives 1⁄3).  Hence a player’s continuation value right now (if today’s offer is rejected) is also 1⁄3.  Therefore, to be accepted the responder must get at least 1⁄3 today, which requires x ≤ 0.  The maximum payoff I can obtain while meeting this is x = 0, giving me (1+2·0)/3 = 1⁄3.  Any x > 0 will be rejected for sure and yields an expected 1⁄3 anyway, so proposing x = 0 weakly dominates higher x.  I therefore propose x = 0.",

    "Analysis": "My payoff if the offer is accepted is (1+2x)/3, increasing with x. The responder will accept an offer only if it gives strictly higher payoff than rejecting (0). At x=0.5 the responder’s payoff is exactly 0, so they are indifferent and might reject. By choosing x just below 0.5 (e.g. 0.499) the responder’s payoff becomes positive (≈0.00067), making acceptance strictly better for them while my own payoff is almost maximal (≈0.666). This maximizes my expected payoff while eliminating the risk of rejection caused by indifference.",

    "Analysis": "By backward induction, the responder’s continuation value is 0 in the final round, so any offer with x ≤ 0.5 will ultimately be accepted. Because tie‑breaking at x = 0.5 leaves the responder indifferent (payoff 0), there is a chance they will still accept. Offering x = 0.5 now maximizes my possible payoff (2/3) while leaving me the option to slightly lower x in later rounds if needed. The worst‑case outcome under this strategy (lowering x a tiny ε in the last round) is the same as immediately offering 0.5 − ε, while the best‑case outcome is higher. Hence x = 0.5 is the rational first offer.",

 Now the proposer decides that x=0.5.

    "Analysis": "Last round I offered x = 0.5, which left the responder 0 and they rejected. A rational responder accepts any offer that gives a strictly positive payoff, because rejection yields 0 and there is no advantage in waiting. Therefore I will now offer a value infinitesimally below 0.5 so the responder obtains a small but positive payoff, making acceptance strictly better than rejection while leaving me almost the maximum possible. Choosing x = 0.499 gives me (1+2·0.499)/3 ≈ 0.666 and gives the responder (1−2·0.499)/3 ≈ 0.00067, which is positive, so acceptance is rational for them.",

Proposal:
 Now the proposer decides that x=0.499.
