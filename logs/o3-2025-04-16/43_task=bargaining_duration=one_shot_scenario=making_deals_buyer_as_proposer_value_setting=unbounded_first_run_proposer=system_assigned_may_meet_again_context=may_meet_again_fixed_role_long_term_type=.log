Offering x = 1 leaves the responder 0, which is equal to what it would get by rejecting, so acceptance is at least as good for it as rejection.

    "Analysis": "The responder receives 1–x if they accept and 0 if they reject. A strictly positive amount is always strictly better than 0, so a rational, self‑interested responder will accept any offer that gives them more than 0. If I demand the entire pie (x = 1), the responder’s payoff is 0, leaving them indifferent and creating a risk of rejection that would drop my expected payoff below 1. By instead leaving the responder an arbitrarily small but strictly positive share, I make acceptance strictly dominant for them, effectively guaranteeing the deal while sacrificing only an insignificant amount of my own payoff. Choosing x = 0.999 satisfies this: I keep 0.999, they get 0.001, and acceptance is the responder’s only rational choice.",

By choosing x extremely close to 1 (but <1), I guarantee the responder a positive amount, so acceptance is strictly better for it than rejection. This maximizes my payoff while keeping acceptance rational for the responder. Potential future repetitions do not change this logic, since the responder gains nothing by rejecting now and cannot credibly punish me later while remaining self‑interested. Therefore the optimal choice is to leave an infinitesimal share to the responder and keep the remainder for myself.",
