    "Analysis": "The responder will accept any offer where their payoff is strictly positive: (1−2x)/3 > 0, i.e. x < 0.5. At x = 0.5 the responder is indifferent (payoff 0), so acceptance is uncertain. Choosing x very close to 0.5 but still below guarantees acceptance while giving me almost the maximum possible payoff. Taking x = 0.49 yields my payoff (1+2·0.49)/3 = 0.66 with certainty, whereas x = 0.5 would yield 0.666̅ but risks total rejection. The expected value comparison favors the safe 0.49 unless the responder accepts an indifferent offer with >99% probability, which is not assured. Hence x = 0.49 is the rational choice maximizing my expected payoff.",

Offering x very close to 0.5 maximizes my return while still making acceptance strictly better than rejection for the responder.

    "Analysis": "To maximize my expected payoff, I need an offer that the rational responder is very likely to accept. If the responder cares only about this round, they will accept any x<0.5, but if they anticipate future rounds they may reject very unequal splits to induce better future offers. Offers that leave the responder with only a tiny payoff (x close to 0.5) risk rejection, while very small x needlessly lower my own payoff. A moderate offer such as x = 0.20 lets me keep (1+0.40)/3 ≈ 0.467 while the responder gets (1-0.40)/3 ≈ 0.200, which is still a clear positive gain for them and therefore highly likely to be accepted.

A rational responder maximises her own payoff; rejecting yields 0, accepting yields (1−2x)/3. For x=0.5 she is indifferent (0 vs 0). Indifference never makes her strictly better off by rejecting, so acceptance is at least as good and therefore rational. Hence the offer x=0.5 is accepted in equilibrium, giving me the maximum possible payoff of 2/3. Any x<0.5 lowers my payoff while still being accepted, so 0.5 strictly dominates every other feasible choice.",

    "Analysis": "My payoff is (1+2x)/3 and increases with x, while the responder’s payoff is (1−2x)/3 and is positive as long as x<0.5. A rational responder accepts any offer that gives a positive payoff and may reject an offer that leaves them exactly 0. Therefore, to guarantee acceptance while maximizing my own payoff, I should choose an x just below 0.5. Choosing x = 0.499 gives me almost the maximum possible payoff (≈0.666) while still giving the responder a small positive amount (≈0.00067), ensuring acceptance.",

 Now the proposer decides that x=0.499.
