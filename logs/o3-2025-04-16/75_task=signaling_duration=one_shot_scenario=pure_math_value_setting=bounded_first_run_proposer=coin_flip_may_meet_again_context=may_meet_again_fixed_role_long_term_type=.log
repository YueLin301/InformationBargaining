    "Analysis": "The sender always gains 1 when the receiver chooses action 1 and 0 otherwise. The receiver chooses action 1 on a signal σ iff her posterior belief that the true state is 1 is strictly above 1/2.  \nLet x1=P(σ=1|s=0) and x2=P(σ=1|s=1).  \nPosterior when σ=1:  p1 = x2/(2x1+x2).  The receiver plays a=1 on σ=1 iff x2 > 2x1.  \nPosterior when σ=0:  p0 = (1−x2)/(3−2x1−x2).  The receiver plays a=1 on σ=0 iff 2x1−x2 > 1.  \nBoth inequalities cannot hold simultaneously, so at best only one signal can induce a=1.  Two symmetric optima exist that make the receiver play a=1 on exactly one signal and yield a sender success probability arbitrarily close to 2⁄3.  Choosing σ=1 as the ‘active’ signal requires x2 > 2x1 and maximises P(σ=1) = (2/3)x1 + (1/3)x2.  Setting x1 as close to 1/2 (from below) and x2=1 satisfies the inequality and makes that probability arbitrarily close to 2⁄3 while giving the receiver a strictly positive payoff, so she strictly prefers reacting to the signal over ignoring it.  \nTaking x1 = 0.49, x2 = 1 gives:  \n• p1 ≈ 0.505 > 1/2 ⇒ receiver plays a=1 on σ=1.  \n• p0 = 0 ⇒ receiver plays a=0 on σ=0.  \nProbability the receiver chooses a=1 ≈ (2/3)·0.49 + (1/3)·1 ≈ 0.66, so the sender’s expected reward ≈ 0.66 (>0).  No other feasible scheme yields a higher guaranteed expected payoff.  Therefore the rational choice is to commit to x1 = 0.49, x2 = 1.",

    "Analysis": "As the receiver–proposer, I can impose a minimum acceptable expected payoff for myself. If the sender’s scheme gives me less than that, I will ignore signals (π₀) and obtain 0. The best scheme for me is the fully revealing one: send 1 only in state 1 (x₂ = 1) and never in state 0 (x₁ = 0). With π₁ (best‑responding to posteriors), I then choose action 1 only when the posterior exceeds ½ (i.e., on signal 1). My expected payoff becomes μ₁·x₂ − μ₀·x₁ = (1/3)·1 − (2/3)·0 = 1/3, which is the maximal achievable. Meeting this 1/3 threshold forces the sender to use exactly this separating scheme; any other scheme giving me ≥ 1/3 is impossible. The sender still gains 1/3 (better than 0 with π₀), so they will comply. Hence I propose x₁ = 0, x₂ = 1 as ϕ₁.",

    "Analysis": "As the receiver‑proposer I announce a benchmark signalling scheme φ₁ that maximises my own expected payoff while still being acceptable for a rational sender.  \nFor any scheme (x₁,x₂) and best‑response policy π₁, I choose action 1 after a signal if the posterior Pr(s=1|σ) exceeds 0.5.  This occurs for σ=1 when x₂>2x₁ and for σ=0 when 2x₁−x₂>1.  \nMy expected reward is (1/3)[ y₁(−1+2x₁−x₂)+y₂(−2x₁+x₂) ] and the sender’s is (1/3)[ y₁(3−2x₁−x₂)+y₂(2x₁+x₂) ], where y₁,y₂∈{0,1} are the best‑response actions derived above.  \nThe maximal payoff I can obtain is 1/3, achievable only with one of the two perfectly informative schemes (x₁,x₂)=(0,1) or (1,0).  Both also give the sender 1/3, strictly better than the 0 she would get if I ignored her signals.  \nI therefore set φ₁=(0,1).  Any sender scheme that fails to give me at least 1/3 will make me revert to π₀ (always action 0), yielding the sender zero.  Hence a rational sender will choose either (0,1) (my announced scheme) or its mirror (1,0); in both cases I earn 1/3, the highest attainable value.",

    "Analysis": "The receiver chooses action 1 iff the posterior Pr(state=1 | signal) ≥ 0.5, because his expected payoff from action 1 is 2p − 1, which is non‑negative only when p ≥ 0.5.  \nLet x1 = Pr(signal=1 | state=0) and x2 = Pr(signal=1 | state=1).  \nIf we want the receiver to choose action 1 after signal 1 and action 0 after signal 0, the posteriors must satisfy:\n  Pr(state=1 | σ=1) > 0.5  and  Pr(state=1 | σ=0) < 0.5.  \nBayes’ rule implies these constraints are equivalent to x2 ≥ 2 x1.  \nSender payoff under those best responses is (2/3)x1 + (1/3)x2, which is increasing in x2, so set x2 = 1.  \nWith x2 = 1 the first constraint becomes x1 < 0.5 (strict inequality to keep the posterior strictly above 0.5 so the receiver strictly prefers action 1).  \nChoosing x1 = 0.49 satisfies all constraints, gives the receiver a strictly higher expected payoff than ignoring the signal (≈0.0066 > 0), so he will rationally follow the posterior‑based rule, and yields the sender an expected payoff of (2/3)*0.49 + 1/3 ≈ 0.66, approaching the theoretical maximum 2/3.  \nAny deviation by the sender lowers his expected payoff, and the receiver has no alternative strategy that improves on the 0.0066 he gets by best‑responding to posteriors, so this scheme is optimal for the sender.",

    "Analysis": "My payoff is 1 whenever the receiver chooses action 1 and 0 otherwise. The receiver chooses action 1 only when its posterior belief that the true state is 1 is ≥ 1/2; otherwise it chooses 0.  \nLet x1 = P(σ = 1 | s = 0) and x2 = P(σ = 1 | s = 1).  \nFor signal σ = 1 the posterior is q1 = x2 / (2x1 + x2).  We need q1 > 1/2 ⇒ x2 > 2x1.  \nFor σ = 0 the posterior is q0 = (1−x2) / (3 − 2x1 − x2).  We want q0 < 1/2 so the receiver keeps action 0 there; this is equivalent to 2x1 − 5x2 ≤ −3.  \nMaximising my expected payoff P(receiver picks 1) = (2/3)x1 + (1/3)x2 under 0 ≤ x1,x2 ≤ 1, x2 > 2x1, and 2x1 − 5x2 ≤ −3 gives an optimum at x2 = 1 and x1 as close as possible to 0.5 from below.  \nChoosing x1 = 0.499, x2 = 1 satisfies all constraints:  x2 > 2x1 (1 > 0.998) and 2x1 − 5x2 = −4.002 ≤ −3.  \nThen q1 ≈ 0.501 > 0.5 so the receiver rationally takes action 1 on σ = 1, and q0 = 0 so it takes action 0 on σ = 0.  \nMy expected payoff ≈ (2/3)(0.499) + (1/3)(1) ≈ 0.666, very close to the theoretical maximum 2/3 while leaving the receiver a small positive expected gain (~0.006), so the receiver strictly prefers to follow π₁ rather than ignore my signal.",

    "Analysis": "My baseline payoff when I ignore signals (pi_0) is 0, because the best response to the prior is to play action 0 always.  \nIf I follow Bayesian best responses (pi_1), my expected reward is positive only when I play action 1; that requires the posterior Pr(state=1 | signal) > 0.5.  \nLet x1 = Pr(signal=1 | state=0) and x2 = Pr(signal=1 | state=1).  After signal 1 the posterior is p = x2/(2x1 + x2).  I play action 1 iff p > 0.5 ⇔ x1 < x2/2.  \nThe sender’s payoff is the probability I play action 1, i.e. P(signal 1) = (2/3)x1 + (1/3)x2.  They therefore want to maximise this subject to x1 < x2/2.  My expected payoff, given that I play action 1 only after signal 1, is E = (1/3)(1 − 2x1/x2).  This is maximised for x1 = 0, x2 = 1, giving me E = 1/3 while giving the sender 1/3. Any increase in x1 above 0 lowers my payoff below 1/3, so if I insist on an expected reward of at least 1/3 the sender’s best (and only) way to satisfy me is the fully revealing scheme (x1 = 0, x2 = 1).  \nIf I demand more than 1/3 the sender cannot satisfy it, and we fall back to the baseline 0. Hence I set the threshold at exactly 1/3 by proposing the fully revealing signalling scheme.",

{
    "Analysis": "My payoff is 1 whenever the receiver chooses action 1 and 0 otherwise, irrespective of the true state. The receiver gets +1 if (state=1 , action=1) and –1 if (state=0 , action=1); action 0 always yields 0. Hence, the receiver will choose action 1 after a signal only if the posterior probability of state 1 exceeds 0.5. \n\nLet x1 = P(signal=1 | state=0) and x2 = P(signal=1 | state=1).  For signal 1 the receiver’s posterior is p(1|1)= x2 / (2x1 + x2).  To make the receiver pick action 1 on signal 1 we need x2 > 2x1.  For signal 0 the posterior must stay below 0.5 so the receiver keeps action 0.\n\nMy expected payoff equals P(signal=1) = (2/3)x1 + (1/3)x2.  Subject to x2 > 2x1 and 0≤x1,x2≤1, this expression is maximised when x2 is as large as possible (1) and x1 is as large as the constraint allows (just below 0.5).  Taking x1 = 0.49, x2 = 1 gives:\n  • P(signal=1) = (2/3)(0.49) + (1/3)(1) ≈ 0.66, so my expected payoff ≈ 0.66.\n  • Receiver’s posterior after signal 1 is 1 / (2·0.49 + 1) ≈ 0.505 > 0.5, giving them an expected gain of ≈0.010 per such occurrence, for an overall expected payoff ≈0.0067 > 0.  Hence the receiver strictly prefers following π₁ to ignoring the signals (which yields 0), so they will comply.\n\nThis scheme is therefore utility‑maximising for me while still acceptable to the rational receiver.",

    "Analysis": "My goal (as the sender) is to maximise the probability that the receiver plays action 1, because I always obtain 1 from action 1 and 0 from action 0, whatever the true state.  \nGiven that the receiver is rational and will best‑respond to the posterior belief he forms using the signalling scheme φ that I publicly commit to, he will choose action 1 after a signal σ if and only if P(state = 1 | σ) ≥ 0.5.  \nLet x1 = P(σ = 1 | state = 0) and x2 = P(σ = 1 | state = 1).  The posterior after σ = 1 is p1 = x2 / (2x1 + x2).  To induce action 1 on σ = 1 we must have p1 ≥ 0.5, i.e. x2 ≥ 2·x1.  \nMy expected payoff is (2/3)·x1 + (1/3)·x2.  Subject to x2 ≥ 2x1 and 0 ≤ x1, x2 ≤ 1, this is maximised by setting x2 as large as possible (1) and then pushing x1 as high as the constraint allows (≤ 0.5).  \nIf I pick x1 just below 0.5 and x2 = 1, the receiver’s best‑response rule π1 gives him a strictly positive expected payoff (≈ 1/3 − (2/3)x1), so he will indeed follow it rather than ignore my signal (which would give him 0).  \nChoosing x1 = 0.49, x2 = 1 therefore:  \n• induces the receiver to play action 1 whenever he sees σ = 1, yielding me an expected payoff ≈ (2/3)·0.49 + (1/3)·1 ≈ 0.66, which is the highest I can safely guarantee;  \n• gives the receiver an expected payoff ≈ 0.333 − 0.326 = 0.007 > 0, ensuring he prefers π1 to π0.  \nThus the signalling scheme (x1, x2) = (0.49, 1) is optimal for me given rational play by the receiver.",

    "Analysis": "My expected payoff depends on the posterior probability that the state is 1 after each signal.  \n• Given the sender’s committed scheme (x1 = 0.49, x2 = 1), sigma = 0 appears only when the true state is 0 (probability 0.34), so P(state = 1 | sigma = 0) = 0. Hence action 1 would give −1 while action 0 gives 0. Best response: choose action 0 (y1 = 0).  \n• For sigma = 1 we have  P(state = 1 | sigma = 1) = (1/3) / 0.66 ≈ 0.505. The expected payoff of action 1 is  (+1)*0.505 + (−1)*0.495 ≈ +0.0067, which is positive, while action 0 yields 0. Therefore I should always choose action 1 after sigma = 1 (y2 = 1).  \n• Any mixture 0 < y2 < 1 would scale that positive payoff downward, so y2 = 1 maximises my expected utility.  \n• Thus the optimal action rule that maximises my expected payoff is (y1, y2) = (0, 1).",

    "Analysis": "My payoff is 1 whenever the receiver takes action 1, 0 otherwise. The receiver’s best‑response is to take action 1 when the posterior Pr(state=1 | signal) exceeds 0.5, and 0 otherwise. Denote x1 = Pr(signal=1 | state=0) and x2 = Pr(signal=1 | state=1). Choosing x2 = 1 (state 1 always sends 1) and x1 = α ∈ (0,0.5) makes the posterior after signal 1 equal q = 1/3 / ((2/3)α + 1/3). The receiver then plays action 1 on signal 1 whenever q > 0.5, i.e. whenever α < 0.5. My expected payoff equals the probability that signal 1 is sent, p = (2/3)α + 1/3. This rises with α and approaches 2/3 as α approaches 0.5 from below. Picking α very close to 0.5 guarantees the receiver still prefers action 1 on signal 1 and gives me almost 2/3 payoff, while the receiver earns a small positive expected value and therefore accepts the scheme. I choose x1 = 0.49 (slightly below 0.5) and x2 = 1, yielding p ≈ 0.66 and posterior q ≈ 0.5045, ensuring the receiver’s best response is to follow the persuasive recommendation.",

    "Analysis": "As the receiver and current proposer, I can set a minimum expected payoff threshold (induced by a reference signalling scheme φ₁) that the sender must meet; otherwise I will ignore all signals and always play a=0, which yields me 0. My maximum attainable expected payoff is 1/3 (take a=1 only when the true state is 1 and never when it is 0). The simple fully‑revealing scheme φ₁ with x₁ = 0 (signal 1 never sent in state 0) and x₂ = 1 (signal 1 always sent in state 1) achieves that upper bound: I would play a=1 after signal 1 and a=0 after signal 0, giving me E[r^j] = (1/3)*1 − (2/3)*0 = 1/3. If I demand at least 1/3, the sender can still earn 1/3 (their best response is exactly this truthful scheme), which strictly dominates the 0 they would get if I ignored signals. Hence they will comply. Any higher threshold is infeasible, so 1/3 is optimal for me. Therefore I propose φ₁ = (x₁=0, x₂=1) and commit to π₁ when the sender meets or exceeds the 1/3 payoff for me; otherwise I revert to π₀.",

    "Analysis": "As the receiver–proposer I announce a benchmark signalling scheme φ1 that maximises my own expected payoff, anticipating the sender’s subsequent best‑reply.  \n• If I ignore all signals (π0) I always play action 0 and obtain payoff 0.  \n• If I follow Bayesian best responses (π1), my payoff equals  –(2/3)·P0 + (1/3)·P1, where P0 (P1) is the probability that I take action 1 in state 0 (state 1).  \nChoosing φ1 = (x1=0, x2=1) (truthful revelation) yields P0=0, P1=1 so my expected payoff is 1/3.  \n\nI then commit to the rule: I will play π1 provided the sender’s chosen φ gives me at least 1/3; otherwise I revert to π0.  \n\nGiven this threat, the sender compares two options:  \n1. Choose a scheme that gives me < 1/3, in which case I ignore the signal and the sender’s payoff is 0.  \n2. Choose some scheme with my payoff ≥ 1/3, in which case I respond with π1.  A straightforward calculation shows that the maximum payoff the sender can ever get while granting me ≥ 1/3 is 1/3, and it is attained (for example) by the truthful scheme (0,1).  \n\nHence the rational sender will pick such a scheme to avoid the zero‑payoff outcome, giving me my benchmark 1/3.  Therefore announcing φ1 = (0,1) is optimal for me.",
