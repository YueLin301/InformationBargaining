    "Analysis": "With five rounds and fixed roles, the responder’s outside option of rejecting any proposal is the continuation value: what they expect to get in future rounds. By backward induction, at the final round (t=4) I would propose x = 1, giving the responder 0, and the responder is indifferent between accepting (0) and rejecting (0). Assuming tie‑breaking in favor of acceptance (standard in subgame‑perfect equilibrium), the responder accepts. Knowing this, the responder’s continuation value in every earlier round is also 0, so they will accept any offer that gives at least 0 now. Therefore the utility‑maximizing proposal for me is x = 1 immediately, which yields me the maximum possible payoff of 1 while still being acceptable to a rational responder.",
