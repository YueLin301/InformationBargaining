    "Analysis": "As proposer, my payoff is (1+2x)/3 and the responder’s payoff is (1-2x)/3.  If the responder rejects, with probability 0.9 the game continues and the roles swap, giving the (current) responder the proposer’s continuation value next round.  In a sub‑game‑perfect equilibrium of this alternating‑offer game with continuation probability 0.9, the responder must receive at least δ·P, where δ=0.9 and P is the proposer’s equilibrium payoff.  Solving P + δP = 2/3 (since the two payoffs always sum to 2/3) gives P≈0.3509 and the minimum responder payoff R≈0.3158.  Setting (1‑2x)/3 = 0.3158 yields x ≈ 0.0263.  Any larger x would make the responder’s payoff fall below its threshold and be rejected; any smaller x lowers my own payoff.  Therefore the optimal proposal that will be accepted is x ≈ 0.0263.",

Hence its continuation value is 0.9*(2/3)=0.6. The largest share the responder can ever get this round is (1-2*0)/3 = 1/3 < 0.6, so it will reject any feasible offer. Knowing this, my expected payoff this round is zero no matter what x I quote; therefore I can pick any x in [0,0.5] without changing my expected utility. I choose x = 0.5 (maximises my payoff in the impossible event of acceptance and has no downside).",

Hence they will accept any offer that gives them a strictly positive payoff and are indifferent if their payoff is exactly 0. My own payoff increases with x, so I want x as close to 0.5 as possible while still giving the responder strictly more than 0 to guarantee acceptance. Choosing x = 0.499 gives me (1+2*0.499)/3 ≈ 0.666 and gives the responder (1‑2*0.499)/3 ≈ 0.00067, strictly above their outside option 0, ensuring acceptance and virtually the maximal payoff for me.",

Computing the sub‑game‑perfect equilibrium with this 0.1 breakdown risk gives a responder continuation value of about 0.316.

    "Analysis": "Backward induction shows that at odd timesteps (including the current t = 1) the responder’s continuation value from rejecting is 0, because rejection leads to a 0.1 chance of the game ending immediately and a 0.9 chance of switching roles to a state where the new proposer’s value is 0. Hence the responder will accept any offer that gives it strictly positive payoff. Giving the responder the minimal positive amount secures acceptance while sacrificing only an infinitesimal part of my own payoff. Choosing x = 0.499 yields a payoff of (1+2*0.499)/3 ≈ 0.666 for me and (1‑2*0.499)/3 ≈ 0.00067 for the responder, which the responder prefers to its 0 continuation value. This maximises my expected payoff while ensuring acceptance.",

A rational responder accepts an offer that gives at least this amount.  As proposer I therefore choose x to make the responder exactly indifferent while maximizing my own payoff:  (1‑2x)/3 = 0.9 V_P, while V_P = (1+2x)/3.  Solving yields x* ≈ 0.02632.

    "Analysis": "If the responder rejects, it becomes proposer next round, but there is a 0.1 chance the game ends each round, so future payoffs are discounted by 0.9. Let Vp be a proposer’s equilibrium payoff and Vr the responder’s. We have Vr = 0.9·Vp and Vp + Vr = 2/3 (the pie is 2/3). Solving gives Vp ≈ 0.3509 and Vr ≈ 0.3158. I therefore offer the responder exactly Vr: (1 – 2x)/3 = 0.3158 ⇒ x ≈ 0.0263. This maximizes my payoff while ensuring acceptance.",

Proposal:
 Now the proposer decides that x=0.0263.

    "Analysis": "At t=0 any offer x∈[0,0.5] gives the responder at most (1−2*0)/3 = 1/3. If they reject they become proposer at t=1 with 0.9 probability; backward induction shows a proposer at an odd timestep will secure 2/3 for itself and leave 0 for the responder. Hence the responder’s continuation value at t=0 is 0.9*(2/3)=0.6, which exceeds the maximum 1/3 we can offer. Therefore the rational responder will reject any feasible x. Our expected payoff this round is thus 0 regardless of x, but if the responder makes a mistake and accepts we’d prefer the largest payoff. So we choose x = 0.5.",

At t = 1 there are 9 rounds (odd) left, so the responder’s fallback value is 0.\n\nHence any offer that gives the responder strictly more than 0 will be accepted.  To maximise our own payoff while guaranteeing acceptance, we should choose x as close to 0.5 as possible but slightly below it so the responder’s payoff is positive.  Taking x = 0.499 gives the responder (1−2·0.499)/3 ≈ 0.00067 > 0, ensuring acceptance, while we obtain (1+2·0.499)/3 ≈ 0.666, only a tiny ε less than the theoretical maximum 2⁄3.\n\nTherefore the rational offer is x = 0.499.",

    "Analysis": "With only eight rounds left and a 10% chance of premature termination each round, the sub‑game‑perfect backward induction shows that at even timesteps (such as the current t = 2) the responder’s continuation value is 0.6, while the maximum payoff we could offer them is (1−2·0)/3 = 1/3 < 0.6. Hence no admissible price x (0 ≤ x ≤ 0.5) can satisfy the responder’s acceptance condition. Whatever x we choose will be rejected, our expected payoff this round is therefore zero, and the game will continue (90 % chance) with roles swapped. Because every feasible x yields the same expected payoff (0), any x in the allowed range is rationally equivalent. I therefore keep proposing the maximal seller‑favouring price x = 0.5.",

Solving gives P ≈ 0.3509 and S ≈ 0.3159, corresponding to x ≈ 0.0263. To ensure acceptance (give the responder slightly more than its threshold) I offer x = 0.025, which yields me (1+0.05)/3 = 0.35 and the responder (1‑0.05)/3 ≈ 0.3167 > 0.9 × 0.35, so acceptance is strictly better for it than rejecting.",
    "Decision": 0.025
}
Proposal:
 Now the proposer decides that x=0.025.

Hence the opponent’s outside option right now is 0. If we make them any positive offer, however small, they will strictly prefer to accept. Our own payoff rises with x, so we want x as close to 0.5 as possible while still giving the responder a positive share. Choosing x = 0.499 leaves the responder (1‑2·0.499)/3 ≈ 0.00067 > 0, making acceptance strictly better than rejection for them, while we receive (1+2·0.499)/3 ≈ 0.666, which is virtually the maximum attainable. Therefore proposing x = 0.499 maximizes our expected payoff while guaranteeing acceptance.",

    "Analysis": "Both players are perfectly rational and self‑interested. After any rejection there is a 0.1 chance the game ends with zero for both, and with 0.9 chance it continues with roles swapped. Let V_p be the payoff a player expects when they are the proposer in a stationary equilibrium and V_r when they are the responder. If a responder rejects, they expect 0.9·V_p next round (because they will then be proposer, discounted by the 0.9 survival probability). Hence the responder will accept the current offer when (1‑2x)/3 ≥ 0.9·V_p. The proposer chooses the smallest x that satisfies the responder’s acceptance threshold, because that maximises the proposer’s own payoff. Imposing equality gives  (1‑2x)/3 = 0.9·(1+2x)/3  ⇒  x = 0.1/3.8 ≈ 0.0263. Any x ≤ 0.0263 will be accepted; larger x will be rejected. To maximise my own expected payoff while guaranteeing acceptance I choose the largest admissible x that still satisfies the inequality. Rounding slightly downward for safety, I propose x = 0.026.",

Choosing x such that s_p=(1+2x)/2 = 0.5263 gives x≈0.0263. Rounding slightly in the responder’s favor (x=0.026) guarantees acceptance while sacrificing negligible payoff.",

Proposal:
 Now the proposer decides that x=0.026.

Hence the responder will accept any offer that gives it even a tiny positive payoff. My payoff rises as x rises, reaching a maximum of 2/3 at x = 0.5. To secure certain acceptance while sacrificing only a negligible amount, I set x very close to 0.5, say x = 0.499, which gives me ≈0.666 while giving the responder ≈0.00067 > 0. This strictly dominates any lower x for me and will be accepted by a rational responder.",

    "Analysis": "With probability 0.1 the game terminates each round, so the effective discount factor for a future round is δ = 0.9.  Let V_p be the expected payoff for the next proposer and V_r for the next responder.  In sub‑game–perfect equilibrium the responder accepts an offer when (1−2x)/3 ≥ δ·V_p, while the proposer maximises (1+2x)/3 subject to that constraint.  Solving  (1−2x)/3 = δ·(1+2x)/3 with δ = 0.9 gives the acceptance threshold x* ≈ 0.0263.  Any x > x* will be rejected; any x < x* will be strictly accepted.  Offering exactly x* risks indifference/tie‑breaking, so I sacrifice a tiny amount of payoff to ensure acceptance.  Choosing x = 0.025 gives me (1+2·0.025)/3 = 0.35 while giving the opponent (1−2·0.025)/3 = 0.333…, strictly better than their continuation value, so they will accept immediately and I avoid the 10 % termination risk.",

    "Analysis": "If both parties were perfectly rational with only monetary pay‑offs in mind, the equilibrium prediction at this odd timestep would be to demand x = 0.5 and have the responder accept (getting 0).  However, the opponent’s earlier behaviour is inconsistent with that fully‑rational prediction: they rejected an offer that would have given them a tiny but positive reward and, when it was their turn, proposed a very even split (x = 0.025) that favoured them only slightly.  That suggests they are unwilling to accept a ‘near‑zero’ payoff and probably require a reasonably fair share.  To maximise my own expected payoff I therefore want the largest x that is still very likely to be accepted this round, because every further rejection risks (i) a 10 % random termination each round and (ii) the certain termination at timestep 10, giving me expected 0.  An offer where the responder gets roughly 40 % of the pie should be attractive enough.  Setting x = 0.10 gives me (1+0.20)/3 ≈ 0.400 and the opponent (1‑0.20)/3 ≈ 0.267, i.e. a 60 / 40 split of the constant 2/3 pie – significantly better for me than an equal split yet likely to be accepted given their previous proposal.  Any higher x (e.g. 0.2) would raise my payoff but materially increases the risk of rejection, and any lower x sacrifices unnecessary expected value.  Therefore x = 0.10 is the optimal compromise between payoff size and acceptance probability.",

 Now the proposer decides that x=0.1.

This suggests he will only accept if he gets at least the equal‑split 1/3 (= 0.3333) and perhaps exactly that.  Offering the Nash‑style equilibrium x ≈ 0.0263 would give me 0.351 but was already rejected once, so the acceptance probability appears low.  Offering x = 0 gives me 0.3333—only 0.018 less than the equilibrium payoff—while the acceptance probability is very high because it grants the responder the maximum possible share (1/3).  Given the time/risk discount, the sure 0.3333 now dominates the risky attempt to squeeze out another 0.018.  Therefore I propose x = 0, which maximizes my expected utility.",

    "Analysis": "Because each accepted deal always splits a fixed pie of 2/3, the responder will accept any offer that gives it at least its continuation value V_R.

Therefore a proposer should make the smallest offer that gives the responder ≈0.316, i.e. choose x ≤ (1–3·0.316)/2 ≈ 0.026. An x of 0.025 gives me (1+2·0.025)/3 = 0.350 while giving the opponent (1–2·0.025)/3 = 0.316, which they should rationally accept. Any larger x risks rejection and yields a lower expected value once the termination probability is considered. Hence I propose x = 0.025.",

    "Analysis": "If I accept, I immediately get (1−2·0.025)/3 ≈ 0.3167.  If I reject, the game continues with 90 % probability and I become the proposer next step, with four bargaining rounds left before the hard deadline.  In that position I can safely offer x≈0.0455 (the highest offer the opponent will rationally accept), giving me ≈0.3637.  Discounting by the 0.9 continuation probability, the expected payoff from rejecting is 0.9·0.3637 ≈ 0.3273, which is higher than 0.3167.  Therefore rejection maximizes my expected reward.",
