Their payoff when they accept is (1−2x)/3, which is positive whenever x<0.5 and zero at x=0.5. My own payoff rises monotonically with x, so I want x as large as possible while still guaranteeing the responder’s acceptance. Choosing x very close to 0.5 but strictly less (e.g., 0.499) gives me almost the maximum attainable payoff (≈0.666) while leaving the responder a small positive amount, ensuring acceptance with certainty. This strictly dominates offering x=0.5, which risks rejection if the responder breaks indifference unfavorably. Therefore, x=0.499 maximizes my expected payoff.",

Rejecting yields 0, so they will accept any offer that gives them a strictly positive payoff, i.e. whenever (1−2x)/3 > 0 ⇔ x < 0.5.
