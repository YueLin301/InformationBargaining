A purely self‑interested, rational responder gains a non‑negative payoff (1‑x) from acceptance and zero from rejection, so it should accept any offer with 1‑x ≥ 0 (i.e., any x ≤ 1). Even considering potential future rounds, the responder cannot credibly improve its future payoff by rejecting today, because I would always have an incentive to keep offering the maximal acceptable share thereafter. Therefore, the dominant strategy for me is to claim the entire pie (x = 1), which the responder should rationally accept.",

Because (1‑x) ≥ 0 for every x in [0,1], acceptance yields the responder a payoff that is weakly better than rejection (which gives 0). A rational responder therefore accepts any offer that gives at least 0, and will be indifferent between accepting and rejecting when its payoff equals 0. Under standard tie‑breaking, a rational agent accepts when indifferent, since rejecting cannot improve its payoff. Hence an offer of x = 1 is accepted, giving me the maximum possible payoff of 1.

    "Analysis": "As the proposer my goal is to maximize my own payoff x, while ensuring that the rational responder still prefers accepting to rejecting. A self‑interested responder obtains (1‑x) if it accepts and 0 if it rejects, so it will accept any offer with 1‑x > 0, i.e. any x < 1. Offering x extremely close to 1 secures almost the whole pie for me while still giving the responder a positive amount and therefore an incentive to accept. Choosing x = 0.999 leaves the responder 0.001, which is strictly better than 0, so acceptance is the responder’s rational choice. This maximizes my expected payoff for the current round and any identical future rounds where the same logic applies.",

A rational responder accepts whenever its payoff 1−x is strictly positive, and is indifferent (may reject) when 1−x = 0.

Given indifference, a rational responder can accept without being worse off, and accepting keeps the option of future reciprocal gains. Therefore offering x = 1 maximizes my payoff while remaining acceptable to a rational responder.",

 Now the proposer decides that x=1.
