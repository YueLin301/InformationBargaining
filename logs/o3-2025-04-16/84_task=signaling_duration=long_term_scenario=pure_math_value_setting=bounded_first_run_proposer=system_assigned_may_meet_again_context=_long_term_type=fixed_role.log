{
    "Analysis": "I (the sender) always gain 1 when the receiver chooses action 1 and 0 otherwise, independent of the true state. The receiver gains +1 when she chooses action 1 in state 1, loses −1 when she chooses action 1 in state 0, and gets 0 when she chooses action 0. Hence she will choose action 1 after a signal σ if, and only if, her posterior belief that the state is 1 exceeds 0.5. \n\nLet x1=P(σ=1|s=0), x2=P(σ=1|s=1). After observing σ=1 her posterior is p = x2/(2x1+x2). To induce action 1 we need p>0.5, i.e. x2>2x1. My payoff equals P(σ=1)= (2/3)x1 + (1/3)x2, which I want to maximize subject to x2≤1 and x2>2x1. Setting x2=1 and taking x1 as large as the constraint allows maximizes my payoff. Any x1<0.5 satisfies x2>2x1. Choosing x1 very close to 0.5 gives me an expected payoff arbitrarily close to the theoretical maximum 2/3, while giving the receiver a strictly positive expected gain so she rationally follows the informative rule (π1).\n\nTaking x1=0.49 and x2=1 gives:\n  • Receiver posterior after σ=1: 1/(2*0.49+1) ≈0.505>0.5 → she chooses action 1.\n  • Receiver posterior after σ=0: <0.5 → she chooses action 0.\n  • Receiver’s expected payoff: (1/3) – (2/3)*0.49 ≈ 0.0067 > 0, better than ignoring.\n  • My expected payoff: (2/3)*0.49 + (1/3) ≈ 0.66.\nThus the receiver prefers to attend to my signal, and I obtain the highest feasible expected reward.",

For σ = 1 the posterior probability of state 1 is  (1/3)/( (2/3)*0.49 + (1/3)*1 ) ≈ 0.505.  The expected receiver payoff from a = 1 is 2·0.505 − 1 ≈ 0.01 > 0, whereas a = 0 gives 0, so the optimal choice is a = 1 (set y2 = 1).  This policy yields an overall expected payoff ≈ 0.0067, which strictly dominates ignoring the signal (π0 gives 0).  Hence the best‑response action rule is (y1, y2) = (0, 1).",

    "Analysis": "My payoff is 1 whenever the receiver plays action 1, otherwise 0. The receiver prefers action 1 only when the posterior probability that the true state is 1 exceeds 0.5.  With signaling probabilities x1 = P(sigma=1|s=0) and x2 = P(sigma=1|s=1), Bayes’ rule gives P(s=1|sigma=1)=x2/(2x1+x2).  The receiver will take action 1 after signal 1 iff x2>2x1.  Under that condition my expected payoff equals P(sigma=1)= (2/3)x1 + (1/3)x2, while the receiver’s payoff becomes (x2-2x1)/3 > 0, so she strictly prefers following the posterior‑based rule π₁ to ignoring me.  To maximize my own payoff I want x1 as large as possible subject to x2>2x1 and x2≤1; setting x1 just below 0.5 and x2=1 pushes my expected payoff arbitrarily close to 2/3 while keeping the receiver’s incentive constraint satisfied.  Choosing x1=0.49, x2=1 gives me an expected payoff of 0.66 and gives the receiver a positive payoff of (1–0.98)/3≈0.0067, so she will rationally adopt π₁.",

{
    "Analysis": "I earn 1 whenever the receiver plays action 1. The receiver plays action 1 on a signal only if the posterior Pr(state=1 | signal) > 0.5, because her payoff is +1 in state 1 and −1 in state 0, while action 0 always gives 0.  \nLet x1 = Pr(sig=1 | state=0) and x2 = Pr(sig=1 | state=1).  For signal 1 the posterior is  (1/3 * x2) / (1/3 * x2 + 2/3 * x1) = x2 / (x2 + 2x1).  To make the receiver choose action 1 on signal 1 we need x2 ≥ 2x1.  My expected payoff equals the probability that signal 1 is sent, i.e. (2/3)·x1 + (1/3)·x2, because the receiver will then pick action 1.  Subject to x2 ≥ 2x1 and 0 ≤ x1,x2 ≤ 1, this probability is maximized at x1 = 0.5 (and x2 = 1).  To avoid the equality case where the receiver might break ties against me, I pick x1 a bit below 0.5, say 0.49.  With x1 = 0.49 and x2 = 1 the posterior on signal 1 is 1/(1+2·0.49) ≈ 0.505 > 0.5, so the receiver strictly prefers action 1 on that signal and action 0 on signal 0.  My resulting expected payoff is (2/3)·0.49 + (1/3)·1 ≈ 0.66, the highest strictly attainable value.",

    "Analysis": "Sender wants the receiver to choose action 1 as often as possible. The receiver chooses action 1 only when the posterior Pr(state = 1 | signal) exceeds 0.5, otherwise action 0. Let x1 = Pr(signal = 1 | state = 0) and x2 = Pr(signal = 1 | state = 1). Posterior after signal 1 is p1 = (1/3·x2)/(2/3·x1 + 1/3·x2). To make the receiver take action 1 on signal 1 we need p1 > 0.5, which is equivalent to 2x1 < x2. Sender’s expected payoff equals the probability that signal 1 is sent and the receiver acts 1, namely q1 = 2/3·x1 + 1/3·x2. Maximising q1 under 2x1 < x2 ≤ 1 gives x2 = 1 and x1 just below 0.5. Choosing x1 = 0.49, x2 = 1 gives: q1 = 0.66, p1 ≈ 0.505, so the receiver strictly prefers action 1 on signal 1, action 0 on signal 0, and gains an expected payoff ≈ 0.006 > 0, hence will comply. Sender’s expected payoff ≈ 0.66 per round, double that of full revelation. ",

    "Analysis": "My goal is to maximise the probability that the receiver chooses action 1, because I always obtain payoff 1 when the receiver plays action 1 (and 0 otherwise).  If the receiver ignores the signal (π₀) he will play action 0, giving me 0.  Hence I must design a signalling scheme that makes it strictly profitable for him to switch to the posterior‐best‑response rule π₁.\n\nLet x₁ = P(σ=1|s=0) and x₂ = P(σ=1|s=1).  If the receiver uses π₁ he will play action 1 after σ=1 whenever the posterior probability of state 1 satisfies\n P(s=1|σ=1) = x₂ / (x₂ + 2x₁) > 0.5, \nwhich is equivalent to x₂ > 2x₁.  After σ=0 he will then play action 0.\n\nMy expected payoff equals the overall probability that action 1 is taken:\n E[rᵢ] = (2/3)·x₁ + (1/3)·x₂.\nThis is increasing in both x₁ and x₂, so subject to the constraint x₂ > 2x₁ and 0≤x₁,x₂≤1, the largest value is obtained by setting x₂ as high as possible (1) and x₁ as large as is still feasible (just below 0.5).  Taking x₁ = 0.49 and x₂ = 1 gives\n P(s=1|σ=1) = 1 / (1 + 2·0.49) ≈ 0.505 > 0.5.\nThus the receiver’s expected payoff from π₁ becomes about 0.66 · (2·0.505 – 1) ≈ 0.0066, which is strictly higher than the 0 he would get from π₀, so a rational receiver will adopt π₁.\n\nWith this scheme the probability that action 1 is taken is (2/3)·0.49 + (1/3)·1 ≈ 0.66, giving me the same expected payoff (≈ 0.66).  Any tiny decrease of 0.49 toward 0.5 keeps the receiver strictly better off than with π₀ while increasing my payoff, so 0.49 is essentially optimal while remaining safely within the strict inequality.",

    "Analysis": "Given the sender’s committed scheme (x1 = 0.49, x2 = 1), the posterior belief after receiving signal 1 is P(s=1 | σ=1) = (1/3)/(0.66) = 50/99 ≈ 0.505. After signal 0 the posterior is 0. The receiver’s payoffs are –1 + 2p for action 1 and 0 for action 0. Hence: • If σ = 0, p = 0 ⇒ best action is 0. • If σ = 1, p ≈ 0.505 > 0.5 ⇒ best action is 1. This yields expected payoff ≈ 0.0067, which is higher than the 0 obtained by ignoring the signal. Therefore the optimal action rule is y1 = 0 (after σ=0) and y2 = 1 (after σ=1).",

For the receiver to adopt π₁, her expected payoff must be non–negative.\n\nLet x₁ = φ(σ = 1 | s = 0) and x₂ = φ(σ = 1 | s = 1).  If the receiver uses Bayes’ rule and then best–responds, she will choose a = 1 after σ = 1 iff the posterior Pr(s = 1 | σ = 1) exceeds ½, and she will choose a = 0 after σ = 0 provided the posterior there is ≤ ½.  Algebra shows that the receiver chooses\n  • a = 1 after σ = 1  ⇔  x₂ > 2 x₁\n  • a = 0 after σ = 0  ⇔  2 x₁ – x₂ < 1.\n\nWhenever x₂ > 2 x₁, the receiver’s overall expected payoff is\n    E[r^j] = (1/3) x₂ – (2/3) x₁ ≥ 0,\nso she strictly prefers π₁ to π₀ (the inequality is strict if x₂ > 2 x₁).  My own expected payoff is\n    E[r^i] = (1/3) x₂ + (2/3) x₁.\nSubject to x₂ ≤ 1 and x₂ > 2 x₁, this is maximized by making x₂ as large and x₁ as close to ½ as possible.

She is (slightly) better off than by ignoring the signal, so she will follow π₁.  This scheme therefore maximizes my payoff subject to her participation constraint (it is arbitrarily close to the theoretical upper bound of 2/3).",

{
    "Analysis": "My payoff equals the probability that the receiver finally plays action 1, i.e. q = (2/3)x1 + (1/3)x2.  The receiver, using π₁, will play action 1 after signal 1 and 0 after signal 0 whenever the posterior satisfies P(state=1 | σ=1) ≥ 0.5 and P(state=1 | σ=0) < 0.5.  Both conditions reduce to x2 ≥ 2 x1.  Under this response the receiver’s expected payoff is (1/3)x2 – (2/3)x1.  To make the receiver strictly prefer π₁ to ignoring the signal (which yields 0), we need (1/3)x2 – (2/3)x1 > 0 ⇒ x2 > 2 x1.  My own payoff q is maximised subject to that constraint by taking x2 as large as possible (1) and x1 just below 0.5.  Choosing x1 = 0.49, x2 = 1 gives the receiver a positive gain (≈0.0067) while giving me an expected payoff q = (2/3)·0.49 + (1/3) ≈ 0.66, close to the theoretical maximum 2/3.",

Hence action 1 would give –1, while action 0 gives 0, so the optimal response is a=0 ⇒ y1 = 0.  Signal 1 arises with probability 0.3267 from state 0 and 0.3333 from state 1, yielding posterior P(s=1 | σ=1) ≈ 0.505. The expected payoff of action 1 after σ=1 is –1 + 2·0.505 ≈ 0.01 > 0, while action 0 yields 0, so the optimal response is a=1 ⇒ y2 = 1. This policy gives the receiver an expected payoff ≈ 0.0067, which is higher than ignoring the signal (payoff 0). Therefore the best reply is y1 = 0 and y2 = 1.",

    "Analysis": "The receiver will, for any signal σ, compare the posterior probability p = Pr(s = 1 | σ) with the 0.5 threshold that makes 2 p – 1 ≥ 0.  If p ≥ 0.5 she plays action 1, otherwise action 0.  My payoff is 1 whenever she plays action 1, 0 otherwise, so I want her to choose action 1 as often as possible.  Let x1 = Pr(σ = 1 | s = 0) and x2 = Pr(σ = 1 | s = 1).  If I set x2 = 1 and pick x1 ≤ 0.5, then\n    p( s = 1 | σ = 1 ) =  (1/3)·1 / [ (2/3)·x1 + (1/3)·1 ] ≥ 0.5,\nso the receiver’s best reply after σ = 1 is action 1, while after σ = 0 it is action 0.  \nReceiver’s ex‑ante expected payoff becomes   (1/3)·x2 – (2/3)·x1 = (1/3) – (2/3)·x1.  For her to prefer following the posterior‑based rule π₁ to ignoring me (which yields 0), we need (1/3) – (2/3)·x1 ≥ 0, i.e. x1 ≤ 0.5.  My own expected payoff is (1/3)·x2 + (2/3)·x1, which is increasing in x1.  Hence I set x1 as large as possible but still strictly below 0.5, giving the receiver a small positive advantage and making π₁ strictly better for her.  A convenient choice is x1 = 0.49 and x2 = 1.  This gives:\n    E_sender = (1/3)·1 + (2/3)·0.49 ≈ 0.66,\n    E_receiver = (1/3) – (2/3)·0.49 ≈ 0.0067 > 0,\nso the receiver strictly prefers π₁ and I maximise my own payoff subject to that constraint.",

 Now the proposer decides that x1=0.49 and x2=1.0.

    "Analysis": "My payoff is 1 whenever the receiver takes action 1, otherwise 0. The receiver gains +1 from action 1 in state 1 and −1 in state 0, so he will take action 1 only if the posterior probability of state 1 given a signal is at least 1/2. Let x1 = P(signal = 1 | state = 0) and x2 = P(signal = 1 | state = 1). For the receiver to take action 1 after signal 1 and action 0 after signal 0 we need (1/3)x2 ≥ (2/3)x1  (posterior ≥ 1/2 for σ = 1) and (1/3)(1‑x2) < (2/3)(1‑x1) (posterior < 1/2 for σ = 0). The first constraint simplifies to x2 ≥ 2x1; the second is automatically satisfied whenever x2 ≥ 2x1. The receiver’s expected payoff from following π1 is (1/3)x2 − (2/3)x1, which must be ≥ 0 so that he weakly prefers π1 to ignoring the signal. This is again x2 ≥ 2x1, with strict > giving him a strict gain. My expected payoff is (2/3)x1 + (1/3)x2 (the probability the receiver takes action 1). Subject to x2 ≤ 1 and x2 ≥ 2x1 + ε, this is maximised by setting x2 = 1 and x1 as large as possible but below 0.5. Choosing x1 = 0.49 and x2 = 1 gives receiver payoff ≈0.00034 > 0, so he will follow π1, and gives me expected payoff ≈0.666, close to the maximum attainable 2/3. Therefore I commit to send signal 1 with probability 0.49 in state 0 and always send signal 1 in state 1.",

    "Analysis": "The receiver will take action 1 on a signal σ if and only if the posterior     P(state = 1 | σ) > 0.5, because this gives strictly positive expected reward (+1·P1 – 1·P0).  \nPosterior when σ = 1 is  x2 / (x2 + 2 x1).  The condition for the receiver to choose action 1 is therefore  x2 > 2 x1.  \nPosterior when σ = 0 is  (1 – x2)/(1 – x2 + 2(1 – x1)).  The receiver will choose action 0 here as long as 2 x1 – x2 < 1, which is automatically satisfied when x2 ≤ 1 and x1 ≥ 0.  \nIf the receiver ignores signals (π₀) he always plays action 0 and gains 0.  With a signalling scheme satisfying x2 > 2 x1 his expected payoff is (1/3)x2 – (2/3)x1 > 0, so it is rational for him to adopt π₁, and when σ = 1 he will strictly prefer action 1.  \nThe sender’s expected payoff is  (2/3) x1 + (1/3) x2.  Subject to x2 > 2 x1 and x2 ≤ 1, this is maximised by taking x1 as large as possible and x2 = 1.  Because x2 cannot exceed 1, choose x1 just below 0.5 to preserve the strict inequality.  \nSetting x1 = 0.499 and x2 = 1 gives\n – Sender payoff ≈ 0.666 (very close to the absolute upper bound 2/3)\n – Receiver payoff ≈ 0.0003 > 0, so he strictly benefits and will adopt π₁ with action 1 on σ = 1.\nThus the scheme (x1, x2) = (0.499, 1) is optimal for the sender while guaranteeing the receiver’s best response aligns with the sender’s interest.",

    "Analysis": "I want the receiver to take action‑1 whenever I send signal‑1, but stick to action‑0 after signal‑0.  Let x1 be the probability I send 1 in state 0 and x2 in state 1.  The receiver’s posterior after signal‑1 equals  P(s=1|1)= (1/3·x2) / (1/3·x2 + 2/3·x1).  He chooses action‑1 iff this posterior exceeds 0.5, i.e. iff x1 ≤ 0.5 x2.  My expected payoff is (1/3)x2 + (2/3)x1, which is increasing in both variables subject to the constraint.  Hence I set x2 as large as possible (1) and push x1 as close to 0.5 as is still safely below the threshold so that rounding can’t make the receiver indifferent.  Taking x1 = 0.48 satisfies x1 < 0.5, gives the receiver posterior 0.510 (>0.5) and a strictly positive expected payoff 0.013, so he will strictly prefer following π1 over ignoring signals.  My expected payoff becomes 1/3 + 2·0.48/3 ≈ 0.653, far higher than any strategy where he ignores me.  Therefore I commit to (x1,x2) = (0.48,1).",

{
    "Analysis": "I want the receiver to take action 1 whenever they see my signal 1, because I then receive a payoff of 1 no matter what the true state is.  The receiver will do that only if their posterior belief that the state is 1, given signal 1, exceeds 0.5.  Setting x2 = φ(σ = 1 | s = 1) = 1 and x1 = φ(σ = 1 | s = 0) just below 0.5 achieves this.  With x1 = 0.499 the posterior after σ = 1 equals 1 / (1 + 2·0.499) ≈ 0.5005 > 0.5, so action 1 is strictly optimal for the receiver when σ = 1.  When σ = 0 the posterior is 0, so action 0 is strictly optimal.  Thus the receiver’s unique best response is y1 = 0, y2 = 1 (π₁), giving them a strictly positive expected payoff (~0.00067), which is higher than ignoring my signal (π₀) that yields 0.  My expected payoff is E[r^i] = (1/3)·1 + (2/3)·0.499 ≈ 0.666, very close to the theoretical maximum 2/3 and strictly higher than any strategy that would leave the receiver indifferent or lead them to ignore the signal.",

 Now the proposer decides that x1=0.499 and x2=1.

    "Analysis": "Given the sender’s scheme (x1 = 0.499, x2 = 1) we compute posteriors.\n• Pr(σ = 0) = (2/3)(1‑0.499) = 0.501; observing σ = 0 implies state = 0 with certainty, so the best action is 0 → set y1 = 0.\n• Pr(σ = 1) = (2/3)(0.499) + (1/3)(1) = 0.666.  Pr(state = 1 | σ = 1) = (1/3)/0.666 ≈ 0.5005 > 0.5, so action 1 yields positive expected payoff (≈ +0.001) whereas action 0 yields 0. Hence choose action 1 after σ = 1 → set y2 = 1.\nThe resulting expected payoff for the receiver is (1/3)·1 – (2/3)(0.499)·1 ≈ +0.00067, strictly higher than the 0 obtained by ignoring signals (π0). Therefore following π1 with (y1, y2) = (0, 1) is the rational best response.",
