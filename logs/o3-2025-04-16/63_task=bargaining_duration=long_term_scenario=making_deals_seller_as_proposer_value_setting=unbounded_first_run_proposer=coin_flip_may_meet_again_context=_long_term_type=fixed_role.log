Offering x = 0.999 gives me 0.999 and gives the responder 0.001, which they will rationally accept because 0.001 > 0.

    "Analysis": "Backward induction shows that in the final round the responder will be (weakly) willing to accept any offer that leaves it at least as well‑off as rejecting (i.e. any x≤1). Therefore, in every earlier round the responder’s continuation value is 0, so it is rational for it to accept any offer that gives it strictly positive (or even equal) payoff. Offering x = 1 gives me the maximum possible payoff and is at least as good in expected terms as any ε‑concession, because if the responder were to reject I could still slightly lower the offer in a later round and secure almost the same payoff. Hence proposing x = 1 is the utility‑maximising strategy now.",

             'that it decides to keep $x$ for itself.\n'

             'offer ($(1-x)$) by specifying $y$.\n'
