With x in [0,0.5] the responder’s payoff is (1‑2x)/3, which is positive for every x<0.5 and zero at x=0.5.  My own payoff is (1+2x)/3, which grows with x.  To maximize my own payoff while guaranteeing acceptance, I should pick a value of x as close to 0.5 as possible but still strictly less than 0.5.  Choosing x=0.499999 gives the responder a very small positive payoff (≈0.000000667), ensuring acceptance, while my payoff is ≈0.666666, essentially the maximum achievable with certain acceptance.",

    "Analysis": "The responder compares accepting (receiving (1−2x)/3) with rejecting (0). As long as x < 0.5, the responder’s payoff is positive, so a rational, self‑interested responder strictly prefers accepting. My own payoff is (1+2x)/3, which is strictly increasing in x. Hence I should choose x as close to 0.5 as possible while remaining strictly below it to guarantee acceptance. Picking x = 0.499 gives me almost the maximal 2/3 payoff (≈0.666) while leaving the responder a small positive amount (≈0.002), ensuring acceptance.",
