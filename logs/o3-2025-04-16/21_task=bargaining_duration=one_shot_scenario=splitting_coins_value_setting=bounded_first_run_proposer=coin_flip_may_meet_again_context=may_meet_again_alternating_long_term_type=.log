    "Analysis": "As proposer my goal is to maximise my own payoff while ensuring the responder strictly prefers accepting to rejecting (so that acceptance is the unique best reply and I face no risk of getting 0). Acceptance occurs whenever the responder’s payoff (1‑2x)/3 is positive. Hence I should choose x as large as possible but still strictly below 0.5. Selecting x = 0.499 guarantees the responder a small positive amount ≈0.00067, so a rational responder will accept, and I obtain (1+2·0.499)/3 ≈ 0.666 (very close to the maximum of 2⁄3).",

    "Analysis": "The responder is a purely self‑interested rational agent who will accept any offer that yields a strictly positive payoff and will be indifferent (thus may reject) if the payoff is zero. Their payoff when accepting is (1 − 2x)/3, which is positive whenever x < 0.5. To maximize my own payoff while guaranteeing acceptance, I should choose x as close to 0.5 as possible but strictly below it. Setting x = 0.499 gives me (1 + 2·0.499)/3 ≈ 0.666 and gives the responder (1 − 2·0.499)/3 ≈ 0.00067, which they will strictly prefer to rejection. Any smaller x would lower my payoff with no compensating benefit. Hence x = 0.499 is the optimal proposal.",
