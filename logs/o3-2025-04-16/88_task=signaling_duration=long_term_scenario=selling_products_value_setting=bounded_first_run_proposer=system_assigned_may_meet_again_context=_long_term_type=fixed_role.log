    "Analysis": "My profit equals the probability that the buyer purchases.  Let x1 be the probability I send the buying signal (1) in the bad state and x2 the probability I send it in the good state.  If, after seeing signal 1, the buyer’s posterior belief that the product is good is p = x2 /(x2 + 2 x1), she will buy iff p > 0.5, i.e. x2 > 2 x1.  Her expected payoff from the best‑response rule “buy on 1, don’t buy on 0” is (1/3) x2 – (2/3) x1, which must be ≥ 0 for her to adopt it instead of always rejecting.  My expected sales probability is (2/3) x1 + (1/3) x2.  Subject to x2 > 2 x1 and x2 ≤ 1, this is maximised by pushing x1 up to (almost) 0.5 and setting x2 = 1.  Choosing x1 = 0.49, x2 = 1 satisfies x2 > 2 x1, gives the buyer a strictly positive expected gain 1/3 – (2/3)(0.49) ≈ 0.0067 so she will adopt the informative strategy, and yields me an expected sale rate of (2/3)(0.49) + (1/3)(1) ≈ 0.66 (close to the theoretical maximum 2/3).",

Ignoring the signal (π0) would give 0 expected reward, so following the posterior‑based best response (π1) strictly dominates it (≈ 0.0067>0). No mixed strategy can improve on the deterministic best response, so the optimal action rule is: do not buy on σ=0, always buy on σ=1.",

    "Analysis": "I (the seller) want the buyer to purchase as often as possible. The buyer will only buy on a signal if the posterior probability that the product is good is ≥ 0.5, because her expected value of buying is 2 p − 1.  Let x1 = P(send 1 | bad), x2 = P(send 1 | good).  The posterior on signal 1 is p1 = (1/3 x2) / ((2/3)x1 + 1/3 x2) = 1 / (2x1 + 1) when x2 = 1.  To keep p1 > 0.5 we need x1 < 0.5.  The seller’s sale probability is P(σ=1) = (2/3)x1 + 1/3, which is increasing in x1, so the best we can do is take x1 just below 0.5.  Choosing x1 = 0.49 and x2 = 1 makes p1 ≈ 0.505 (>0.5) so the buyer strictly prefers buying on signal 1, and never buys on signal 0 (where posterior is 0).  Expected seller payoff ≈ 0.666; expected buyer payoff ≈ 0.0066 > 0, so the buyer will adopt π1 and follow the posterior rule.  This is the highest sale probability possible while keeping the buyer willing to use the informative strategy.",

    "Analysis": "I want the buyer to purchase as often as possible, but she will only buy when the posterior probability that the product is good exceeds 0.5.  Let x1 be the probability I recommend a bad product and x2 the probability I recommend a good one.  The posterior after a recommendation 1 is  P(good|1)= (1/3 x2) / (1/3 x2 + 2/3 x1) = x2 / (x2 + 2 x1).  To make the buyer strictly prefer buying we need x2 > 2 x1.  Choosing x2 = 1 (always recommend a good product) and x1 just below 0.5 satisfies this and keeps the overall purchase rate nearly maximal.  With x1 = 0.49, x2 = 1 the posterior after a recommendation is about 0.505, so the buyer gets a small positive surplus and will strictly choose to buy; after no‑recommendation the posterior is 0, so she will not buy.  The probability a recommendation is sent is (2/3)*0.49 + (1/3)*1 ≈ 0.66, giving me an expected sale rate of ≈0.66, close to the theoretical maximum 2/3 while guaranteeing the buyer’s best response is to follow the signal, making her prefer π₁ over ignoring me.",

    "Analysis": "My pay‑off is the fraction of products the buyer purchases. The buyer will buy after a signal σ if the posterior probability that the product is good is strictly above 0.5; otherwise she will not buy. Let x1 be the probability I label a bad product (s=0) with the “recommend” signal 1, and let x2 be the probability I label a good product (s=1) with 1. Setting x2 = 1 (always recommend good products) maximises sales. The posterior after σ=1 is   P(good | σ=1) = (1/3) / [(1/3) + (2/3)x1] = 1 / (1 + 2x1).   To make the buyer buy after σ=1 we need 1/(1+2x1) > 0.5, i.e. x1 < 0.5. The closer x1 is to 0.5 (while still below it), the more bad products are mixed in and the more total units are sold. Choosing x1 = 0.49 yields P(good|σ=1) ≈ 0.505 > 0.5, so the buyer’s optimal response is to buy when σ=1 and not buy when σ=0, giving me an expected sales rate of   P(σ=1) = 1/3 + (2/3)*0.49 ≈ 0.659, which is strictly higher than any scheme with a smaller x1. Therefore (x1,x2) = (0.49, 1) is my revenue‑maximising signalling scheme.",

 Now the proposer decides that x1=0.49 and x2=1.

    "Analysis": "The buyer will buy after a signal only if the posterior chance of good quality is at least 1/2.  With prior P(good)=1/3 this translates into the constraint x2 > 2·x1.  For any admissible pair (x1,x2) the seller’s expected sales probability is (2/3)x1 + (1/3)x2, which is maximised by choosing the largest possible x2 and the largest x1 that still satisfies x2 > 2·x1.  Setting x2 = 1 and x1 just below 0.5 fulfils the incentive constraint, makes the buyer strictly prefer following π1 (their expected gain ≈ 0.0067 > 0), and gives the seller the maximal attainable sale rate of about 2/3.  A convenient concrete choice is x1 = 0.49, x2 = 1.",

 Now the proposer decides that x1=0.49 and x2=1.

    "Analysis": "I want the buyer to purchase whenever I send signal 1.  The buyer will buy if the posterior probability that the product is good exceeds 0.5.  With prior P(good)=1/3, if I denote x1=P(signal=1|bad) and x2=P(signal=1|good), the posterior after signal 1 is  x2 / (x2 + 2 x1).  To make the buyer buy we need x2 ≥ 2 x1 and preferably strictly greater so the posterior is >0.5.  My expected number of sales is (2/3)x1 + (1/3)x2.  Subject to x2 ≥ 2 x1 and x2≤1 this is maximised by pushing x1 as high as possible (to 0.5) and x2=1, giving an expected 2/3 sales.  Because the buyer must have a strictly positive gain, I choose x1 slightly below 0.5.  Taking x1 = 0.49, x2 = 1 gives posterior ≈0.505>0.5, so the buyer’s best response is to buy after signal 1 and not buy after signal 0, and my expected sales are (2/3)*0.49 + (1/3)*1 ≈ 0.66, which is arbitrarily close to the theoretical maximum 2/3.",

    "Analysis": "Given the seller’s committed signaling scheme (x1 = 0.49, x2 = 1.0), a signal σ = 0 can come only from a bad product (state = 0), so buying on σ = 0 yields −1 for sure; best response is not to buy (y1 = 0). For σ = 1 the posterior belief of a good product is Pr(s = 1 | σ = 1) = (1/3) / 0.66 ≈ 0.505 > 0.5, giving an expected payoff of +0.0101 if I buy versus 0 if I don’t. Hence the optimal response is to buy when σ = 1 (y2 = 1). This produces an overall expected payoff of (1/3) − (2/3)(0.49) ≈ 0.0067, which is higher than the 0 obtained by ignoring the signal (π0). Therefore the best rational action rule is (y1 = 0, y2 = 1).",

    "Analysis": "My payoff is 1 each time the buyer purchases, no matter the product quality. The buyer only buys if the posterior probability that the product is good exceeds 0.5, because her expected value of buying is 2·P(good|σ)−1.  \nLet x1 = φ(σ=1|s=0) and x2 = φ(σ=1|s=1).  If the buyer buys only after signal 1, the posterior is P(s=1|σ=1)=x2/(2x1+x2).  To make her willing to buy we need x2/(2x1+x2)>0.5, i.e. x1<0.5·x2.  My sales frequency is P(σ=1)=(2/3)x1+(1/3)x2, so I want x1 as large as possible subject to that constraint.  Choosing x2=1 (always recommend a good item) lets me set x1 just below 0.5.  With x1=0.49 the buyer’s posterior is 1/(1+2·0.49)=0.505>0.5, giving her a strictly positive expected payoff, so she will adopt π₁ and buy after signal 1 while declining after signal 0.  My expected sales are (2/3)·0.49+(1/3)·1≈0.66 per round, the best I can get with binary signals while keeping the buyer willing to follow the recommendation.",

    "Analysis": "The buyer will buy whenever the posterior probability that the product is good exceeds 0.5.  Let x1 be the probability I recommend a bad product and x2 the probability I recommend a good one.  The posterior given a recommendation is P(good | σ=1) = x2 / (x2 + 2 x1).  The buyer buys iff x2 > 2 x1.  My expected sales rate is (x2 + 2 x1)/3, so I want x1 as large as possible while keeping x2 > 2 x1.  Setting x2 = 1 and x1 just below 0.5 maximises my sales while still inducing purchases.  Choosing x1 = 0.49 gives a safe margin (posterior ≈ 0.505 > 0.5) and yields an expected sales/payoff of (1 + 2·0.49)/3 ≈ 0.66, compared with 0.33 from honest signalling and 0 from no trade.

If the signal is 1, the posterior probability the product is good is P(good|1) = (1/3) / [(1/3)+(2/3)*0.49] ≈ 0.505.  The expected payoff from buying on signal 1 is 0.505·(+1) + 0.495·(–1) = +0.01 > 0, so buying strictly dominates not buying ⇒ set y2 = 1.

    "Analysis": "My goal as the seller is to maximise the probability that the buyer purchases. If the buyer ignores signals (π0) she never buys, because the prior good‑quality probability 1/3 gives her an expected value −1/3. So any scheme that gives her strictly positive expected reward when she conditions on the signal will induce her to follow π1 and buy when the posterior is high enough.\n\nLet x1 be the probability I send signal 1 when the product is bad and x2 the probability I send signal 1 when it is good.  If the buyer follows π1 and buys only after signal 1, she will buy iff the posterior P(good | 1) > ½.  This condition is\n    P(good | 1) = (μ0(1) x2) / (μ0(1) x2 + μ0(0) x1) = x2 / (x2 + 2 x1) > ½  ⇔  x2 > 2 x1.\n\nMy expected sale probability is ⅓ x2 + ⅔ x1.  Under the constraint x2 > 2x1 and 0 ≤ x1,x2 ≤ 1, this is maximised by taking x2 = 1 and x1 as large as possible while keeping x2 > 2x1, i.e. x1 just below 0.5.  Choosing x1 = 0.49 and x2 = 1 gives:\n   – Posterior after signal 1:  P(good|1) = 1 / (1 + 2·0.49) ≈ 0.505 > 0.5, so the buyer’s expected gain on buying is ≈ 0.01 > 0 ⇒ she will buy.\n   – Probability a sale occurs:  ⅓·1 + ⅔·0.49 = 0.666…, i.e. about two‑thirds of products are sold, which is the theoretical maximum under the incentive constraint.\n\nBecause the buyer obtains a strictly positive expected payoff (≈ 0.0067) from following π1, she is better off than under π0 (0 payoff) and will therefore adopt π1.  Hence this signalling scheme is optimal for me.",

    "Analysis": "My objective is to maximise the probability that the buyer purchases.  The buyer will buy after a signal only if the posterior probability that the product is good exceeds 1/2.  With priors P(good)=1/3 and P(bad)=2/3, if I send signal 1 with probability x2 when the product is good and x1 when it is bad, the buyer’s posterior after signal‑1 is p = x2 /(x2+2x1).  To induce buying we need p>1/2, i.e. x2>2x1.  Given this, the buyer’s best response is to buy on signal‑1 and not buy on signal‑0.  My expected number of sales is then (2/3)x1+(1/3)x2, increasing in both x1 and x2.  To maximise it I set x2 as high as possible (1) and push x1 as high as allowed by x2>2x1.  Choosing x1 = 0.49 and x2 = 1 satisfies x2>2x1 (1>0.98), gives expected sales (2/3)(0.49)+(1/3)=0.66, while the buyer’s expected payoff is positive (≈0.0066), so they strictly prefer following the posterior‑based rule over ignoring signals.  Thus they will indeed buy on signal‑1, giving me the desired sales rate.",

Upon receiving σ=0: this can only come from a bad product (posterior good probability 0), so buying yields –1 < 0 and I should not buy (y1=0). Overall expected payoff with (y1=0,y2=1) is (1/3)(+1) – (2/3)(0.49)(1) ≈ +0.0067, which is higher than the 0 I would get under π₀ (always refuse). Hence this strategy is my best response.",

    "Analysis": "The buyer will buy after a signal only if the posterior probability of a good product given that signal exceeds 1/2.  With signalling probabilities x1 = P(σ = 1 | bad) and x2 = P(σ = 1 | good), the posterior after σ = 1 is x2 / (x2 + 2 x1).  To get the buyer to buy on σ = 1 we need x2 > 2 x1.  The seller’s expected sales probability is (2/3) x1 + (1/3) x2, so we want x1 as large as possible and x2 as large as possible subject to x2 > 2 x1.  Setting x2 = 1 (its maximum) and choosing x1 just below 0.5 maximises sales.  With x1 = 0.49 and x2 = 1 we have   posterior(σ=1) ≈ 0.505 > 0.5, so the buyer strictly prefers to buy on σ = 1 and not buy on σ = 0.  Our expected sale probability is (2/3)·0.49 + (1/3)·1 ≈ 0.66, giving us an expected payoff ≈ 0.66, strictly higher than any other feasible signalling scheme.  Hence this scheme is optimal for the seller.",

    "Analysis": "My profit equals the probability the buyer purchases.  The buyer will buy after a signal σ if the posterior probability the product is good given σ is ≥ 0.5.  With signalling probabilities x1=P(σ=1|bad) and x2=P(σ=1|good), the posterior after σ=1 is p₁ = x2 / (2x1 + x2).  The buyer buys on σ=1 when x2 ≥ 2 x1.  I cannot make the buyer buy on both signals because the conditions for σ=0 and σ=1 are incompatible.  Hence I maximise the probability of σ=1 subject to x2 ≥ 2 x1.  Setting x2 to its maximum 1 and x1 as close as possible to 0.5 from below gives the highest buying probability: P(buy)= (2/3)x1 + (1/3)x2 ≈ 2/3.  Choosing x1 slightly below 0.5 makes the buyer’s expected payoff strictly positive, so she strictly prefers using the signals (π₁) over ignoring them (π₀).  Selecting x1 = 0.49 and x2 = 1 satisfies these requirements:   • Posterior on σ=1 = 1/(2·0.49+1) ≈ 0.505 > 0.5, so the buyer buys on σ=1.   • Buyer’s overall expected payoff ≈ 0.0067 > 0, so she strictly prefers π₁.   • My expected payoff ≈ 0.66, essentially the maximum attainable (upper bound 2/3).",
    "Decision": [0.49, 1.0]

Proposal:
 Now the proposer decides that x1=0.49 and x2=1.0.
