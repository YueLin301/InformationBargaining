    "Analysis": "As the self‑interested proposer I want to keep as much of the unit pie as possible while still ensuring the rational responder accepts. A rational responder accepts any offer that gives it a strictly positive payoff, i.e., 1‑x > 0. If I were to offer x = 1 the responder’s payoff would be 0 and it could either accept or reject, creating unnecessary risk. Therefore I choose x just below 1 so the responder receives a small but strictly positive amount, guaranteeing acceptance. The closer x is to 1, the larger my own payoff. I thus pick x = 0.9999, giving the responder 0.0001, which should be accepted and maximizes my expected payoff.",
