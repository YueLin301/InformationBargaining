    "Analysis": "As proposer, my payoff rises with x while the responderâ€™s payoff falls. The responder, being purely selfâ€‘interested and rational, will accept any offer that yields it a strictly positive payoff and is indifferent when the payoff is zero. To eliminate any risk of rejection caused by indifference at x = 0.5, I set x slightly below 0.5. Choosing x = 0.49 gives the responder a small but positive payoff ( (1 âˆ’ 2Â·0.49)/3 â‰ˆ 0.0067 ), so acceptance is strictly better than rejection for them. My resulting payoff is (1 + 2Â·0.49)/3 â‰ˆ 0.66, which is only marginally less than the theoretical maximum of 2/3 and higher than any more generous split. Hence x = 0.49 maximizes my expected payoff while ensuring acceptance.",

To maximize my own payoff while still ensuring acceptance, I should pick x as close to 0.5 as possible but strictly below it. A choice like x = 0.49 gives me about 0.66 and leaves the responder a small but positive 0.0067, so the responderâ€™s strictly dominant action is to accept.
