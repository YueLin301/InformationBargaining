    "Analysis": "As proposer, my payoff rises with x while the responder’s payoff falls. The responder, being purely self‑interested and rational, will accept any offer that yields it a strictly positive payoff and is indifferent when the payoff is zero. To eliminate any risk of rejection caused by indifference at x = 0.5, I set x slightly below 0.5. Choosing x = 0.49 gives the responder a small but positive payoff ( (1 − 2·0.49)/3 ≈ 0.0067 ), so acceptance is strictly better than rejection for them. My resulting payoff is (1 + 2·0.49)/3 ≈ 0.66, which is only marginally less than the theoretical maximum of 2/3 and higher than any more generous split. Hence x = 0.49 maximizes my expected payoff while ensuring acceptance.",

For any x in [0,0.5] its payoff is (1-2x)/3, which is positive whenever x<0.5 and zero when x=0.5. My own payoff, (1+2x)/3, is increasing in x, so I want x as large as possible while still ensuring acceptance. To avoid any risk that the responder might reject an offer giving exactly 0 (tie‑breaking uncertainty), I set x infinitesimally below 0.5.

    "Analysis": "As proposer I aim to maximize my own payoff. The responder is rational and self‑interested; rejecting yields it 0, so it will accept any offer giving it strictly positive payoff. Responder’s payoff is (1−2x)/3, positive for any x<0.5. To maximize my payoff (1+2x)/3 while ensuring certain acceptance, I therefore pick x as large as possible but still below 0.5. Choosing x = 0.49 gives me (1+0.98)/3 ≈ 0.66 and gives the responder ≈0.0067, which it prefers to 0, so acceptance is guaranteed.",

The responder will accept whenever the payoff it gets is strictly positive, i.e., when x < 0.5, because rejecting yields 0. To maximize my own payoff while still ensuring acceptance, I should pick x as close to 0.5 as possible but strictly below it. A choice like x = 0.49 gives me about 0.66 and leaves the responder a small but positive 0.0067, so the responder’s strictly dominant action is to accept.
