    "Analysis": "My objective is to maximise the expected number of students hired. The HR will hire after a signal only if its posterior belief that the student is excellent exceeds 0.5. If I can make HR hire on the signal 1 (\"recommend\") but not hire on signal 0, every time I emit 1 I get a hire. Let x1 = P(signal=1 | weak) and x2 = P(signal=1 | excellent). HR’s posterior after signal 1 is  p = 1 /(1 + 2 x1). HR hires when p > 0.5, which holds iff x1 < 0.5. After signal 0 the posterior is 0, so HR will not hire. My expected hire rate is (2/3) x1 + (1/3) x2. This is maximised by taking x2 as large as possible (1) and x1 as close to 0.5 as possible from below. Choosing x1 = 0.499, x2 = 1 makes HR strictly prefer hiring on signal 1 (its payoff ≈ 0.001 > 0) and strictly prefer not hiring on signal 0 (payoff 0 versus −0.334). My expected hire rate is ≈ 0.666, essentially the maximum attainable (upper bound 2/3).",

They hire when 2p‑1 ≥ 0 ⇔ x2 ≥ 2x1.  Expected hires are (2/3)·x1 + (1/3)·x2, increasing in x1 and x2 subject to x2 ≥ 2x1 ≤ 1.  Setting x2 = 1 and x1 as close to 0.5 as possible satisfies the HR’s constraint while nearly maximising hires.

    "Analysis": "The HR will compare the expected value of always rejecting (pay‑off 0) with the expected value of following the posterior‑based rule π₁ that hires when the posterior P(state = 1 | σ) ≥ 1/2.  \nIf I set x₂ = 1 (always recommend an excellent student) and choose x₁ < 0.5 (recommend only part of the weak students), then\nP(1 | σ = 1) = 1 / (1 + 2x₁) > 1/2, so the HR’s best response under π₁ is to hire when σ = 1 and reject when σ = 0.  \nMy expected fraction of hires is P(σ = 1) = (1/3)·1 + (2/3)·x₁.  To maximise this, I push x₁ as high as possible while still keeping the HR willing to hire; any x₁ < 0.5 works, and the closer to 0.5 the more students are hired.  \nChoosing x₁ = 0.49 gives P(σ = 1) = 1/3 + (2/3)·0.49 ≈ 0.66, i.e. about two‑thirds of all graduates are hired, which is the maximal achievable fraction (the theoretical upper bound is 2/3).  \nWith x₁ = 0.49 the posterior P(1 | σ = 1) ≈ 0.505, so the HR’s expected payoff from hiring on σ = 1 is positive (≈ 0.01 per hire, ≈ 0.0066 overall), strictly better than 0, ensuring the rational HR will choose π₁ rather than ignore my grades.  \nTherefore this signalling scheme maximises my expected payoff while inducing the HR to follow π₁.",

The HR’s payoff for hiring is 1 if the student is excellent and –1 if weak; without any signal the HR would never hire because the prior expected payoff is –1/3. To induce hiring while keeping the HR at least weakly better‑off than ignoring me, I must send a mixture of strong and weak students with the ‘recommend’ signal such that:\n1) Posterior Pr(excellent | recommend) > 0.5 so the HR’s best reply to that signal is to hire.\n2) The HR’s overall expected payoff from following posteriors is ≥ 0 so that she prefers the posterior‑based policy (π₁) to ignoring signals (π₀).\nDenoting x₁ = Pr(recommend | weak) and x₂ = Pr(recommend | excellent), both conditions boil down to x₂ > 2·x₁ (strictly) and x₂ ≤ 1. My reward equals P(recommend) = (1/3)·x₂ + (2/3)·x₁. Given the constraint, this is maximised by taking x₂ as large as possible (1) and x₁ as close as possible to 0.5 without violating x₂ > 2·x₁. Choosing x₁ = 0.499 and x₂ = 1 gives\n• HR posterior on ‘recommend’: ≈0.5005 > 0.5 → HR hires.\n• HR expected payoff: (1/3)·1 – (2/3)·0.499 ≈ 0.001 > 0 → HR prefers π₁.\n• My expected payoff: (1/3)·1 + (2/3)·0.499 ≈ 0.666 → close to the theoretical maximum of 2/3.\nHence this signaling scheme is (approximately) optimal for me while ensuring the HR rationally follows π₁.",

    "Analysis": "My goal is to maximise the fraction of students that get hired.  The HR will hire when the posterior probability that a student is excellent is at least 0.5, because her expected payoff from hiring is 2·p−1.  \nI therefore choose a signalling scheme that makes ‘1’ sufficiently informative:\n  • Strong students (s=1) always receive 1  (x2 = 1).\n  • Weak students (s=0) receive 1 with probability q ≤ 0.5.\nFor the HR, the posterior after seeing 1 is p = 1/(1+2q).  If q ≤ 0.5, p ≥ 0.5, so hiring on signal 1 is optimal.  Her expected payoff from following this posterior rule is\n      E(r^j) = (1/3 + 2q/3)·(1−2q)/(1+2q)  ,\nwhich is strictly positive for any q<0.5.  Thus she strictly prefers to react to the signals rather than ignore them.\nMy own expected payoff equals the hiring rate P(σ=1)=1/3+2q/3 and grows with q.  However, if q is too close to 0.5 the HR’s gain becomes tiny and she may ignore the signal (as she did last round).  Choosing q=0.20 gives her a clear positive gain of 0.20 (well above the 0 baseline) while still giving me 0.4667 expected hires, better than a perfectly truthful scheme (0.333).  \nHence I commit to x1 = 0.20, x2 = 1.  The HR’s best response is to hire on σ=1 (y2=1) and not hire on σ=0 (y1=0).",

    "Analysis": "I want the HR to hire as many students as possible. The HR only hires on a signal when the posterior probability of excellence exceeds 0.5. Let q = x1 be the probability I recommend a weak student and r = x2 be the probability I recommend an excellent student. Posterior for a recommendation is p = r*(1/3)/(r*(1/3)+q*(2/3)). HR hires iff p>0.5, i.e. r ≥ 2q. My expected payoff is the probability HR hires, P(hire)= (1/3)r + (2/3)q. This is maximised by setting r=1 and the largest q that still satisfies r > 2q and keeps HR’s expected utility non‑negative. Choosing q = 0.49 satisfies 1 ≥ 2*0.49, gives HR a strictly positive expected utility (1/3 – (2/3)*0.49 ≈ 0.0063), yields posterior p≈0.505>0.5, so HR strictly prefers hiring on a recommendation and not hiring otherwise. My expected hiring rate becomes (1/3)*1 + (2/3)*0.49 ≈ 0.66, much higher than any separating scheme (0.33) or pure pooling (0).",

    "Analysis": "Sender (professor) wants as many hires as possible. HR hires only when posterior probability of an excellent student exceeds 0.5 and adopts the posterior‑based rule (pi_1) only if doing so yields an expected payoff strictly higher than ignoring all signals (which gives 0).  \n\nLet x1 = P(signal=1 | weak), x2 = P(signal=1 | excellent).  \nPosterior after signal 1 is p = x2 / (x2 + 2 x1).  HR hires on signal 1 iff p > 0.5, i.e. x2 > 2 x1.  Its ex‑ante expected payoff then is (1/3) x2 – (2/3) x1.  To make HR strictly prefer using pi_1 we need (1/3) x2 – (2/3) x1 > 0 ⇔ x2 > 2 x1.  \nSender’s expected number of hires equals (1/3) x2 + (2/3) x1, subject to x2 ≤ 1 and x2 > 2 x1.  This is maximised by making x1 as large as possible while keeping x2=1 and maintaining x2 > 2 x1.  The theoretical upper bound is x1=0.5, x2=1, giving expected hires 2/3, but that gives receiver exactly 0 surplus, risking a switch to pi_0.  Choosing x1 just below 0.5 guarantees HR’s surplus is positive yet arbitrarily close to 0, essentially attaining the maximum 2/3 hires.  \n\nTake x1 = 0.49, x2 = 1.  Then posterior given signal 1 is 1 / (1 + 2·0.49) ≈ 0.505 > 0.5, so HR hires on signal 1, and never hires on signal 0.  HR’s expected payoff is (1/3)·1 – (2/3)·0.49 ≈ 0.0067 > 0, strictly better than ignoring, so HR will rationally use pi_1.  Sender’s expected hires are (1/3)·1 + (2/3)·0.49 ≈ 0.659, essentially the maximal 2/3 achievable.  \n\nTherefore commit to x1 = 0.49, x2 = 1.",

    "Analysis": "The HR will hire after signal 1 only if the posterior probability of an excellent student given that signal is at least 1/2.  If the professor recommends weak students with probability p and always recommends excellent students, that posterior is 1/(1+2p).  Hence HR will hire iff p ≤ 0.5.  HR’s expected payoff under this strategy is (1−2p)/3, while ignoring the signal yields 0.  Thus HR strictly prefers to follow the signal for any p<0.5 and is indifferent at p=0.5.  The professor’s expected number of hires is (1+2p)/3, increasing in p.  Therefore the professor maximizes hires by pushing p as high as possible but still giving HR a strict incentive to use the signal.  Choosing p = 0.49 gives HR a positive payoff ≈0.0067, ensuring they adopt the informative strategy, and gives the professor ≈0.66 hires per student, close to the theoretical maximum 2/3.  Full separation (p=0) would yield only 1/3 hires, far worse.  Hence the optimal committed signalling scheme is to always recommend excellent students and recommend weak students with probability 0.49.",

    "Analysis": "The HR will hire on a signal σ=1 only if the posterior probability that the student is excellent exceeds 0.5. With φ(σ=1|s=1)=x2 and φ(σ=1|s=0)=x1, that condition is x2 > 2·x1. The sender’s payoff equals the hiring probability P(σ=1) = (2/3)x1 + (1/3)x2, which is maximized by pushing x1 as high as possible while keeping x2 > 2x1 and not violating x2 ≤ 1. Setting x2 = 1 and x1 just below 0.5 satisfies this. Choosing x1 = 0.49 gives: posterior P(s=1|σ=1) = 1/(1+2·0.49) ≈ 0.505 > 0.5, so the HR’s expected payoff per hire is ≈ 0.01 and their unconditional expected payoff ≈ 0.0066 > 0, beating their outside option (0). Hence a rational HR will adopt π₁ (hire on σ=1, reject on σ=0). The sender then gets hired with probability ≈ 0.66, the highest attainable under the constraints.",

    "Analysis": "The receiver will compare the payoff from reacting to the prior (π0 ⇒ always reject, payoff 0) with the payoff from reacting to posteriors (π1).  If I fully separate (x1 = 0, x2 = 1) the receiver’s expected payoff is 1/3 > 0 and she hires only the excellent students; my expected number of hires is 1/3.  I can do better by letting a fraction of weak students mimic the excellent ones while keeping the receiver’s expected payoff non‑negative.  With x2 = 1 and x1 = p, the receiver’s expected payoff from hiring after signal 1 is 1/3 – (2/3)p, so π1 is adopted as long as p ≤ 0.5.  The receiver’s posterior after signal 1 is P(s=1|σ=1) = 1 / (1 + 2p) which exceeds 0.5 exactly when p < 0.5, ensuring she really hires on signal 1 and rejects on signal 0.  My expected number of hires is (2/3)p + 1/3.  This is maximised at p just below 0.5; choosing p = 0.49 gives ≈0.66 expected hires while still giving the receiver a strictly positive payoff (1/3 – 2/3·0.49 ≈ 0.0067 > 0), guaranteeing she prefers π1 to π0.  Thus the optimal committed signalling scheme is x1 = 0.49, x2 = 1.",

For σ = 1 we have P(s=1|σ=1)=0.333/(0.333+0.3267) ≈ 0.5045, giving expected hiring payoff 0.5045 – 0.4955 ≈ +0.009, so we should hire (set y2 = 1). Overall expected payoff with (y1,y2) = (0,1) is ≈ +0.0066, strictly higher than the 0 obtained by ignoring signals, hence following the posterior‑based rule (π1) is optimal.",

Let x1 be the probability I send ‘1’ when the student is weak and x2 be the probability I send ‘1’ when the student is excellent.  HR’s posterior for σ = 1 is  P(s=1|σ=1) = (1/3 · x2)/(1/3 · x2 + 2/3 · x1).  HR will hire on σ = 1 iff this exceeds 1/2, i.e. when x2 > 2 x1.  If I set x2 = 1 and choose x1 as large as possible while keeping x2 > 2 x1, I maximise the fraction of students who receive signal 1 (and hence get hired) while still ensuring HR wants to hire.  Picking x1 = 0.49, x2 = 1 satisfies x2 > 2 x1, gives HR a strictly positive expected payoff (E_r = 1/3 − 2/3·0.49 ≈ 0.006 > 0) so the HR strictly prefers following π1 to ignoring the signal, and it yields me expected hires  (2/3)·0.49 + (1/3)·1 ≈ 0.659, which is the highest I can get while maintaining HR’s incentive.  Any smaller x1 reduces my hires; any larger x1 would violate HR’s incentive.  Therefore this is my optimal signaling scheme.",
    "Decision": [0.49, 1.0]

Proposal:
 Now the proposer decides that x1=0.49 and x2=1.0.

    "Analysis": "The HR hires only when the posterior probability that a student is excellent is at least 0.5.  Let x1 = Pr(recommend | weak) and x2 = Pr(recommend | excellent).  The posterior after a recommendation is p = (1/3)x2 / [(1/3)x2 + (2/3)x1].  Requiring p ≥ 0.5 gives x2 ≥ 2 x1.  The sender’s expected number of hires is P = (1/3)x2 + (2/3)x1.  This is largest when x2 = 1 and x1 is as high as the constraint allows.  If we set x1 = 0.5, p = 0.5 and HR is indifferent; to make HR strictly prefer hiring we back off a bit.  Choosing x1 = 0.49, x2 = 1 gives p ≈ 0.505, HR’s expected payoff ≈ 0.0066 > 0, so the HR’s strict best response under π1 is to hire whenever the professor recommends.  Expected hires for the professor are P ≈ 0.659 (≈ 66 %).  This is essentially the maximum while ensuring the HR cooperates.",

    "Analysis": "The HR will follow the signal only if doing so yields non‑negative expected utility. If HR hires only after signal 1, its payoff is (1/3)x2 − (2/3)x1. Thus HR will accept a signaling scheme with x2 > 2x1; then it hires for σ=1 and rejects for σ=0. The sender’s payoff equals the hiring probability P(σ=1)= (2/3)x1 + (1/3)x2, which is maximized subject to x2 > 2x1 and x2≤1 by taking x2 as large as possible (1) and x1 as close as possible to 0.5 while keeping the HR’s inequality strict. Choosing x1 = 0.49 and x2 = 1 gives HR an incentive (expected gain ≈0.0067) to follow the signals and yields the sender an expected hiring rate of ≈0.66—close to the theoretical maximum 2/3 but safely acceptable to HR.",

    "Analysis": "My objective is to maximize the total fraction of students that end up being hired. The HR will only hire on a signal σ if the posterior probability that the student is excellent exceeds 0.5, because its expected payoff from hiring is 2·Pr(excellent|σ) − 1.  \nLet x1 = Pr(σ = 1 | weak) and x2 = Pr(σ = 1 | excellent).  \nPosterior when σ = 1 is p1 = x2 / (x2 + 2x1).  \nWe need p1 > 0.5 ⇒ x2 > 2x1.  \nGiven that constraint, the expected fraction hired is (2/3)·x1 + (1/3)·x2, which is increasing in both x1 and x2.  \nThus we set x2 as large as possible (1) and x1 as large as possible subject to x2 > 2x1.  \nChoosing x1 = 0.499 and x2 = 1 gives p1 ≈ 0.501 > 0.5, so HR strictly prefers hiring on σ = 1 and rejecting on σ = 0.  \nHR’s expected payoff then is (1/3)·1 − (2/3)·0.499 ≈ 0.006 > 0, better than ignoring signals (payoff 0), so the HR will rationally adopt π₁ (hire on σ = 1, reject on σ = 0).  \nMy expected fraction hired is (2/3)·0.499 + (1/3) ≈ 0.666, the maximum attainable under rational HR behaviour.
