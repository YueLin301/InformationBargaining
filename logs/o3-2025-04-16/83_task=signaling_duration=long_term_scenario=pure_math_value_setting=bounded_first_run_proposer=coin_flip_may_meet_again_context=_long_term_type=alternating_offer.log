    "Analysis": "As the sender, my payoff is 1 whenever the receiver takes action 1 and 0 otherwise.  The receiver, however, only prefers action 1 when the posterior probability of state 1 is at least 0.5.  Let x1 = φ(σ=1|s=0) and x2 = φ(σ=1|s=1).  Under Bayes’ rule the receiver’s posterior after σ=1 is  P(s=1|σ=1) = x2 /(2x1 + x2).  To induce action 1 on σ=1 we need x2 ≥ 2x1.  Conversely, after σ=0 the posterior is (1‑x2)/(2(1‑x1)+1‑x2); to keep the receiver at action 0 for σ=0 we need 2x1 ‑ x2 < 1.  These two inequalities cannot hold simultaneously with strict equality, so the best I can do is have σ=1 trigger action 1 and σ=0 trigger action 0.  I maximize my own payoff by making σ=1 occur as often as possible while still satisfying x2 ≥ 2x1.  Setting x2 = 1 and choosing x1 as close to 0.5 as possible (but below) does this.  With x1 = 0.499 and x2 = 1 we get:\n• Posterior after σ=1: 1 / (2*0.499 + 1) ≈ 0.501 > 0.5 ⇒ receiver chooses action 1.\n• Posterior after σ=0: 0 ⇒ receiver chooses action 0.\nThus\n   E_sender = (2/3)*x1 + (1/3)*1 ≈ (2/3)*0.499 + 1/3 ≈ 0.666,\nwhich is essentially the maximum attainable (upper bound 2/3).  The receiver’s expected payoff is positive (≈0.002 per σ=1, overall ≈0.0013), so the receiver’s best response is indeed to follow the posterior rule π1.  Therefore the scheme (x1,x2) = (0.499, 1) is optimal for me and acceptable to the receiver.",

    "Analysis": "I always earn 1 when the receiver chooses action 1, irrespective of the real state. The receiver, however, earns +1 only in state 1 and –1 in state 0, so he will take action 1 only when his posterior Pr(state = 1 | σ) ≥ 1/2.  \nLet x1 = φ(σ=1 | s=0) and x2 = φ(σ=1 | s=1).  After observing σ=1 the receiver’s posterior is x2 /(x2 + 2 x1).  To make him choose a=1 on σ=1 we need x2 ≥ 2 x1 (strict > gives him a strictly positive gain).  For σ=0 we want him to choose a=0, which automatically holds if x2 ≥ 2 x1 and x2 ≤ 1.  \nWith y1=0, y2=1 the sender payoff is (2/3) x1 + (1/3) x2, while the receiver payoff is –(2/3) x1 + (1/3) x2.  To make the receiver strictly prefer using the signals over ignoring them (which gives him 0), we need –(2/3) x1 + (1/3) x2 > 0, i.e. x2 > 2 x1.  \nThe sender payoff is increasing in both x1 and x2, so I push x1 as high as possible subject to x2 > 2 x1 and x2 ≤ 1.  Choosing x2 = 1 and x1 just below 0.5 satisfies this.  With x1 = 0.499, x2 = 1 we get:  \n• Receiver posterior on σ=1: 1 / (1 + 2·0.499) ≈ 0.501 > 0.5 ⇒ he chooses a = 1.  \n• Receiver posterior on σ=0: 0 ⇒ he chooses a = 0.  \n• Receiver expected payoff ≈ –(2/3)·0.499 + (1/3)·1 ≈ +0.00033 > 0, so he strictly prefers following π₁ to ignoring the signal.  \n• Sender expected payoff ≈ (2/3)·0.499 + (1/3)·1 ≈ 0.666 – ε ≈ 0.6657, which is essentially the maximal attainable while keeping the receiver strictly better off.  Therefore (x1, x2) = (0.499, 1) is my optimal signaling scheme.",

Therefore, the receiver’s payoff difference between choosing action 1 and action 0 is positive (≈0.002) after σ=1 and negative (‑1) after σ=0. Hence the best‐response rule is to play a=1 when σ=1 and a=0 when σ=0. This maximises expected payoff E[r^j] = (1/3)·1·1 − (2/3)·0.499·1 ≈ 0.00067, which is strictly higher than any other mixed strategy.",

    "Analysis": "As the receiver‑proposer I may announce a signalling scheme φ1 that sets the minimum payoff (participation constraint) the sender must grant me in order for me to respond with the Bayesian best‑response rule π1. Otherwise I will ignore the signals (π0), yielding 0 to both players. \n\nLet φ be characterised by x1 = P(σ=1|s=0) and x2 = P(σ=1|s=1).  Under π1 I take action 1 on a signal σ whenever the posterior Pr(s=1|σ) ≥ 0.5.  This happens\n• for σ = 1 iff x2 ≥ 2 x1, producing receiver payoff UR = (x2 – 2 x1)/3;\n• for σ = 0 iff 2 x1 – x2 ≥ 1, producing UR = (2 x1 – x2 – 1)/3.\nThe sender’s payoff is simply the probability that I take action 1.\n\nMaximising my own payoff subject to incentive compatibility gives the unique optimum at x1 = 0, x2 = 1 (or symmetrically x1 = 1, x2 = 0).  With x1 = 0, x2 = 1 we obtain:\n• my expected payoff UR = 1/3 (> 0);\n• sender’s payoff UI = 1/3 (they gain whenever σ = 1, which occurs with probability 1/3).\nIf the sender deviates so that my payoff would fall below 1/3 I will switch to π0, giving both players 0.  Since 1/3 > 0, a rational sender strictly prefers to satisfy my constraint rather than face π0.  Hence announcing φ1 = (x1 = 0, x2 = 1) is optimal for me.\n\nTherefore I set φ1 with x1 = 0 and x2 = 1.",

    "Analysis": "My reward is 1 exactly when the receiver chooses action 1. The receiver prefers action 1 only if her posterior belief that the state is 1 is at least 0.5. Let x1=Pr(signal=1|state=0) and x2=Pr(signal=1|state=1). For signal 1 the receiver’s posterior is x2/(x2+2x1). Action 1 will be taken after signal 1 iff this posterior ≥0.5, i.e. x2 ≥ 2x1. Setting x2=1 (always send 1 in state 1) and choosing x1 just below 0.5 satisfies the inequality strictly, so the receiver will strictly prefer action 1 after signal 1 and action 0 after signal 0 (since posterior there is 0). With x1=0.499, x2=1 we get:\n• Pr(signal 1)= (2/3)*0.499 + (1/3)*1 ≈ 0.666 → sender’s expected payoff ≈0.666.\n• Receiver’s expected payoff is positive but very small (≈0.0013), so she has no incentive to deviate from the Bayesian best‑response rule (π₁). This is the best attainable payoff for me (supremum 2/3) while keeping the receiver’s best response in my favour.\nTherefore I commit to the signaling scheme x1=0.499, x2=1.",

 Now the proposer decides that x1=0.499 and x2=1.

    "Analysis": "As the receiver‑proposer I can impose a minimum acceptable expected payoff v.  If the sender’s scheme gives me at least v I will play the posterior‑best‑response rule π₁; otherwise I will ignore the signal (π₀) which yields 0.  When I best‑respond, only two patterns are feasible: either I act on σ = 1 (I₁ = 1, I₀ = 0) or on σ = 0 (I₁ = 0, I₀ = 1).  The former gives me E_r = (x₂ − 2x₁)/3 ≤ 0, so I gain nothing.  The latter gives E_r = (2x₁ − x₂ − 1)/3, which is positive whenever 2x₁ > 1 + x₂.  The sender’s payoff in that region is E_s = (3 − 2x₁ − x₂)/3, so the two payoffs satisfy E_r + E_s = (2/3)(1 − x₂).  Setting x₂ = 0 and x₁ = 1 (the extremal point of this region) maximises my own payoff to v* = 1/3 while still giving the sender a positive 1/3, which strictly dominates the zero they would obtain if no agreement is reached.  Any higher v would make x₁ > 1 and be infeasible, so v* = 1/3 is the largest enforceable receiver payoff.  Therefore I announce the scheme ϕ₁ with (x₁, x₂) = (1, 0) and will follow π₁ if the sender gives me at least that 1/3 payoff; otherwise I revert to π₀.",

If I give the receiver less than the 1/3 payoff that scheme would yield them, they will switch to pi0 (ignore signals) and always play action 0, which gives me 0.  To satisfy their threshold I must guarantee q1=1 (receiver chooses action 1 in state 1) and q0=0 (receiver chooses action 0 in state 0).  Any mixing of state 0 into the action‑1 signal would drop their payoff below 1/3 and trigger pi0.  The unique (up to relabeling) scheme that achieves this is full separation: send 0 in state 0 and 1 in state 1, i.e. x1=0, x2=1.  Under it the receiver follows pi1 with y1=0, y2=1, giving me expected payoff 1/3 (better than the 0 I get if they revert to pi0), so it is my strictly optimal response.",

    "Analysis": "As the sender I want the receiver to choose action 1 as often as possible, because I receive payoff 1 whenever a=1 (regardless of the state). The receiver, however, suffers –1 when the true state is 0 and gains +1 when the state is 1, so he will choose a=1 only if his posterior belief that the state is 1 is at least 0.5.\nLet x1 = Pr(σ=1 | s=0) and x2 = Pr(σ=1 | s=1).  For signal σ=1 the posterior is  P(s=1 | 1) = μ1 x2 / ( μ1 x2 + μ0 x1 ).  The receiver will pick a=1 after σ=1 iff this posterior ≥ 0.5, i.e.  x2 ≥ 2 x1.  For σ=0 the posterior is 0 when x2=1, so the receiver will surely pick a=0.  Thus with x2 ≥ 2 x1 =⇒ y2=1 and y1=0, my expected payoff becomes  (2/3) x1 + (1/3) x2.\nTo maximise that subject to x2≤1, we would like x1 as large as possible (≤0.5) and x2=1.  At x1=0.5 the receiver’s expected payoff is 0, the same as if he ignored my signals; he could therefore switch to always a=0 and leave me with zero.  So I must give him strictly positive surplus.  Choosing x1 slightly below 0.5 (say 0.49) and x2=1 keeps my payoff very close to 2/3 while giving the receiver a strictly positive expected gain ( (1/3)·1 – (2/3)·0.49 ≈ 0.0067 > 0 ), making π1 his unique best response.\nHence I commit to the signaling scheme σ=1 with probability 0.49 in state 0 and 1 in state 1.",

Hence action 1 after σ=0 yields –1 while action 0 yields 0, so best‑response is y1=0. For signal 1 we have Pr(state=1 | σ=1)= (1·1/3) / 0.66 ≈ 0.505 > 0.5, giving expected payoff of action 1 equal to 0.505−0.495≈0.010>0, while action 0 gives 0. Therefore the best response is y2=1. This maximises my expected payoff (≈0.0067), which is strictly higher than any other mixed choice.",

    "Analysis": "My goal is to maximize the probability that the receiver takes action 1, because I earn 1 whenever a = 1 and 0 otherwise.  The receiver will play a best‑response rule: for each signal he chooses a = 1 only if his posterior probability that the state is 1 is at least 0.5 (otherwise a = 0 gives non‑negative payoff while a = 1 would be negative).  \nLet x1 = Pr(σ=1|s=0) and x2 = Pr(σ=1|s=1).  With prior μ(s=0)=2/3, μ(s=1)=1/3, the posterior after σ=1 is\n    P(s=1 | σ=1) = (1/3·x2) / (1/3·x2 + 2/3·x1).\nFor the receiver to choose a = 1 after σ=1 we need  P(s=1|σ=1) ≥ 0.5, i.e.  x2 ≥ 2x1.\nTo maximize my own payoff I set x2 as large as possible (1) and push x1 as high as I can while keeping x2 ≥ 2x1.  The maximal feasible x1 is 0.5.  At x1 = 0.5 my expected payoff would be 2/3, but the receiver’s expected payoff would be exactly 0, giving him no strict preference between reacting to my signals or ignoring them.  To make sure the receiver strictly prefers to follow the informative rule (π1), I choose x1 just below 0.5.\nTake x1 = 0.49, x2 = 1.  Then\n  • P(s=1|σ=1) ≈ 0.506 > 0.5 → receiver best responds with a = 1 after σ=1.\n  • P(s=1|σ=0) = 0 → receiver best responds with a = 0 after σ=0.\nExpected payoffs:\n  • Sender: E[r^i] = Pr(σ=1) = (2/3)·0.49 + (1/3)·1 ≈ 0.659.\n  • Receiver: E[r^j] = (1−2·0.49)/3 ≈ 0.0067 > 0, strictly better than ignoring signals (0).\nThus the receiver will rationally adopt the posterior‑based rule π1, and I obtain the highest possible payoff while leaving him strictly better off than any alternative.\nTherefore I commit to the signaling scheme (x1, x2) = (0.49, 1).",

    "Analysis": "My payoff only depends on the receiver’s action: I get 1 if the receiver plays a = 1 and 0 otherwise. The receiver plays a = 1 when its posterior belief that the state is 1 exceeds 0.5, because its utility for a = 1 is -1 in state 0 and +1 in state 1. With prior μ0(0)=2/3 and μ0(1)=1/3, a signalling scheme φ must satisfy μ1 x2 > μ0 x1 (i.e. x2 > 2 x1) to make the posterior after σ = 1 above 0.5. To maximise the frequency of σ = 1 (and hence my expected reward) I set x2 as high as possible (1) and x1 as close to 0.5 as the strict inequality allows. Choosing x1 = 0.499, x2 = 1 gives: Pr(σ = 1) = (2/3)·0.499 + 1/3 ≈ 0.666, so my expected payoff ≈ 0.666. For σ = 1 the receiver’s posterior is 1 / (2·0.499 + 1) ≈ 0.501, giving it a strictly positive expected gain from a = 1; for σ = 0 the posterior is 0 so it prefers a = 0. Thus the receiver’s best‑response is π(σ=1)=1, π(σ=0)=0, and it is strictly better off (small positive expected gain) than ignoring signals, so it will comply. This scheme is optimal for me (cannot make both posteriors >0.5, and pushing x1 arbitrarily close to 0.5 lets my payoff approach the upper bound 2/3).",
    "Decision": [0.499, 1]

Proposal:
 Now the proposer decides that x1=0.499 and x2=1.

The maximal R that is simultaneously feasible (0≤x1,x2≤1 and x2>2x1) is obtained by solving x2 – 2x1 = 1 ⇒ x1=0, x2=1, which yields R=1/3.  No other feasible scheme can give me more than 1/3, so 1/3 is the highest enforceable threshold.  \nUnder (x1,x2)=(0,1) the sender’s expected payoff is also 1/3, strictly higher than the 0 they get if I revert to π0, so a rational sender will accept.  \nTherefore I announce the truthful scheme (0,1) as φ₁, committing to follow π1 if the sender adopts any scheme that gives me at least 1/3; otherwise I will ignore the signals (π0).",

    "Analysis": "If I choose any scheme that induces the receiver to ignore my signals (π₀), my payoff is 0. The receiver, acting rationally, will switch to π₁ only if the expected reward it gets from my scheme is at least as high as the 1/3 it would get under the reference scheme (x1=0, x2=1) it just proposed. Let q be the probability the receiver plays a=1 in state 0 and r the probability it plays a=1 in state 1. Receiver’s payoff constraint is –(2/3)q + (1/3)r ≥ 1/3, i.e. –2q + r ≥ 1. My payoff is (2/3)q + (1/3)r. Because r ≤ 1, this inequality forces q = 0 and r = 1; any q>0 would violate the receiver’s constraint. Hence the unique feasible way to give the receiver at least 1/3 is to ensure it plays a=1 only when the state is 1, and with probability 1. That corresponds exactly to x1 = 0, x2 = 1. Under this scheme my expected payoff is 1/3, the receiver’s is 1/3, and the receiver will indeed follow π₁. Any deviation gives me ≤ 1/3 or makes the receiver revert to π₀, yielding me 0. Therefore committing to (x1=0, x2=1) maximizes my expected payoff.",

    "Analysis": "I earn 1 whenever the receiver plays action 1.  The receiver plays action 1 after a signal σ iff the posterior Pr(s=1|σ) > 0.5.

My expected payoff is then Pr(σ=1) = (2/3)x1 + (1/3)x2.  Maximising this subject to x2 ≤ 1 yields x1 → 0.5, x2 = 1.  Choosing x1 = 0.499, x2 = 1 (so x2 > 2x1 holds strictly) gives expected payoff ≈ 2/3 for me and a small positive payoff for the receiver (≈0.0013), so the receiver will best‑respond as intended.

    "Analysis": "My outside option is to ignore all signals (pi_0); this yields 0 to both players, so any scheme the sender will voluntarily choose must give it strictly more than 0.  \nLet x1 = P(σ=1|s=0) and x2 = P(σ=1|s=1).  When I use Bayes‑optimal actions (pi_1) I take a=1 on a signal σ whenever the posterior P(s=1|σ) ≥ 0.5.  This gives the following regimes:\n  • If x2 ≥ 2x1 and 2x1+x2 < 1, I play a=1 on σ=1 only.  My payoff = (1/3)(x2−2x1) ≥ 0, the sender’s = (2/3)x1+(1/3)x2.\n  • Maximising the sender’s payoff under the constraint that my payoff ≥ 0 gives a constant sender payoff of 1/3 and my payoff up to 1/3, attained when (x1,x2) lies on the line x2 = 1−2x1 with x1 ≤ 0.25.\n  • The point (x1,x2) = (0,1) is such a scheme: I play a=1 only after σ=1, giving me 1/3 and the sender 1/3.\n  • No feasible signalling scheme can give me more than 1/3 (while still giving the sender ≥ 0).  Setting my acceptance threshold at 1/3 therefore maximises my expected payoff yet remains acceptable to the sender (since it still gets 1/3 > 0 vs. the 0 it would receive if I revert to pi_0).\nHence I announce φ_1 with (x1,x2) = (0,1) and commit to follow pi_1 if the sender delivers me at least 1/3; otherwise I will revert to pi_0.",

    "Analysis": "As the sender (agent 0) responding to the receiver–proposer’s request, I must choose a signalling scheme φ = (x1, x2).  The receiver promises to follow the Bayesian‐optimal rule π1 only if her expected payoff with my scheme is at least as high as the payoff she would obtain with the reference scheme she just proposed, namely (x1=0, x2=1), which gives her 1/3.  For any binary signalling scheme, the receiver’s expected payoff under π1 is (1/3)x2 – (2/3)x1.  To reach 1/3 we need x2 – 2x1 ≥ 1.  Because probabilities are bounded by 1, the unique feasible solution is x1 = 0, x2 = 1.  Any other scheme would give her less than 1/3, so she would switch to π0, in which case she always plays action 0 and my payoff would fall to 0.  Therefore the best (indeed the only) rational choice for me is to adopt the fully revealing scheme (0, 1), which yields my maximal obtainable expected payoff of 1/3 while satisfying the receiver’s participation constraint.",

    "Analysis": "As the receiver‑proposer I should announce the signalling scheme φ₁=(x₁,x₂) that maximises my own expected payoff while still giving the sender at least as much as he can get if I ignore all signals (π₀).  \nIf I ignore signals (π₀) I always play a=0, so the sender’s payoff is 0.  Hence the sender will accept any φ that gives him a positive expected payoff provided my announced ‘reservation payoff’ is attainable.  \nLet the sender use (x₁,x₂) and assume I will best‑respond to the posterior (π₁).  I then play a=1 after σ=1 iff P(s=1|σ=1)>½, i.e. iff x₂>2x₁.  In that case my expected payoff is\nE_r = (μ₀(0)x₁ + μ₀(1)x₂)·(x₂−2x₁)/(2x₁+x₂).\nRequiring E_r ≥ 1/3 (the maximum I can get) implies x₁=0 and x₂=1; any other pair gives me strictly less than 1/3.  With (0,1) I receive 1/3 and the sender receives 1/3, which strictly dominates his fallback payoff 0, so he will accept.  Therefore I announce φ₁ = (0,1).",

    "Analysis": "The receiver, acting as proposer, declared the reference scheme (x1=0, x2=1) and promised to follow the Bayesian best‑response policy π1 as long as the scheme we commit to gives her at least the same expected payoff she would get from that reference (which is 1/3).  \n\nIf we deviate and mix state‑0 into signal 1 (i.e. choose x1>0), the receiver’s expected payoff becomes 1/3 − (2/3)x1 and drops below 1/3 for any x1>0, so she would switch to π0 (ignore signals) and our payoff would fall to 0.  \n\nIf we keep x1=0 but lower x2<1, her expected payoff becomes (1/3)x2 ≤1/3, again triggering π0 and giving us 0.  \n\nHence the only feasible scheme that lets her stick to π1 and still meets her threshold is exactly x1=0, x2=1.  Under that scheme she plays action 1 only in state 1, giving us expected payoff 1·μ0(1)=1/3, which is strictly better than the 0 we would get if she ignored the signals.  \n\nTherefore our strictly payoff‑maximising response is to accept the proposed signalling scheme.",

    "Analysis": "My payoff is +1 when the true state is 1 and I act 1, –1 when the state is 0 and I act 1, and 0 otherwise.  With Bayesian best‑response I will take action 1 after a signal only if the posterior P(state=1|signal) ≥ 0.5.  For a generic signalling scheme (x1,x2)≡(Pr[σ=1|s=0],Pr[σ=1|s=1]), this means:\n  • After σ=1 I act 1 iff  x2 ≥ 2 x1.\n  • After σ=0 I act 1 iff  2 x1 – x2 ≥ 1.\nEvaluating my expected reward shows that the maximum I can ever obtain is 1⁄3, achieved (symmetrically) by either (x1,x2)=(0,1) or (1,0).  With (0,1) I would act 1 only after σ=1, yielding both players an expected payoff of 1⁄3.  Any other scheme gives me ≤1⁄3.  Therefore I announce (x1,x2)=(0,1) as the reference scheme: I commit to follow the Bayesian best response (π1) if the sender adopts any signalling rule that gives me at least this 1⁄3 payoff; otherwise I will ignore signals and always play action 0 (π0).  This maximises my expected payoff while still giving the sender a strictly positive incentive (1⁄3) to accept.",

With (x1=0,x2=1) and posterior best‑response (y1=0,y2=1) the receiver obtains 1/3, which is higher than the 0 it would obtain by ignoring my signals (pi0).  Any attempt to set x1>0 is bounded by x2≤1; the receiver‑payoff constraint −2x1+x2≥1 then forces x1=0.  Hence no alternative feasible scheme can keep the receiver at pi1 while giving me more than 1/3, and any scheme that violates the receiver’s 1/3 threshold makes it revert to pi0, giving me 0.  Therefore my payoff‑maximising response is to accept the proposed signalling scheme.",

    "Analysis": "As the sender I always profit (r=1) when the receiver chooses action 1, irrespective of the true state. I therefore want to design a signaling scheme that induces the receiver to take action 1 as often as possible while still being a best‑response for the receiver.\n\nLet x1=P(sigma=1|s=0) and x2=P(sigma=1|s=1).  After observing sigma=1 the receiver’s posterior of state 1 is p1 = (1/3·x2)/((2/3)·x1 + (1/3)·x2).  The receiver will choose action 1 iff p1>0.5, which simplifies to x2>2x1.  If this holds the receiver’s expected payoff from following the signal is E_r = (1/3)x2 − (2/3)x1 = (1−2x1)/3 ≥0, so he strictly prefers to respond to the signal rather than ignore it (π₁ dominates π₀) whenever x1<0.5.\n\nMy own expected payoff equals the probability that sigma=1 is sent (because then the receiver will play a=1): q1 = (2/3)·x1 + (1/3)·x2.  Subject to x2≤1 and x2>2x1, this is maximised by taking x2 as large as possible (1) and x1 as large as still feasible (just below 0.5).  Choosing x1=0.49, x2=1 gives\n  – Receiver posterior p1 ≈0.505>0.5 ⇒ receiver plays a=1 on sigma=1.\n  – My expected payoff q1 ≈0.666.\n  – Receiver payoff ≈0.0066≥0, so π₁ is preferred.\nNo other feasible (x1,x2) can raise q1 above 2/3, so this choice is essentially optimal for me.\n\nTherefore I commit to x1=0.49, x2=1.",

When σ=1, expected payoff of a=1 is 0.505·1 + 0.495·(−1) = 0.01 > 0 (payoff of a=0), so choose a=1 ⇒ y2=1. This maximizes my expected reward.",
