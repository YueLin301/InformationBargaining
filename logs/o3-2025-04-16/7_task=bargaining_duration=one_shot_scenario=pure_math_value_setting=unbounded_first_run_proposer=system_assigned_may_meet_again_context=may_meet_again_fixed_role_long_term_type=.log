    "Analysis": "A fully rational responder should accept any offer that gives them a non‑negative payoff, because rejecting leaves them with 0 as well. If I kept the whole pie (x = 1), the responder is indifferent between accepting and rejecting (both yield 0), so there is a non‑zero risk of rejection if they break ties unfavorably. By leaving an infinitesimal positive amount to the responder I strictly improve their payoff over rejection, making acceptance strictly better and driving the acceptance probability to 1. The cost to me is negligible. Therefore choosing x very close to 1 dominates choosing exactly x = 1.",

    "Analysis": "A fully rational, self‑interested responder prefers any strictly positive payoff to zero and is indifferent when the payoff is exactly zero. To guarantee acceptance and maximize my own payoff, I should leave the responder an arbitrarily small but positive amount. Choosing x extremely close to 1 satisfies both conditions: (1) the responder’s share is positive, so accepting strictly dominates rejecting; (2) my own share is maximized subject to acceptance. Therefore I set x = 0.9999 (leaving 0.0001 to the responder).",
    "Decision": 0.9999
}
Proposal:
 Now the proposer decides that x=0.9999.

    "Analysis": "Accepting gives me 0.0001 now (and likely the same tiny amount in any future round). Rejecting sacrifices 0.0001 this round but credibly signals that such low offers will be refused; in any future repetition the rational proposer would then offer me at least some non‑trivial share (e.g., 0.1) rather than risk another rejection. As long as the probability of a future round exceeds roughly 0.1 %, the expected gain from rejecting exceeds 0.0001. Since the problem states there might be future play and no bound is given on that probability, rejecting strictly dominates accepting for reasonable beliefs about repeat probability. Therefore I reject.",
