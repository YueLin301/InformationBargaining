With x2≤1, the only feasible solution is the fully separating, truthful scheme (x1=0, x2=1).  \nUnder it I obtain 1⁄3 (buy only good products) and the seller gets 1⁄3, which is better for her than getting 0 if I switch to ignoring signals.  \nThus the seller’s best response is to adopt (0,1), so I announce that scheme as the minimum acceptable one and commit to Bayesian best‑response thereafter.",

    "Analysis": "Buyer will only purchase when the posterior probability that the product is good is at least 0.5 (otherwise expected value of buying is negative).  Let x1 be the probability I send signal 1 for a bad product and x2 for a good product.  If the buyer uses the posterior‑optimal rule (pi1) and buys only on signal 1, his expected payoff is (1/3)x2 – (2/3)x1.  He will compare this with the 0 payoff from ignoring signals (pi0).  To make him strictly prefer following my signals we need (1/3)x2 – (2/3)x1 > 0  ⇒ x2 > 2x1.  His posterior on signal 1 is P(good|1)=x2/(x2+2x1); requiring it to be ≥0.5 gives the same inequality x2 ≥ 2x1.  My expected sales (and thus payoff) are (1/3)x2 + (2/3)x1.  Under the constraint x2 > 2x1 and 0≤x1,x2≤1, the best I can do is choose x2 = 1 and make x1 as large as possible but still strictly less than 0.5 so that x2 > 2x1 holds.  Taking x1 = 0.49 and x2 = 1 gives the buyer an expected gain of about 0.0067 > 0 (so he strictly prefers pi1) and gives me an expected payoff of about 0.66, higher than any truthful or pooling scheme that the buyer would accept.",

If the seller adopts any scheme φ that gives me an expected payoff at least as high as under φ1, I will play π1 (best‑response to the posterior); otherwise I revert to π0 (never buy).  \nUnder φ1 I buy only after signal 1, because P(s=1 | σ=1)=1 and P(s=1 | σ=0)=0.  My expected payoff is 1/3.  \nFor the seller to induce me to use π1 it must satisfy both the posterior condition x2 ≥ 2x1 and the threshold (1/3)x2 − (2/3)x1 ≥ 1/3, i.e. x2 − 2x1 ≥ 1.

This yields the seller an expected payoff of 1/3, which is better than the 0 it would receive if I switch to π0.  Hence the seller will comply.\nTherefore φ1 = (0,1) maximises my enforceable payoff and is credible.",

    "Analysis": "As the receiver (buyer) and proposer, I can commit to the following rule: I will play the Bayesian best‑response (pi_1) if the seller chooses a signalling scheme that gives me at least a certain expected payoff Ū; otherwise I will ignore the signal (pi_0) and never buy, which yields the seller 0.  \nGiven any scheme (x1,x2) and my best‑response rule, I buy after a signal σ=1 only when the posterior probability of good quality exceeds 1/2.  Setting x2=1 and x1∈[0,0.5) achieves this.  My expected payoff is\nU(x1)=((2/3)x1+1/3)*(1−2x1)/(2x1+1),\nwhich is maximised at x1=0, giving U_max = 1/3.  \nIf I set the acceptance threshold Ū = 1/3 and propose the scheme (x1=0, x2=1), then:\n• My expected payoff is 1/3 (I buy only the 1/3 truly good products and gain +1 each).\n• The seller’s expected payoff is also 1/3 (they sell exactly the good products), strictly better than the 0 they would get if I switched to pi_0.\n• Any deviation by the seller that raises their sales above 1/3 necessarily lowers my payoff below 1/3, causing me to revert to pi_0, so the seller is strictly best‑responding by adopting the proposed scheme.\nThus (x1=0, x2=1) is the most favourable enforceable scheme for me, guarantees positive utility for the seller, and is incentive‑compatible for both sides.",

    "Analysis": "As the seller I want the buyer to purchase as often as possible, but the buyer will only purchase when their posterior probability that the product is good exceeds 0.5.  Let x1=Pr(signal=1|bad) and x2=Pr(signal=1|good).  If the buyer uses Bayes’ rule, they will buy on signal 1 iff (1/3)x2 > (2/3)x1, and buy on signal 0 iff (1/3)(1−x2) > (2/3)(1−x1).  Both inequalities cannot hold simultaneously, so the best I can do is make the buyer buy on exactly one signal.  To maximize the overall frequency of purchases I should maximise Pr(signal = 1)= (2/3)x1 + (1/3)x2 subject to (1/3)x2 > (2/3)x1.  Setting x2 as high as possible (1) and x1 as close to 0.5 as the strict inequality allows gives an expected sales rate arbitrarily close to 2/3.  Choosing x1 = 0.49, x2 = 1 makes the posterior after signal 1 equal to 0.505 (>0.5), so the buyer strictly prefers to buy on 1.  The posterior after signal 0 is about 0.20 (<0.5), so the buyer will not buy on 0.  Their expected payoff is positive (≈0.01 per round), so they will indeed follow π1.  My expected payoff is Pr(buy)= (2/3)*0.49 + (1/3)*1 ≈ 0.66, which is the highest I can guarantee.  Any deviation lowers this probability or risks the buyer’s refusal to purchase.",

    "Analysis": "I want the buyer to purchase whenever I label a product as 1. The buyer will do so only if the posterior probability that the product is good given signal 1 exceeds 0.5. Setting x2 = 1 (always recommend good items) and x1 just below 0.5 makes that posterior slightly above 0.5, so the buyer rationally buys after signal 1 and never buys after signal 0. With x1 = 0.49 the posterior P(good | σ=1) ≈ 0.333 / (0.667*0.49 + 0.333) ≈ 0.505 > 0.5, so the buyer’s best‑response is y2 = 1, y1 = 0. My expected sale probability is then (2/3)*0.49 + (1/3)*1 ≈ 0.66, giving me an expected payoff ≈ 0.66, strictly higher than the 1/3 I would get with truthful separation and higher than any other feasible scheme. Hence (x1, x2) = (0.49, 1) is optimal for me.",

    "Analysis": "My payoff (1 per purchase) is maximised when the buyer purchases as often as possible. With any signalling scheme the buyer will buy after a signal only if the posterior probability of good quality exceeds 0.5. Let x1 = P(signal = 1 | bad) and x2 = P(signal = 1 | good). For the buyer to buy on signal 1 we need x2 / (x2 + 2 x1) > 0.5, i.e. x2 ≥ 2 x1. The probability that signal 1 occurs (and therefore that I sell) is 1/3·x2 + 2/3·x1. This expression is maximised by pushing x2 to its upper bound 1 and x1 as high as is still allowed, i.e. just below 0.5. Choosing x1 = 0.499 and x2 = 1 makes the posterior after signal 1 about 0.501 (>0.5 so the buyer buys) while keeping sales probability ≈ 0.666, close to the theoretical maximum 2/3. After signal 0 the posterior is 0, so the buyer will not buy, satisfying rationality. No other feasible (x1,x2) pair can give a higher expected number of sales, so this scheme is optimal for me.",

 Now the proposer decides that x1=0.499 and x2=1.

    "Analysis": "My payoff equals the probability that the buyer purchases.  The buyer will purchase after a signal only if his posterior belief that the product is good exceeds 0.5, because his expected gain from buying is 2p−1.  Let x1 be the probability I send the favourable signal 1 when the product is bad, and x2 when it is good.  The posterior after signal 1 is p = (1/3)x2 / ((1/3)x2 + (2/3)x1) = x2 / (x2 + 2x1).  To make the buyer buy we need x2 > 2x1.  His ex‑ante expected payoff when he follows the posterior‑best‑response rule (buy on 1, reject on 0) is (1/3)x2 − (2/3)x1, which is also non‑negative exactly when x2 ≥ 2x1.  Thus any scheme with x2 > 2x1 leaves him at least as well off as ignoring signals, so he will follow it and buy on signal 1.  My expected sales probability is (1/3)x2 + (2/3)x1.  Subject to x2 > 2x1 and x2 ≤ 1, this is maximised by setting x2 = 1 and choosing x1 as close to 0.5 as possible from below.  Taking x1 = 0.499 satisfies x2 > 2x1 (1 > 0.998) and yields expected sales ≈ 1/3 + 2/3·0.499 ≈ 0.666, i.e. two thirds of the time, while giving the buyer a strictly positive expected payoff ≈ 0.006 so he prefers to use the posterior rule.  No other feasible signalling scheme can give me a higher expected payoff.",

    "Analysis": "I want the buyer to purchase whenever possible. The buyer will best–respond by buying only when the posterior probability that the product is good exceeds 0.5. If I always recommend good products (s=1) and recommend bad products (s=0) with probability x1, then a recommendation signal (σ=1) is received with probability (2/3)x1 + 1/3. The posterior that the product is good after σ=1 is 1 / (2x1 + 1). To make the buyer strictly prefer buying on σ=1, I need 1 / (2x1 + 1) > 0.5 → x1 < 0.5. Setting x1 very close to 0.5 maximizes my sales while keeping the buyer’s incentive strict. Choosing x1 = 0.49 and x2 = 1 gives:  • Posterior good on σ=1 ≈ 0.505 > 0.5, so the buyer buys on σ=1.  • The buyer refuses on σ=0.  • I sell every good product and 49 % of bad ones, for a sale probability 1/3 + (2/3)·0.49 ≈ 0.66 and the same expected payoff. No other feasible scheme can yield more than 2/3 sales, and this is arbitrarily close to that upper bound while preserving the buyer’s strict incentive to buy on σ=1.

    "Analysis": "Our payoff under any signaling scheme (x1,x2) with the Bayesian best‑response rule is E_r^j = (x2 − 2 x1)/3, while the seller’s payoff is (x2 + 2 x1)/3.  A buy decision on signal 1 is optimal for us iff x2 > 2 x1.  To maximize our own payoff we want x1 as small and x2 as large as possible, i.e. x1 = 0, x2 = 1, which gives us the maximal attainable expected reward 1/3 and gives the seller 1/3.  We therefore announce the threshold 1/3 and state that we will follow the Bayesian best response (buy on σ = 1, reject on σ = 0) whenever the sender’s scheme yields us at least 1/3; otherwise we ignore signals and never buy, giving the seller 0.  The only scheme that satisfies the threshold is the fully separating one (x1 = 0, x2 = 1), so a rational seller will adopt it.",
