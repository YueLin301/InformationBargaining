Rejecting yields it 0, while accepting an offer where 1−x > 0 yields a strictly positive amount. Therefore it will accept any offer with x < 1 and may be indifferent at x = 1. To eliminate any possibility of rejection due to indifference while keeping my own payoff nearly maximal, I offer an infinitesimal positive amount to the responder. Choosing x = 0.999 ensures the responder gets 0.001, guaranteeing acceptance and giving me an expected payoff of 0.999, which is higher than any offer that risks rejection.",

    "Analysis": "As the proposer, I aim to maximize my own payoff. The responder receives (1‑x) if they accept and 0 if they reject. A self‑interested rational responder will accept any offer that gives them a strictly positive amount, because that is strictly better than rejecting and getting 0. Therefore, by offering the responder an arbitrarily small positive share, I can practically guarantee acceptance while retaining almost the entire pie. Choosing x = 0.9999 leaves the responder 0.0001, a strictly positive payoff, so acceptance is the dominant action for them. This sacrifices only 0.0001 of my maximum possible payoff while virtually ensuring the deal is accepted, maximizing my expected utility.",
