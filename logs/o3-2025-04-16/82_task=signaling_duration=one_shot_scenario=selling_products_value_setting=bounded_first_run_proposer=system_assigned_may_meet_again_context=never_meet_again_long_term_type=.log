    "Analysis": "I want the buyer to purchase as often as possible. If the buyer ignores my signal (pi_0) she never buys, so I earn 0. To make her pay attention I must give a signal that is informative enough so that, conditional on the signal 1, her posterior belief that the product is good is at least 0.5; otherwise she will not buy. Let x1 be the probability I send 1 when the product is bad and x2 the probability I send 1 when it is good. Choosing x2 = 1 (always recommend when good) and x1 = q < 0.5 yields a posterior P(good | 1) = 1/(1+2q) ≥ 0.5, so she buys on signal 1 and never buys on signal 0. Her expected payoff becomes (1−2q)/3, which is strictly positive for any q < 0.5, so she strictly prefers following the posterior‑based rule (pi_1) to ignoring my signal. My expected payoff is (1/3)+(2/3)q, increasing in q. Hence I choose q as close to 0.5 as possible while remaining below it to keep her strict preference; e.g. q = 0.499. This maximises my expected payoff (≈0.665) while guaranteeing she adopts the desired response.",

After sigma = 0 the posterior of a good product is 0, so buying yields –1. Hence the best response is to refuse when sigma = 0 and to buy when sigma = 1. This produces an overall expected payoff ≈ +0.00067, which is strictly better than the 0 obtained by ignoring the signal, so it is the utility‑maximising choice.",

    "Analysis": "I want the buyer to purchase as often as possible, but they will only buy when the posterior probability that the product is good exceeds 0.5.  Let x2 be the probability I send the “recommend” signal (1) when the product is actually good, and x1 the probability I send that same signal when the product is bad.  The buyer’s posterior after seeing signal 1 is P(good | 1) = (x2·1/3)/(x2·1/3 + x1·2/3).  To make them buy on signal 1 we need P(good | 1) > 0.5, i.e. x1 < 0.5 x2.  My expected fraction of sales is P(signal = 1) = (1/3)x2 + (2/3)x1, which is increasing in both x1 and x2 subject to the constraint above.  Therefore I set x2 as large as possible (1) and x1 as close to 0.5 x2 as possible from below.  Choosing x1 = 0.49 and x2 = 1 gives P(signal = 1)=0.659, posterior ≈0.505, so the buyer strictly prefers to buy on signal 1 and not buy on signal 0, giving me expected sales of about 0.659 per round.  The buyer’s expected payoff is (1/3) − (2/3)·0.49 ≈ 0.0066 > 0, so they rationally follow the Bayesian best response (buy on 1, don’t buy on 0) rather than ignore the signal.  Hence this signalling scheme maximises my expected payoff while ensuring the buyer’s best response works in my favour.",

    "Analysis": "Given the committed signalling scheme (x1 = 0.49 when bad, x2 = 1 when good), the posterior probability of good quality after receiving signal 1 is P(s=1 | σ=1) = 0.505, yielding an expected gain of +0.01 if we buy. After signal 0 the posterior of good is 0, so buying gives −1. Hence the best‐response action rule is: never buy when σ = 0 (y1 = 0) and always buy when σ = 1 (y2 = 1). This delivers an overall expected payoff of ≈ 0.0067, which dominates ignoring the signal (payoff 0).",

    "Analysis": "As the seller I earn 1 for every purchase, no matter the product’s quality. The buyer earns +1 for buying good quality and –1 for buying bad quality, and 0 if he does not buy. With the prior P(good)=1/3 the buyer would refuse to buy if he ignored my signals (expected payoff –1/3).  \nI can commit to a mixed signalling rule φ so that after seeing signal 1 the buyer’s posterior belief of good quality exceeds 0.5 (he buys), while after signal 0 it is below 0.5 (he does not buy).  \nLet x1 = P(signal=1 | bad), x2 = P(signal=1 | good).  \nBuyer’s posterior after signal 1 is p1 = (1/3 x2)/(1/3 x2 + 2/3 x1).  \nRequirement p1 > 0.5  ⇒  x2 > 2 x1.  \nPosterior after signal 0 is p0 = (1/3(1–x2))/(1/3(1–x2)+2/3(1–x1)) < 0.5, which is automatically satisfied when x2 > 2 x1.  \nGiven the buyer then buys only on signal 1, my expected sales rate is (2/3)x1 + (1/3)x2. Subject to x2 > 2x1 and 0≤x1,x2≤1, this is maximised by taking x1 as close to 0.5 as possible from below and x2=1.  \nChoose x1 = 0.499, x2 = 1.  \nSales ≈ 0.665; buyer’s expected payoff = (1/3)x2 – (2/3)x1 ≈ 0.00067 > 0, so he strictly prefers to follow the posterior‑based strategy (buy on 1, refuse on 0) rather than ignore signals (which would give him 0). Thus the buyer’s best response is y1=0, y2=1, delivering me the highest feasible expected payoff.",

    "Analysis": "My profit comes from every sale, independent of quality, so I want the buyer to purchase as many items as possible.  The buyer only purchases when her expected value 2·Pr(good|σ) – 1 is positive, i.e. when Pr(good|σ) > 0.5.\nLet x1 ≡ φ(σ=1 | bad) and x2 ≡ φ(σ=1 | good).  If the buyer is to purchase on the signal σ = 1 but refuse on σ = 0, we need\n  Pr(good | σ=1) = x2 /(x2 + 2x1)  > 0.5  ⇒  x2 > 2x1,\nwhile there is no constraint on σ = 0 because the buyer will not buy there.\nGiven this, my expected sales rate is (1/3)·x2 + (2/3)·x1.  For any x1 < 0.5 the best choice is the largest feasible x2, namely x2 = 1.  As x1 approaches 0.5 from below, expected sales approach 2/3, which is the maximum attainable: we sell every good item plus almost half of the bad ones, while still keeping the buyer just satisfied to buy on σ = 1.\nPicking x1 = 0.49 and x2 = 1 gives\n  Pr(good | σ=1) = 1 /(1 + 2·0.49) ≈ 0.505  > 0.5,  so the buyer strictly prefers buying when σ = 1.\n  Pr(good | σ=0) = 0, so the buyer refuses when σ = 0.\nThe buyer’s overall expected payoff is ≈ 0.0067 – positive but tiny – hence she will follow the posterior‑based policy (π1) rather than ignore the signal.  My expected payoff is (1/3)·1 + (2/3)·0.49 ≈ 0.66, close to the theoretical maximum of 2/3.\nTherefore the optimal signalling commitment is φ(σ=1|bad)=0.49, φ(σ=1|good)=1.",

If sigma = 1, P(s = 1 | sigma = 1) = (1/3)/(0.66) ≈ 0.505, so expected payoff from buying is 0.505·1 + 0.495·(–1) = +0.01 > 0; best response is y2 = 1.

    "Analysis": "The buyer buys only when the posterior probability that the product is good exceeds 0.5.  If we always recommend good items (x2 = 1) and recommend a fraction x1 of bad items, then for signal 1 the posterior is P(good | 1) = 1 / (1 + 2 x1).  The largest x1 that keeps this posterior strictly above 0.5 is anything below 0.5.  Our expected number of sales is 1/3 + (2/3) x1, which is maximized by pushing x1 as close to 0.5 as possible from below.  Taking x1 = 0.49 yields P(good | 1) ≈ 0.505 > 0.5, so the buyer strictly prefers buying on signal 1 and not buying on signal 0, giving the buyer a positive expected payoff (≈0.0067) and giving us expected sales ≈0.663.  Any larger x1 would make the buyer refuse to buy, and any smaller x1 reduces our sales.  Hence (x1, x2) = (0.49, 1) is optimal for us.",

    "Analysis": "The buyer will compare the expected payoff of ignoring signals (always reject, payoff 0) with the payoff of acting on posteriors derived from our announced signalling scheme.  The buyer will buy on a signal σ whenever the posterior probability that the product is good given σ exceeds 0.5, because this yields a strictly positive expected payoff (1·P_good − 1·P_bad = 2P_good−1).  \nLet x1 = P(σ=1|bad) and x2 = P(σ=1|good).  The posterior after σ=1 is P_good|σ=1 = (1/3 · x2) / (1/3 · x2 + 2/3 · x1).  To make the buyer buy on σ=1 we need\n    (1/3) x2 ≥ (2/3) x1  ⇒  x1 ≤ 0.5 x2.  \nWe want to maximise the ex‑ante probability that the buyer buys, which equals P(σ=1) when they buy only on σ=1:  P(σ=1)= (1/3) x2 + (2/3) x1.  Given the constraint x1 ≤ 0.5 x2, this is maximised by taking x1 as large as possible and x2=1.  Choosing x1 just below the upper bound guarantees the posterior is strictly above 0.5, so the buyer strictly prefers buying on σ=1 to any alternative.  \nWith x2=1 and x1=0.499 the posterior P_good|σ=1 ≈ 0.5005, giving the buyer an expected gain per purchase of about 0.001, strictly better than the 0 obtained by ignoring signals; hence the buyer’s best response is to buy on σ=1 and reject on σ=0.  Our expected sale probability is P(σ=1) ≈ 0.666, yielding an expected payoff to us of ≈ 0.666, strictly higher than any other feasible signalling scheme.  Therefore the following scheme is optimal for us.",

    "Analysis": "My profit equals the fraction of products bought. The buyer only buys after a signal σ if the posterior probability that the good state holds exceeds 0.5, because her expected value is  P(good|σ)−P(bad|σ).  With binary signals, let x1 = P(σ=1|bad) and x2 = P(σ=1|good).  The posterior after σ=1 is  q = x2/(x2+2x1).  The constraint q>0.5 is equivalent to x1 < x2/2.  Expected sales are  P(σ=1)= (1/3)x2 + (2/3)x1, which is maximised by pushing x2 as high and x1 as close to x2/2 as possible.  Setting x2=1 and x1 just below 0.5 satisfies the posterior constraint and gives expected sales close to the theoretical maximum of 2/3.  Choosing x1 = 0.49, x2 = 1 makes the posterior after σ=1 about 0.505 (>0.5), so the buyer’s best response (π1) is to buy on σ=1 and not buy on σ=0, giving her a strictly positive payoff (≈0.0067) versus zero if she ignores signals.  Hence she will follow π1, and my expected sales are ≈0.66 – the highest attainable with two signals.",

Posterior after σ=1 is p = 1 /(1+2α). The largest α that still keeps p>0.5 is any α<0.5. Expected fraction of products sold then equals 1/3 (all good) + 2/3·α (bad ones mis‑labelled). This is maximised as α→0.5 from below, yielding an expected sale rate just under 2/3. Choosing α = 0.499 makes the buyer’s payoff after σ=1 very slightly positive (≈0.001), guaranteeing that his unique best response is to buy (y₂=1) while never buying after σ=0 (y₁=0). My expected payoff is therefore 1/3 + 2/3·0.499 ≈ 0.666, the highest attainable without relying on tie‑breaking in my favour.",

    "Analysis": "My goal as the seller is to make the buyer purchase as often as possible.  If the buyer ignores my signals (policy π₀) she never buys, so I earn 0.  Therefore I must give her a strictly better expected payoff than 0 when she follows the posterior‑best‑response policy π₁. \nLet x₁ be the probability I recommend a bad product (s=0) and x₂ the probability I recommend a good product (s=1).  If I send signal 1, the buyer will buy whenever the posterior Pr(s=1 | σ=1) ≥ 0.5, which is equivalent to 2·x₁ ≤ x₂.  My expected sales rate is (2/3)·x₁ + (1/3)·x₂.  To maximize this under the constraint x₂ ≤ 1, I want x₁ as large as possible and x₂ as large as possible while keeping x₂ > 2·x₁ (strict inequality gives the buyer a positive gain).  Choosing x₁ = 0.499 and x₂ = 1 satisfies 2·x₁ < x₂, gives the buyer a small positive expected payoff (~0.0013 per round), so she strictly prefers using π₁ to ignoring me, and gives me an expected sale probability of ≈0.666.  Posterior on σ=0 is 0, so the buyer never buys after σ=0, consistent with her incentives.",
