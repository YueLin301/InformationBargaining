The responder will accept any offer where its payoff (1â€‘x) is strictly greater than 0, because that strictly dominates rejection.

To ensure strict acceptance while keeping almost the entire pie, I should offer the smallest positive amount possible to the responder.

Offering x = 0.999 gives me 0.999 (almost the maximum possible) and guarantees the responder a positive payoff of 0.001, so it will certainly accept.
