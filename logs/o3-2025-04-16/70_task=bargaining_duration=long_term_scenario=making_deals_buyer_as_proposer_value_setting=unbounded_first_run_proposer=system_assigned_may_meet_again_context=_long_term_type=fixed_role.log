The responder will accept any offer where its payoff (1‑x) is strictly greater than 0, because that strictly dominates rejection. If 1‑x = 0 (i.e., x = 1), the responder is indifferent and may reject, giving me an expected payoff that could be 0. To ensure strict acceptance while keeping almost the entire pie, I should offer the smallest positive amount possible to the responder. A practical real number close to 1 is x = 0.999, giving the responder 0.001, which it strictly prefers to 0. Hence acceptance is guaranteed and my payoff is maximized.",

To avoid any risk of indifference leading to rejection, I should leave the responder a tiny positive amount while keeping almost everything for myself. Offering x = 0.999 gives me 0.999 (almost the maximum possible) and guarantees the responder a positive payoff of 0.001, so it will certainly accept. This strictly dominates proposing x = 1, whose acceptance is uncertain, and dominates any smaller x because it gives me less. Hence x = 0.999 maximizes my expected payoff.",
