If I offer x = 0.5 the responder’s payoff is 0, so they may accept or reject (they are indifferent). To avoid any chance of rejection, I should offer the largest x that still leaves the responder a tiny positive amount. Choosing x = 0.499999 guarantees acceptance while reducing my payoff by an imperceptible amount (≈6.7 × 10⁻⁷) compared with x = 0.5.
