    "Analysis": "My payoff (1+2x)/3 increases monotonically with x, while the responder will accept any offer that gives them a strictly positive payoff ( (1-2x)/3 > 0 ). At x = 0.5 the responder’s payoff is 0, so they may be indifferent and could reject. To guarantee acceptance while getting as much as possible, I offer a price infinitesimally below 0.5. Choosing x = 0.499 leaves the responder a small positive payoff (≈0.00067) so acceptance is strictly better for them than rejection, while my own payoff is maximised (≈0.666). This dominates any lower x for me and is acceptable for the responder.",

Picking x = 0.499 gives me ≈0.666 and the responder ≈0.00067, ensuring they strictly prefer acceptance while leaving me essentially the maximum possible payoff.",
