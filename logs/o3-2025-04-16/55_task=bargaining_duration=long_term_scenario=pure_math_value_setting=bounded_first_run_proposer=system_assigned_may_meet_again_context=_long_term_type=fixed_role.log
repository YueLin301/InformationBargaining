    "Analysis": "Backward induction shows that in the final (t = 4) round I can secure almost 2/3 for myself by setting x extremely close to 0.5; the responder then receives a tiny but strictly positive payoff and therefore accepts. Knowing this, in every earlier round the responder will accept any offer that gives at least that same tiny positive amount, while I want the highest x that is still strictly acceptable. Choosing x = 0.49 gives me (1 + 2·0.49)/3 ≈ 0.66 and gives the responder (1 − 2·0.49)/3 ≈ 0.0067, strictly better than rejection and no worse than what they can expect later. This maximises my expected payoff while keeping acceptance virtually certain.",

{
    "Analysis": "My goal is to maximize my own payoff. If the offer is accepted, my payoff is (1+2x)/3, which is increasing in x over the allowed range 0≤x≤0.5. Hence my best‑possible payoff occurs at x = 0.5, giving me 2/3. Because the responder is rational and self‑interested, rejecting an offer yields 0, while accepting any feasible offer yields (1−2x)/3 ≥ 0. Therefore, sooner or later the responder will accept some offer; at the final timestep they certainly will, because 0 is the only alternative. Since there is no discounting, repeatedly proposing x = 0.5 never leaves me worse off than making any smaller offer, and it can never increase the responder’s willingness to accept beyond certainty in the final round. Consequently, x = 0.5 maximizes my expected payoff in every subgame-perfect equilibrium. I therefore propose x = 0.5 again.",

    "Analysis": "My payoff if the offer is accepted is (1+2x)/3, strictly increasing in x. The responder will accept any offer that gives them a strictly positive payoff, since rejecting leaves them 0 and there is no guarantee I will improve the offer later. Offering x = 0.5 gave them 0, so they rationally rejected twice. If I now offer a value just below 0.5, say x = 0.499, the responder’s payoff becomes (1‑2·0.499)/3 ≈ 0.000667 > 0, strictly better than rejection, while my payoff is (1+2·0.499)/3 ≈ 0.666. Because there is no further strategic benefit for the responder to delay (future offers need not be better), they should accept. This maximizes my expected payoff among all offers that will be accepted.",
