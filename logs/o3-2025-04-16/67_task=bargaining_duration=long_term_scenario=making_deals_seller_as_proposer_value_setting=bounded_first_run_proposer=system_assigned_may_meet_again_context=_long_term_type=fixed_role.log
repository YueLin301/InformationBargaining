    "Analysis": "I want to maximise my own payoff ( (1+2x)/3 ) while ensuring the responder prefers accepting now to holding out for a (slightly) better deal or risking getting nothing by the deadline. Backward induction shows that in the final round I could demand x=0.5; any earlier round I can demand just under 0.5 and the responder should accept because (i) they obtain a small but positive payoff now, (ii) rejecting cannot get them more than a very small increase later and may leave them with zero in the last step. To guarantee acceptance while losing only a tiny amount of payoff compared with x=0.5, I set x = 0.49. My payoff becomes (1+2*0.49)/3 ≈ 0.66 and the responder gets (1-2*0.49)/3 ≈ 0.0033, which is positive so they should rationally accept.",

With x = 0.499 I obtain (1+2*0.499)/3 ≈ 0.666, while the responder still gets a (tiny) positive payoff, so acceptance is strictly better for it than rejection.

However, offering less than 0.5 now would lower my own eventual payoff (from 2/3 to something slightly smaller) without any compensating benefit because there is no discounting. Hence the strategy that maximizes my expected payoff at this stage is to stick with x = 0.5 again and concede only in the final round if needed.",

My own payoff rises with x, so I should offer the largest x that still leaves the responder a strictly positive (but arbitrarily small) payoff to secure acceptance.

In the final (5th) round the responder will accept any offer with non‑negative payoff because rejecting yields 0. Knowing I will never lower the offer, the responder’s expected future payoff from rejecting is at best the same or lower. Therefore the responder should accept any current offer that gives it a positive payoff. To maximise my own payoff while giving the responder a strictly positive amount and avoiding possible tie‑breaking rejection at x = 0.5, I propose x = 0.499.",
