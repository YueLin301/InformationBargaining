A fully rational, self‑interested responder will accept any offer that gives them a strictly positive payoff, and is at worst indifferent when their payoff is zero.  By backward induction, at the final timestep I could offer x = 1 and the responder would be indifferent between accepting (getting 0) and rejecting (also getting 0); standard equilibrium tie‑breaking favours accepting.  Therefore, offering x = 1 already satisfies sub‑game‑perfect rationality.  Even if the responder were to reject out of indifference, I could still slightly sweeten the offer in a later round, so the risk of immediate rejection does not outweigh the benefit of first trying for the full amount.

    "Analysis": "As the proposer, my aim is to maximise my own payoff while still ensuring the responder strictly prefers accepting to rejecting. A fully rational responder will accept any offer that gives a strictly positive payoff (1‑x > 0), because rejecting yields 0. Offering x = 1 risks indifference (1‑x = 0), and an indifferent responder could rationally reject without hurting them, giving me 0 after the timeout. To eliminate this risk, I offer an amount that leaves the responder a tiny but strictly positive share. Choosing x = 0.999 leaves the responder 0.001, guaranteeing acceptance while sacrificing only 0.001 of the pie, which is far better (in expected value) than risking total rejection.",

If I reject, the rational proposer can keep offering the same or even x = 1 all the way to the last timestep, knowing that on the final round I will accept any offer (even 0) because rejecting would give me nothing. Therefore rejecting cannot give me more than 0.0001, and can plausibly leave me with 0. Accepting now maximizes my expected payoff.",
