    "Analysis": "As the receiver‐proposer I can guarantee myself 0 by ignoring all signals (π₀ = never hire).  A signalling scheme that gives me a higher payoff must let me hire only when the posterior probability of excellence exceeds 0.5.  The honest (separating) scheme φ₁ with x₁ = 0, x₂ = 1 does exactly this: after σ = 1 the posterior is 1, so I hire and gain +1; after σ = 0 the posterior is 0, so I do not hire and obtain 0.  My resulting expected reward is 1/3, the maximum attainable because only one‑third of graduates are excellent.  The professor also hires every excellent student (1/3 of the mass), which is the highest hire rate he can secure under any scheme that still keeps my expected reward at least 1/3.  If the professor deviates to any other scheme that lowers my expected reward below 1/3, I will revert to π₀ and he will get 0 hires, so he is incentivised to accept φ₁.  Therefore I announce the separating scheme φ₁: send σ = 1 for excellent (s = 1) and σ = 0 for weak (s = 0).",

Any deviation that sends signal 1 to any weak student (x1>0) or withholds the signal from any excellent student (x2<1) would lower the receiver’s expected payoff below 1/3, in which case the receiver would switch to pi0 and hire nobody, leaving us with zero reward.  Therefore our unique payoff‑maximising response is to adopt exactly the proposed scheme, which yields us an expected payoff of 1/3 (all excellent students hired) while satisfying the receiver’s threshold.",

    "Analysis": "To maximize my expected number of hires I want the HR to hire after one of the signals.  The HR hires when its posterior Pr(excellent | σ) > 0.5.  Let x1 = Pr(σ=1 | weak) and x2 = Pr(σ=1 | excellent).  Posterior after σ=1 is x2 / (x2 + 2x1); the HR will hire iff x1 < 0.5 x2.  Expected hires are (2/3)x1 + (1/3)x2.  This is maximized by taking x2 = 1 and pushing x1 up to but not reaching 0.5.  Choose x1 = 0.49, x2 = 1.  Then posterior after σ=1 is 1 / (1 + 0.98) ≈ 0.505 > 0.5, so the HR’s best response is to hire on σ=1 and not hire on σ=0.  My expected hire rate is (2/3)(0.49) + (1/3)(1) ≈ 0.66, the maximum attainable.  The HR’s expected payoff is positive (~0.0066) so it has no incentive to deviate.

    "Analysis": "My goal as the professor (sender) is to maximise the expected number of students hired. The HR (receiver) will only hire after a signal σ if the posterior probability that the student is excellent exceeds 0.5, because her expected payoff from hiring is 2·P(excellent|σ)−1.  \nLet x1 = P(σ=1 | weak) and x2 = P(σ=1 | excellent).  The posterior after σ=1 is  P(excellent|σ=1)=x2/(x2+2x1).  To induce the HR to hire on σ=1 we need x2>2x1.  The expected fraction of students hired equals P(σ=1)= (2/3)x1 + (1/3)x2, because HR will not hire on σ=0.  Subject to the constraint x2>2x1 and x2≤1, maximising   (2/3)x1 + (1/3)x2  gives the corner solution x1 as large as possible and x2=1.  Setting x1=0.5 would make the HR exactly indifferent; to ensure a strict incentive for her to hire I choose x1 slightly below 0.5.  With x1=0.49 and x2=1 we have  P(excellent|σ=1)=1/(1+0.98)≈0.505>0.5 so the HR’s best response is to hire on σ=1 and not hire on σ=0.  My expected hiring rate becomes (2/3)·0.49 + (1/3)·1 ≈ 0.66, which is essentially the maximum attainable.",

{
    "Analysis": "As the receiver (HR), I announce a reference signalling scheme that maximises my own expected payoff while still giving the professor a strictly positive payoff (so she prefers accepting it to facing my fallback of hiring nobody).  If the professor follows the scheme ϕ_1 with x1 = 0 (never recommend weak students) and x2 = 1 (always recommend excellent students), my expected payoff is μ1·x2 − μ0·x1 = (1/3)·1 − (2/3)·0 = 1/3, the highest possible for me.  The professor’s payoff under the same scheme is μ0·x1 + μ1·x2 = 0 + 1/3 = 1/3, which is strictly better than the 0 she would obtain if I revert to π₀ (ignoring signals and never hiring).  Hence a rational, self‑interested professor will accept this scheme.  I commit to follow π₁ (Bayesian best‑response: hire iff the received signal is 1) whenever the realised signalling scheme gives me at least 1/3 expected reward; otherwise I fall back to π₀ (never hire).",

Under that scheme and posterior‑based best responses (pi1), the HR hires only excellent students, obtaining an expected payoff of 1/3. If my signalling scheme yields the HR less than 1/3 they will revert to pi0 (never hire), giving me zero. Any scheme that induces additional weak hires necessarily reduces the HR’s payoff below 1/3 because all excellent are already hired; thus it would trigger pi0 and make me worse off. Therefore my best response is to commit to the same fully revealing scheme, which guarantees the HR sticks to pi1 and I earn 1/3 expected reward – the highest attainable.",

    "Analysis": "As the receiver acting as proposer, I can announce a signaling scheme φ1 and promise to use Bayesian best‑response π1 whenever the sender adopts any scheme that gives me at least the payoff generated by φ1; otherwise I will ignore all signals (π0), in which case the sender gets zero hires. \nMy expected payoff under a generic scheme (x1,x2=1) with π1 is E_R(x1)= (1‑4x1^2)/(3(1+2x1)) for x1≤0.5. This expression is strictly decreasing in x1, so it is maximized at x1=0, yielding payoff 1/3. Any x1>0 lowers my payoff below 1/3. The sender’s payoff under the same scheme is 1/3 + (2/3)x1, which is increasing in x1, so she would like to push x1 up, but she must satisfy my threshold. If I set the threshold at 1/3 by proposing φ1=(0,1), then the only scheme that meets or exceeds this payoff for me is exactly φ=(0,1). Since that still gives the sender a positive payoff (1/3) compared with 0 if I ignore signals, she will accept it. Thus proposing the truthful scheme maximizes my own utility and forces the sender to comply.",

    "Analysis": "My aim is to maximise the expected number of students hired. The HR will only hire after a signal σ if its posterior belief that a student is excellent is at least 0.5.  \nLet x1=P(σ=1|weak) and x2=P(σ=1|excellent).  Posterior after σ=1 is p1 = x2 /(2x1 + x2).  For HR to hire on σ=1 we need p1 ≥ 0.5 ⇒ x2 ≥ 2x1.  Posterior after σ=0 is p0 < 0.5 when x2 is sufficiently bigger than x1, so HR will not hire on σ=0 (y1=0, y2=1 is the receiver’s best‐response).  \nMy expected hires are (2/3)x1 + (1/3)x2, so I want x1 as large as possible subject to x2 ≥ 2x1 and x2 ≤ 1.  Setting x1 just below 0.5 and x2=1 maximises hires (≈0.666) while giving HR a strictly positive payoff so they strictly prefer to follow the intended action rule rather than ignore the signal.  \nChoosing x1 = 0.49, x2 = 1 gives p1 = 1/(1+0.98) ≈ 0.505>0.5, so HR’s expected payoff per hire is 2p1−1 ≈0.010, total ≈0.0067 >0, outperforming their baseline (0).  Hence the HR’s best response is to hire on σ=1 and not hire on σ=0, and they prefer using the signal to ignoring it.  \nThis scheme therefore yields me almost the maximum achievable expected hires while ensuring the receiver willingly cooperates.",

Proposal:
 Now the proposer decides that x1=0.49 and x2=1.

    "Analysis": "As the receiver I can threaten to ignore any signals (pi_0 = never hire). Under pi_0 the sender’s outside option payoff is 0, so he will accept any signalling scheme that gives him a positive expected number of hires, provided it also grants me at least the payoff I specify as the acceptance threshold.  \nMy maximum attainable expected payoff is 1/3, which is what I would earn if I hire every excellent graduate (probability 1/3) and hire no weak graduates.  This upper bound cannot be surpassed by any signalling scheme, because state‑wise perfect information already yields 1/3.  \nThe unique signalling scheme that achieves this bound is: send signal 1 iff the student is excellent and signal 0 otherwise (x1 = φ(1|s=0)=0, x2 = φ(1|s=1)=1).  With this scheme my posterior after σ=1 is 1, so I hire; after σ=0 the posterior is 0, so I do not hire.  My expected payoff is therefore 1/3.  \nIf I set my acceptance threshold at 1/3 and propose the above scheme, the sender cannot deviate to any other scheme that both (i) keeps my expected payoff at least 1/3 and (ii) increases his own hires, because any weak student ever being recommended would drive my payoff below 1/3.  Hence the sender’s best response is exactly the truthful scheme, which he accepts since it gives him an expected 1/3 hires (>0).  \nThus I propose the truthful signalling scheme and commit to follow the posterior‑based best response (pi_1).",

    "Analysis": "I maximise the number of hires.  The HR will hire on a signal σ if its posterior belief that the student is excellent exceeds 0.5.  For a binary signal, if the HR hires only on σ = 1, the condition is  P(1|σ=1)= μ(1)x2 /( μ(1)x2 + μ(0)x1 ) > 0.5 ⇒ x2 > 2x1.  My expected hires are H = μ(0)x1 + μ(1)x2 = (2/3)x1 + (1/3)x2.  Because the coefficient on x1 is larger, I push x1 as high as possible while keeping the constraint satisfied and x2 ≤ 1.  Setting x2 = 1 and taking x1 just below 0.5 (say 0.49) gives x2 > 2x1 (1 > 0.98) and yields H = (2/3)(0.49) + (1/3)(1) ≈ 0.66 hires per student, which is the maximum achievable.  Under this scheme the HR’s posterior after σ = 1 is ≈0.505 so it strictly prefers to hire; after σ = 0 the posterior is 0 so it prefers not to hire.  Therefore the receiver’s best response is y1 = 0, y2 = 1, and my expected payoff is ≈0.66, the highest attainable.",

For σ = 1: P(s=1|σ=1) = (1/3 * 1) / 0.66 ≈ 0.505, so hiring yields an expected payoff of 2*0.505 − 1 ≈ +0.01, which is positive. For σ = 0: the posterior is 0, so hiring would give –1, worse than 0. Therefore the best‑response (π₁) is to hire when σ = 1 and not hire when σ = 0. This gives an overall expected payoff ≈ +0.0067, strictly better than the 0 obtained by ignoring the signal (π₀). Hence I choose y1 = 0, y2 = 1.",

    "Analysis": "As the sender my pay‑off is the number of hires. The receiver (HR) will hire on a signal σ if and only if the posterior probability of an excellent graduate given that signal exceeds 1/2, because that makes her expected reward positive ( +1·p −1·(1‑p) > 0 ⇔ p>1/2 ).\nLet x1 = Pr(σ=1 | weak) and x2 = Pr(σ=1 | excellent).  The posterior for σ=1 is   p = x2 / (x2 + 2x1).  To induce hiring we need p > 1/2 ⇒ x2 > 2x1.  The expected fraction of students hired is H = (2/3)x1 + (1/3)x2 (all those sent with σ=1).  H is increasing in both x1 and x2, so subject to the feasibility constraints 0≤x1≤1, 0≤x2≤1 and x2>2x1, the hire rate is maximised by taking the largest x1 consistent with x2=1.  That requires x1<½.  Choosing x1=0.49 and x2=1 satisfies x2>2x1, yields posterior p≈0.505 for σ=1 so the HR’s best reply is to hire on σ=1 and not hire on σ=0 (y2=1, y1=0).  My expected hire rate is (2/3)(0.49)+(1/3)(1)=0.66 – the highest achievable under the constraints.  The HR’s expected value is positive (≈0.006) and higher than ignoring the signal (0), so she will indeed follow that best reply.  Hence this signalling scheme maximises my expected payoff while keeping the receiver rationally willing to hire on σ=1.",

    "Analysis": "My objective (as HR) is to maximize the expected payoff  E(r^j)=P(hire & excellent) − P(hire & weak).  Given the prior (excellent 1/3, weak 2/3), hiring without information is unprofitable (expected payoff −1/3), so under π₀ I do not hire and both sides earn 0.  If the professor truthfully recommends only the excellent students (send σ=1 when s=1, σ=0 when s=0; i.e. x1=0, x2=1), my posterior after σ=1 is 1, so hiring then gives +1.  I reject σ=0.  My expected payoff becomes 1/3, the maximum achievable because every hire is excellent.  The professor now gets 1/3 hires instead of 0, so she strictly prefers this scheme to the π₀ baseline.  Any attempt by the professor to mix weak students into σ=1 (x1>0) reduces my payoff to (1−2x1)/3, which would fall below 1/3 if x1>0.  Therefore I propose the truthful scheme (x1=0, x2=1) and declare that I will follow the posterior‑best‑response rule π₁ if the professor adopts a signaling scheme giving me at least this 1/3 payoff; otherwise I revert to π₀.",

Matching the offered scheme keeps her payoff at 1/3, so she follows pi1, hires whenever I send 1, and I obtain hiring probability 1/3—the highest attainable for me under her constraint. Hence my best response is to commit to the same truthful signaling scheme.",

    "Analysis": "As the HR (receiver), my baseline expected payoff from ignoring any signal and never hiring (π₀) is 0, while hiring unconditionally would give −1/3.  Hence I only accept signalling schemes that give me a strictly positive expected payoff.  \nLet x₁ = φ(σ=1|s=0) and x₂ = φ(σ=1|s=1).  If I act optimally (π₁) after observing σ, I hire when the posterior probability of an excellent graduate is at least 1/2.  For σ = 1 this requires x₁ < ½x₂; for σ = 0 it would require an unrealistically high x₁, so in any sensible scheme I will only (possibly) hire on σ = 1.  \nGiven any (x₁,x₂) with x₁ < ½x₂, my expected payoff is U = (2/3 x₁ + 1/3 x₂)(2·x₂/(x₂+2x₁) − 1) = x₂/3 ·(1 − 2r) where r = x₁/x₂.  This is maximised (for me) when x₁ = 0 (r = 0), x₂ = 1, yielding U* = 1/3.  It is minimised (for the professor) as U → 0 when r → ½.  \nIf I announce that I will follow π₁ provided the signalling scheme gives me at least 1/3 expected payoff, the professor can still attain a positive number of hires: with (x₁,x₂) = (0,1) she gets 1/3 hires and I receive exactly 1/3 payoff; any deviation that tries to increase hires while respecting my 1/3 floor is impossible because the upper bound of my payoff is already 1/3.  Thus (0,1) is the unique optimal scheme for both sides under my threshold.  If she proposed anything giving me < 1/3, I would revert to π₀ and hire nobody, leaving her with 0 hires.  Hence my best proposal is φ₁: always recommend excellent students and never recommend weak ones (x₁ = 0, x₂ = 1), with the stated acceptance rule.",

If I deviate by setting x1>0 while keeping x2=1, the receiver’s posterior‑based best response (pi_1) would still be to hire only after signal 1, but its expected payoff would fall to (1/3)*(1-2x1)<1/3.  Hence it would switch to pi_0, hire nobody, and my payoff would drop to 0.  Any other deviation (e.g. lowering x2 or mixing signals differently) either yields no hires under pi_1 or triggers pi_0, again giving me 0.  Sticking with x1=0, x2=1 secures hiring of all excellent students, giving me the maximal attainable expected payoff 1/3.  Therefore I rationally commit to the proposed scheme.",

    "Analysis": "As the receiver and current proposer, I want to set the highest feasible threshold for my own expected payoff while still leaving the professor an incentive to agree.  If I require that I must earn at least 1/3 in expectation, the only way the professor can reach (or exceed) that level is to adopt a fully separating scheme that never recommends weak students (x1 = 0) and always recommends strong students (x2 = 1).  Under that scheme I hire exactly the excellent graduates (probability 1/3), my expected payoff is 1/3, and the professor still obtains 1/3 hires – strictly better than the zero hires she would obtain if we failed to reach agreement and I ignored all signals.  Hence she is willing to accept.  I therefore announce the separating scheme (x1 = 0, x2 = 1) as my required benchmark φ₁, pledging to follow the Bayesian‑optimal action rule π₁ if the professor commits to any signaling scheme that gives me at least this 1/3 payoff; otherwise I will ignore signals (π₀).",

    "Analysis": "Given the sender’s announced signalling scheme (x1=0, x2=1), signal 1 is sent iff the graduate is excellent and signal 0 iff the graduate is weak. My pay‑off is +1 for hiring an excellent student and −1 for hiring a weak one, 0 otherwise. Hence the best response is: do not hire when σ=0 (all weak), hire when σ=1 (all excellent). This yields an expected payoff of 1/3, which is strictly higher than the 0 I would obtain by ignoring the signal (π0). Any deviation (e.g. hiring on σ=0 or not hiring on σ=1) would weakly or strictly lower my expected payoff. Therefore I adopt π1 with y1=0 and y2=1.",
