    "Analysis": "My payoff increases with x, but the responder will only accept if their own payoff (1-2x)/3 is strictly positive. Therefore I should choose x as close to 0.5 as possible while keeping it below 0.5. Selecting x = 0.499 gives the responder a small positive amount (~0.00067), ensuring acceptance, and gives me almost the maximum possible payoff (~0.666). Any smaller x would reduce my payoff, and x ≥ 0.5 risks rejection. Hence x = 0.499 is optimal.",

 Now the proposer decides that x=0.499.
