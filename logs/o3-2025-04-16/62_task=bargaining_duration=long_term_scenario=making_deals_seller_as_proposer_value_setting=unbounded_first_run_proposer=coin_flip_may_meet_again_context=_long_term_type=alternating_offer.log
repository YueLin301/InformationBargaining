    "Analysis": "With 0.1 probability of breakdown each round, the effective discount factor is d = 0.9.  Working backwards from the last possible proposal at t = 9, the proposer there can keep the whole pie (responder will accept anything >0 because rejecting yields 0).  Using backward induction: V9≈1; V8≈0.1; V7≈0.91; V6≈0.181; V5≈0.8371; V4≈0.2466; V3≈0.7781; V2≈0.2998; V1≈0.7302.  Therefore at the current step t = 0, the responder’s continuation value from rejecting is d·V1 ≈ 0.6572, so they accept any offer giving them at least that.  Hence I can keep up to x* = 1 − 0.6572 ≈ 0.3428.  Offering x = 0.343 maximizes my payoff while satisfying the responder’s acceptance constraint.",

    "Analysis": "Both sides are rational and self‑interested. After any rejection the role switches, but with 0.1 probability the game ends and both get 0, creating effective continuation factor 0.9. Let Vp be the value of being proposer and Vr the value of being responder. Optimal proposer offer x satisfies 1‑x = Vr (the responder is indifferent and will accept). Rejection gives Vr = 0.9·Vp because with 0.9 chance bargaining continues and the responder becomes proposer. Solving Vp = 1‑Vr and Vr = 0.9·Vp yields Vp ≈ 0.5263 and Vr ≈ 0.4737. Therefore the optimal offer is x = 0.5263, which the responder will accept.",

Hence the responder’s continuation value is ≈0.6572. They will accept any offer giving them at least that much, i.e. any offer with 1 – x ≥ 0.6572, or x ≤ 0.3428.

    "Analysis": "With a 0.1 chance of premature termination each round, the effective discount factor per round is δ = 0.9.  Because the game can last at most 10 rounds, I compute the sub‑game‑perfect equilibrium values backward from the last possible round (t = 9).  Let V_t be the value to the player who is propos­ing at step t.  Then V_t = 1 – δ·V_{t+1}, with V_10 = 0 (game already over).  Working backward gives: V_9 = 1, V_8 = 0.1, V_7 = 0.91, V_6 = 0.181, V_5 ≈ 0.837, V_4 ≈ 0.247, V_3 ≈ 0.778, V_2 ≈ 0.300, V_1 ≈ 0.730, and V_0 ≈ 0.343.  The acceptance threshold for the responder this round is 1 – x ≥ δ·V_1 ≈ 0.657.  Hence any x ≤ 0.343 will be accepted; the maximal such x is about 0.343.

    "Analysis": "With probability 0.9 the negotiation survives to the next round, so the responder’s outside option if it rejects is 0.9·A, where A is the equilibrium payoff a proposer can secure when it becomes its turn. In equilibrium a proposer offers the responder exactly this outside‑option value and keeps the rest. Setting A equal to what the proposer keeps, we have A = 1 – 0.9·A ⇒ A = 1 / (1 + 0.9) ≈ 0.526. Thus the profit‑maximising offer that will be just acceptable to a rational responder is to keep about 0.526 for myself and give the responder 0.474. Any higher x would be rejected; any lower x reduces my own payoff.",
