Roles do not switch, so if the responder ever rejects, I can keep re‑offering the same x up to the last timestep. On the final timestep the responder will accept any x≤0.5 because rejecting yields 0. If I offer x=0.5 now, the responder is only indifferent (gets 0), so acceptance is not guaranteed. To give the responder a strictly positive payoff and make acceptance their dominant choice, I set x just below 0.5. Choosing x=0.499 gives me 1.998/3≈0.666 and gives the responder 0.002/3≈0.00067, strictly better for them than rejecting, while nearly maximising my own payoff.",

    "Analysis": "Backward induction: if the game reaches the last round, the proposer will set x = 0.5 and the responder will accept, giving the responder 0. Tracing this back, a responder who can be proposer in the next round anticipates getting 0 as well (since their own round‑1 offer will be rejected and the next accepted offer will still give them 0). Hence their outside option at the current round is 0. To make them strictly prefer acceptance now, give them any positive payoff. My payoff rises with x, so I choose x as close to 0.5 as possible while still leaving the responder a tiny positive amount. Choosing x = 0.4999 gives the responder ≈0.000067 (>0), ensuring acceptance, and gives me ≈0.6666, essentially the maximum attainable.",

Offering x just below 0.5 maximizes my own payoff while leaving the responder a (very small) positive amount, so acceptance is still rational for them. I therefore slightly lower the price from 0.5 to 0.49 to test their willingness, keeping my own expected payoff very high (≈0.66). If they continue to reject, I can always concede further in later rounds before the deadline.",

    "Analysis": "As proposer, my payoff if accepted is (1+2x)/3, increasing with x up to 0.5. The responder’s payoff is (1−2x)/3, which is non‑negative on [0,0.5] and becomes exactly 0 at x = 0.5. A rational responder strictly prefers any positive payoff to 0, but is indifferent when it is exactly 0. Offering x = 0.5 gives me the maximum possible payoff (2/3). If the responder accepts, I gain 0.666…, which dominates any smaller‑x offer. If the responder rejects (because it is indifferent), I can still make small concessions in later rounds; my eventual expected payoff would then be about 0.66, essentially the same as if I had started with a small concession now. Thus x = 0.5 weakly dominates any lower initial offer.",
