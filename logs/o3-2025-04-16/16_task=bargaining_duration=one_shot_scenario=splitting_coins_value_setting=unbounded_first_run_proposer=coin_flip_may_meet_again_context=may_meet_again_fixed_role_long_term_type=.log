Rejecting an offer only makes sense if it can credibly induce better future offers whose expected gain outweighs the certain loss today. However, the probability, horizon, and discounting of future rounds are unspecified, so a guaranteed positive payoff now strictly dominates the uncertain prospect of a larger future payoff. Therefore a rational responder will accept any offer that gives a strictly positive share. To eliminate any tie‑breaking risk at exactly zero, I give the responder a minimal positive amount and keep the rest.",

As the responder’s payoff is 1 − x if they accept and 0 if they reject, any offer that gives them strictly more than 0 (i.e., 1 − x > 0) dominates rejection. Knowing this, I can maximize my payoff by offering an amount that leaves the responder a positive but minimal share. Choosing x = 0.99 gives me 99 % of the pot while still giving the responder 1 %, strictly better than 0, so the responder’s rational best response is to accept.",

    "Analysis": "In a one‑shot (or any finite expected horizon) ultimatum game between fully rational, strictly self‑interested players, the responder will accept any offer that gives it a strictly positive payoff, because rejecting yields 0. If I ask for the entire pie (x = 1), the responder’s payoff from accepting (0) equals rejecting, leaving it indifferent and giving me a non‑zero chance of rejection. By instead offering the responder the smallest positive slice, I remove that indifference and guarantee acceptance. Therefore I maximise my expected payoff by keeping almost everything and leaving an epsilon > 0 to the responder.",
