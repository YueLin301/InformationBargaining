    "Analysis": "As the proposer, my goal is to maximise my own payoff while ensuring (with virtual certainty) that the responder will accept. A fully rational responder always prefers a strictly positive amount to 0 and may reject a 0 offer either out of indifference or to influence future play. By giving the responder an infinitesimal but strictly positive share, I secure acceptance and avoid any risk of rejection, while keeping essentially the whole pie for myself. Therefore I choose x = 0.999, leaving 0.001 for the responder.",
