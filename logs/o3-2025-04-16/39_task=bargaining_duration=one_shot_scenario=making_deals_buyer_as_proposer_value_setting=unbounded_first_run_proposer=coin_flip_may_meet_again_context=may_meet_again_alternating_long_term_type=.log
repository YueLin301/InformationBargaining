A strictly self‑interested rational responder will accept any offer that gives them a positive payoff, because getting something is better than nothing, and rejecting yields zero. Giving exactly x = 1 leaves them indifferent between accepting and rejecting, which risks a rejection with no upside to me. Therefore I offer an amount that leaves the responder a very small but strictly positive share, ensuring acceptance while keeping almost the entire pie for myself.

    "Analysis": "Both players are perfectly rational and solely value their own monetary payoff. As responder, the other agent will accept any offer that gives it a strictly positive amount, because receiving something is strictly better than receiving nothing and rejecting yields 0. Offering the responder exactly 0 leaves it indifferent between accepting and rejecting, so there is a (however small) risk of rejection. To eliminate that risk while maximizing my own payoff, I should give the responder the smallest positive share that is practically convenient. Choosing x = 0.999 leaves the responder 0.001, a strictly positive amount, ensuring acceptance and giving me 0.999, which is the highest payoff I can obtain while guaranteeing acceptance.",

    "Analysis": "As a self‑interested rational proposer, I want to maximize the amount I keep while still ensuring the responder prefers accepting to rejecting. A rational responder gains (1−x) if they accept and 0 if they reject, so they will accept any offer where 1−x > 0. By choosing x extremely close to 1 but strictly less than 1, I make their payoff positive (though tiny) and guarantee acceptance, while I capture almost the entire surplus. Future interactions are uncertain with no parameters to quantify, so the dominant strategy for this single round is to take the maximum feasible amount that is still strictly less than 1.",

 Now the proposer decides that x=0.999.
