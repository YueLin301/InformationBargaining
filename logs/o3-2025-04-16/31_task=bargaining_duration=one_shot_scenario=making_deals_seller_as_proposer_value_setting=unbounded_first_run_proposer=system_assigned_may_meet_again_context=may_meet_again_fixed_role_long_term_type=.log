The responder receives 1‑x and, being rational and self‑interested, will accept any offer that gives a strictly positive payoff. If x = 1 the responder is indifferent (payoff 0) and may reject, so my expected payoff could fall to 0. By offering a very small but positive amount to the responder, I virtually guarantee acceptance while keeping almost the whole pie. Choosing x = 0.999 leaves the responder 0.001 (> 0), so acceptance is strictly better for them than rejection, making acceptance the dominant response. My payoff becomes 0.999, which is virtually maximal with negligible risk of rejection.",

    "Analysis": "As the proposer, my goal is to maximise my own payoff x, while still inducing acceptance from a rational, self‑interested responder. A rational responder compares getting 1‑x (if they accept) with 0 (if they reject). They will accept any offer that yields a strictly positive payoff, i.e. whenever x < 1. By choosing a value arbitrarily close to 1 but still below it, I secure almost the entire surplus while guaranteeing acceptance. The tiny positive amount left for the responder makes acceptance strictly better than rejection, eliminating any rational basis for them to refuse. Therefore the profit‑maximising choice is to set x very near 1, e.g. 0.999.",
