    "Analysis": "As the rational proposer, I want to maximize my own payoff but also ensure immediate acceptance. If I keep the entire pie (x = 1), the responderâ€™s payoff is 0, leaving them indifferent between accepting and rejecting. Indifference may lead to a rejection in hope of a better future offer, introducing a (however small) risk that I end up with nothing after the 5â€‘step horizon. By instead offering the responder the smallest positive amount (e.g., 0.001), they obtain a strictly higher payoff by accepting now than by rejecting, guaranteeing acceptance. The cost to me is only 0.001, while it eliminates any downside risk. Thus x = 0.999 strictly dominates x = 1 in expected terms.",

Offering x = 0.99 gives the responder 0.01, strictly better than the 0 they would get by rejecting and hoping for a better deal later, so acceptance is their unique rational choice. This secures a nearâ€‘maximal payoff for me with very high probability in the first round, avoiding any risk from further negotiation.",
