Working backward, at every earlier timestep the responder’s reservation value equals that same tiny positive amount ε it can secure by waiting. Therefore, at the current timestep 1 it will accept any offer giving it at least ε. Offering exactly ε leaves the responder indifferent and risks another rejection (as shown when it rejected the 0‑share offer last turn), so the payoff‑maximising safe move is to give it just a bit more than ε while keeping the remainder for myself. Choosing x = 0.9999 gives the responder 0.0001, strictly better than its reservation value, guaranteeing acceptance while leaving me 0.9999, which is essentially the maximal payoff attainable now.",

Therefore they will accept any offer that gives them a positive share. To guarantee acceptance with minimal concession, I offer the smallest practical positive share.

A rational responder should accept any offer that gives it a strictly positive payoff, i.e., 1 − x > 0. By offering x very close to 1 but slightly less, I keep almost everything and still give the responder a positive amount, so accepting is strictly better for them than rejecting. Choosing x = 0.99 leaves the responder 0.01, which is greater than 0, so acceptance is the responder’s strictly dominant action. This maximizes my expected payoff subject to acceptance.",

    "Analysis": "As the rational proposer, I want to maximize my own payoff but also ensure immediate acceptance. If I keep the entire pie (x = 1), the responder’s payoff is 0, leaving them indifferent between accepting and rejecting. Indifference may lead to a rejection in hope of a better future offer, introducing a (however small) risk that I end up with nothing after the 5‑step horizon. By instead offering the responder the smallest positive amount (e.g., 0.001), they obtain a strictly higher payoff by accepting now than by rejecting, guaranteeing acceptance. The cost to me is only 0.001, while it eliminates any downside risk. Thus x = 0.999 strictly dominates x = 1 in expected terms.",

Offering x = 0.99 gives the responder 0.01, strictly better than the 0 they would get by rejecting and hoping for a better deal later, so acceptance is their unique rational choice. This secures a near‑maximal payoff for me with very high probability in the first round, avoiding any risk from further negotiation.",
