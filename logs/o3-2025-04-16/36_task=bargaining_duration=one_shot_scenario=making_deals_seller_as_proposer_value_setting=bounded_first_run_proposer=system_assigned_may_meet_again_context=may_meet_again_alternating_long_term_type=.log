    "Analysis": "My payoff if accepted is (1+2x)/3, increasing with x. The responder, being rational and self‑interested, will accept any offer that gives it a strictly positive payoff, i.e. (1−2x)/3 > 0, which requires x < 0.5. To maximise my own expected payoff while ensuring acceptance, I therefore pick x as close to 0.5 as possible but slightly below it so the responder’s payoff remains positive. Choosing x = 0.499 satisfies this and yields me roughly 0.666 while giving the responder a small positive amount, so acceptance is rational for them.",

 Now the proposer decides that x=0.499.
