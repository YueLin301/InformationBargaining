    "Analysis": "At t=0 the responder compares the immediate payoff (1-2x)/3 with the continuation value obtained after rejecting.  If they reject, with probability 0.9 the roles switch and they become the proposer at t=1, where the equilibrium offer is x=0.5 and they obtain 2/3.  Hence their continuation value is 0.9·(2/3)=0.6, which exceeds the maximum possible immediate payoff of 1/3 (attained when x=0).  Therefore, no feasible x∈[0,0.5] can satisfy the responder’s acceptance condition, so any offer we make will be rejected.  Given this, our own expected payoff this round is zero no matter what x we choose, and the exact value of x is irrelevant.  I therefore choose x=0.5 (the value that would maximize my payoff were acceptance possible).",

    "Analysis": "My goal is to maximise my own expected payoff subject to the responder’s acceptance.  If the responder rejects, the game may end with 10 % probability and, if it continues, the responder becomes the proposer next round.  Hence the responder’s continuation value is about 0.9 times the expected payoff a proposer gets.  In the stationary equilibrium with this 0.9 survival probability, the proposer’s expected payoff is about 0.350 and the responder’s is about 0.315.  Therefore the responder will accept any offer giving them at least ≈0.315.  With x the share parameter, the responder’s payoff is (1−2x)/3.  Setting (1−2x)/3 = 0.315 yields x ≈ 0.026.  To ensure acceptance while giving myself the highest possible payoff, I offer a slightly lower x = 0.025.",

    "Analysis": "To maximize my own expected payoff while ensuring acceptance, I must give the responder at least their continuation value.  If the responder rejects, with probability 0.9 the negotiation continues and they become the proposer, whose equilibrium expected payoff is V_P.  Setting up equations:\n  (1−2x)/3 = 0.9·V_P and V_P = (2/3) − (1−2x)/3.  Solving yields V_P ≈ 0.3509 and the minimum acceptable responder share ≈ 0.3158, which corresponds to x ≈ 0.0263.  Any higher x would make the responder’s share smaller than their continuation value, so they would rationally reject, giving me a lower expected payoff.  Therefore I propose x ≈ 0.0263, guaranteeing acceptance and giving me a payoff of ≈0.3509, which is higher than any alternative offer that risks rejection.",

If they reject now, there is a 0.1 chance the game ends immediately (both get 0) and a 0.9 chance they become the proposer next turn.  In the sub‑game perfect equilibrium of this alternating‑offer game with a continuation probability δ = 0.9, a player who is about to become proposer can secure a fraction u = 1/(1+δ) ≈ 0.5263 of the total pie (2/3).  Thus the responder’s continuation value is δ·u ≈ 0.9·0.5263 ≈ 0.4737 of the pie, i.e. (2/3)·0.4737 ≈ 0.3158 in absolute payoff.  They will accept any offer giving them at least that much.  Setting d = 2x so that the responder’s share is (1−d)/2 = 0.4737 ⇒ d ≈ 0.0526 ⇒ x ≈ 0.0263 makes them exactly indifferent; any larger x would lead to rejection.  Therefore x ≈ 0.0263 maximizes my expected payoff while being accepted with certainty (up to rounding).",

    "Analysis": "The responder will compare the sure payoff (1-2x)/3 from accepting to the expected payoff from rejecting: with 0.1 probability the game ends (payoff 0), and with 0.9 probability they become the proposer next round and earn (1+2x)/3. Hence accept if (1-2x)/3 ≥ 0.9*(1+2x)/3, which simplifies to x ≤ 0.1/3.8 ≈ 0.0263. My own payoff rises with x, so the best offer that will still be accepted is x* ≈ 0.0263. Any higher x is rejected and leaves me only 0.9·R ≈ 0.28 in expectation, worse than accepting payoff 0.35. Therefore I propose x = 0.0263.",

    "Analysis": "Both players are perfectly rational and self‑interested.  If an offer is rejected, the game continues with roles switched, but there is a 0.1 probability of ending each round, so the responder’s continuation value is discounted by δ = 0.9.  Let V_P be the payoff a player gets when it is their turn to propose and V_R when they are responder.  In equilibrium the proposer makes the responder just indifferent between accepting and rejecting: (1‑2x)/3 = δ·(1+2x)/3.  Solving gives x* ≈ 0.0263.  To avoid any tie‑breaking ambiguity, I offer slightly less—x = 0.026—so that the responder’s payoff is very slightly above its continuation value and it strictly prefers to accept.  This maximises my expected payoff while ensuring acceptance.",

    "Analysis": "Total payoff if an offer is accepted is fixed at 2/3; if it is rejected both get 0 this round and, with probability 0.1, the game ends. Hence the implicit discount factor per round is δ = 0.9. In the sub‑game–perfect equilibrium of an alternating‑offer game with discount δ, the player whose turn it is to propose receives a share V = (pie)/(1+δ) and offers the responder exactly δ·V, which makes the responder indifferent between accepting and rejecting. Here, pie = 2/3, so V = (2/3)/(1+0.9) ≈ 0.3509 and the responder’s indifference payoff is 0.9·V ≈ 0.3158. To translate this into the parameter x, we need (1+2x)/3 = 0.3509, giving x* ≈ 0.0263. Offering any x > 0.02632 would make the responder’s share fall below 0.3158 and be rejected; any x ≤ 0.02632 slightly lowers my own payoff. Choosing x = 0.0263 lets me keep ≈0.3507 while giving the responder ≈0.316, which strictly beats their continuation value, so they should accept.",

    "Analysis": "At t = 0 I am the proposer.  If my offer is accepted I get (1+2x)/3 and the other player gets (1–2x)/3 (≤ 1/3).  If it is rejected, with probability 0.9 the game continues to t = 1, roles switch, and the other player will then be the proposer.  By backward induction (working from the final t = 9 round and taking the 0.1 probability of termination after each round into account) the responder’s continuation value at even timesteps (including t = 0) is 0.9 × (2/3) = 0.6.  Since the largest payoff I can ever give the responder with any admissible x is 1/3 < 0.6, the responder will rationally reject any offer I make now.  Hence no offer can be accepted and my expected payoff this round is 0 whatever x I state.  Therefore I may as well choose the payoff‑maximising x = 0.5 (which keeps the whole feasible surplus for me were it ever accepted, while costing me nothing when it is inevitably rejected).",

In the sub‑game perfect equilibrium of this alternating‑offer game with breakdown probability 0.1 (δ = 0.9), the proposer can ensure acceptance by offering the responder a utility equal to δ·V, where V is the proposer’s equilibrium payoff next round.  Solving the fixed‑point conditions yields V = 2 / [3 (1+δ)] and the corresponding offer x* = (1‑δ) / [2 (1+δ)] ≈ 0.0263.  Any x ≤ x* will be accepted; larger x will be rejected.

{
    "Analysis": "If I accept, I obtain (1−2·0.025)/3 = 0.95/3 ≈ 0.31667. If I reject, there is a 0.9 chance the game continues and I become proposer, whose optimal equilibrium payoff is ≈0.35088, and a 0.1 chance the game stops with 0. Thus the expected payoff from rejecting is 0.9·0.35088 ≈ 0.31579. Since 0.31667 > 0.31579, accepting yields the higher expected payoff.",
