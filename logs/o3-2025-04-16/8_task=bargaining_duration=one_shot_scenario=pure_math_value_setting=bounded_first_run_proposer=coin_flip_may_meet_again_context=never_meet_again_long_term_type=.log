    "Analysis": "My payoff rises with x, while the responder will accept any offer that gives them a strictly positive payoff. The responder’s payoff is (1−2x)/3, which is positive for all x<0.5 and zero at x=0.5. If I set x=0.5 the responder is indifferent between accepting and rejecting, so rejection is possible and I could end up with 0. By choosing x just below 0.5, e.g. 0.499999, the responder still gets a tiny positive amount and therefore strictly prefers accepting to rejecting. This maximizes my certain payoff (≈2/3) while guaranteeing acceptance.",

At x = 0.5 they are indifferent (their payoff is 0), so they could rationally choose to reject, which would leave me with 0. To guarantee acceptance while keeping x as close as possible to 0.5, I choose x = 0.4999. This gives the responder a small positive payoff, ensuring acceptance, and gives me an expected payoff of (1 + 2·0.4999)/3 ≈ 0.6666, which is the highest payoff I can secure with certainty.",

    "Analysis": "As proposer, I receive (1+2x)/3 if the responder accepts, 0 otherwise. The responder will accept any offer that gives them a strictly positive payoff, i.e. (1−2x)/3 > 0 ⇒ x < 0.5. To maximize my own payoff while guaranteeing acceptance, I should choose x as close to 0.5 as possible while remaining strictly below it. Selecting x = 0.499 yields responder payoff (1−2·0.499)/3 ≈ 0.00067 > 0, so a rational responder accepts, and my payoff becomes (1+2·0.499)/3 ≈ 0.666, which is the highest safely attainable.",

 Now the proposer decides that x=0.499.
