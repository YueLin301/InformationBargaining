To secure near‑certain acceptance while losing an arbitrarily small amount, I offer x just below 0.5. Choosing x = 0.4999 gives me (1+2·0.4999)/3 ≈ 0.6666 and gives the responder (1‑2·0.4999)/3 ≈ 0.0000667, so acceptance is strictly preferred for the responder, ensuring my expected payoff is essentially maximal.",

    "Analysis": "The responder is a self‑interested rational agent. Accepting gives it (1−2x)/3 ≥ 0 for every admissible x (0 ≤ x ≤ 0.5). Rejecting yields 0. Because a rational agent never turns down a weakly better offer, it will accept any x ≤ 0.5 (and is indifferent at x = 0.5). To maximize my own payoff (1+2x)/3, I therefore choose the largest allowed x. This gives me 2⁄3 and the responder 0, which is still no worse than rejection, so acceptance is rational.",

 Now the proposer decides that x=0.5.

    "Analysis": "The responder will accept if its payoff (1-2x)/3 is non‑negative. For all x ≤ 0.5 this holds, and at x = 0.5 the responder’s payoff is exactly 0, making it indifferent between accepting and rejecting. Under standard game‑theoretic tie‑breaking, an indifferent rational agent accepts since rejection yields the same payoff. My own payoff (1+2x)/3 is strictly increasing in x, so the maximal feasible x, 0.5, maximizes my expected payoff. Hence proposing x = 0.5 is optimal.",
