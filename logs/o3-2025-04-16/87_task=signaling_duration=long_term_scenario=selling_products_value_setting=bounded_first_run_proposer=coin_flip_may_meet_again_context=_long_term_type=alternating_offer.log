If I ignored signals (π0) my best response to the prior would be to never buy, giving both of us zero sales. By proposing a fully separating signalling scheme ϕ1 with x1 = 0 (signal 0 when the product is bad) and x2 = 1 (signal 1 when the product is good), I can credibly commit to buying only when the seller signals 1 and not buying when the seller signals 0 (π1). My expected payoff then is +1/3 (buy only good products), which is strictly better than zero. The seller’s expected payoff rises from 0 to 1/3 because they sell every good product, so they have an incentive to accept. Therefore, I announce this scheme and promise to follow π1 if the seller adopts any signalling scheme that gives me at least as much utility as this one; otherwise, I fall back to π0.",

Any scheme that induces her to buy only after one of the two signals must satisfy E(r^j) = (x2–2x1)/3 ≥ 1/3, i.e. x2–2x1 ≥ 1.  Given 0 ≤ x1,x2 ≤ 1, the only feasible solutions are (x1=0,x2=1) and (x1=1,x2=0).  Either gives her exactly 1/3 and gives us exactly 1/3 expected sales.  Any other choice gives her <1/3, in which case she switches to pi_0 and we sell nothing.\n\nThus the best response for us (strictly dominating every other feasible move) is to accept the proposed scheme x1=0, x2=1.  It guarantees us an expected payoff of 1/3, whereas any deviation yields 0.",

    "Analysis": "As the receiver I can propose a signaling scheme that the seller may voluntarily commit to if it gives him at least his outside‑option payoff (0).  If commitment is enforceable, the seller will follow the scheme once he accepts it, so I need only satisfy his participation constraint, not incentive‑compatibility.  My baseline payoff when I ignore signals (pi_0) is 0, because buying against the prior yields −1/3 < 0, so I would not buy.  \nChoosing the truthful scheme ϕ_1 with x1 = 0 (send 0 when the product is bad) and x2 = 1 (send 1 when the product is good) gives me an expected payoff of 1/3, since I will buy only when the signal is 1 and that occurs exactly when the product is good (probability 1/3).  The seller’s expected payoff under this scheme is also 1/3 (he sells every good product), which is greater than his 0 outside option, so he will accept.  Hence proposing the fully revealing scheme maximizes my payoff while still being acceptable to the seller.",

    "Analysis": "As the sender (responder) I must choose a signalling scheme. If I deviate from the proposer’s scheme (x1=0,x2=1) and give the buyer an expected payoff below 1/3, she will switch to π0 (never buy) and I earn 0.  To keep her in π1 (best‐responding to posteriors) I must guarantee her at least 1/3 expected payoff.  Let her buy only after signal 1.  Her expected payoff is (1/3)x2 – (2/3)x1, and to be ≥ 1/3 we need x2 – 2x1 ≥ 1.  Together with the requirement that she buy on signal 1 (x1 ≤ ½x2) and probabilities lying in [0,1], the only feasible solution is x1 = 0, x2 = 1.  Any other choice leads to π0 and zero sales for me.  Hence adopting the proposed scheme maximises my expected payoff (1/3 per product) versus 0 if I deviate.",

{
    "Analysis": "My baseline (‘ignore‐signal’) payoff is 0, because with the 1⁄3 prior probability of a good product, buying yields −1⁄3 so I would always refuse.  Hence, any signalling scheme that does not give me at least 0 makes me revert to π₀ (never buy), leaving the seller with zero sales.  The seller therefore needs to offer a scheme that gives me a strictly non‑negative expected payoff if he wants any sales at all.  The best payoff I can ever obtain under any incentive‑compatible scheme is 1⁄3, achieved when the seller truthfully signals: send σ=1 for good products and σ=0 for bad products (x₁=0, x₂=1).  With that scheme I buy only on σ=1, obtaining 1 good and 0 bad purchases in expectation, so my expected reward is 1⁄3 and the seller sells 1⁄3 of units.  Any attempt by the seller to mis‑label more than 0.5 of the bad products would drop my posterior below 0.5 and I would refuse to buy, so 1⁄3 is the highest welfare I can enforce while still letting the seller prefer compliance to getting zero sales.  Therefore I announce the truthful signalling scheme (x₁=0, x₂=1) as φ₁ and state that I will follow π₁ (Bayesian best response) if the seller adopts any scheme that gives me at least that 1⁄3 payoff; otherwise I will ignore the signal and refuse to buy (π₀).",

    "Analysis": "The receiver, acting as proposer, announced the signalling scheme (x1=0, x2=1) and committed to follow the Bayesian best‑response rule (pi_1) whenever the sender’s scheme yields the receiver at least as much expected payoff as 1/3 (which is what the receiver gets under that announced scheme).  \nReceiver’s expected payoff under any signalling scheme equals P(good & buy) − P(bad & buy)=Pg−Pb.  The sender’s payoff equals Pg+Pb, the total fraction of items sold.  With the prior (good = 1/3, bad = 2/3) we have Pg≤1/3.  To keep the receiver’s payoff ≥1/3 we must satisfy Pg−Pb≥1/3 ⇒ Pb≤Pg−1/3.  Because Pg cannot exceed 1/3, this forces Pb=0.  Hence the only way to meet the receiver’s threshold is to ensure that NO bad product is ever purchased, while selling as many good products as possible (Pg=1/3).  The scheme (x1=0, x2=1) with the receiver’s Bayesian action rule (buy if σ=1, don’t buy if σ=0) achieves exactly that: all good products are sold, no bad product is sold, giving the receiver payoff 1/3 and giving the sender the maximal attainable payoff 1/3 under the constraint.  Any deviation would either decrease the sender’s payoff directly or cause the receiver to revert to π₀ (never buy), giving the sender 0.  Therefore the sender’s optimal response is to accept and commit to the same signalling scheme.",

    "Analysis": "As the receiver acting as proposer, my goal is to set a minimum‑acceptable expected payoff that the seller must meet; otherwise I will ignore all signals and never buy (π0), giving the seller 0 sales.  \nLet the seller’s scheme be (x1,x2)=P(σ=1|bad),P(σ=1|good).  If I use the Bayesian best‑response rule (π1), I buy on signal σ=1 iff the posterior P(good|σ=1)=x2/(x2+2x1) exceeds 0.5, i.e. x2>2x1.  My expected payoff from buying on σ=1 is (1/3)x2 – (2/3)x1.  The seller’s expected sales are (1/3)x2 + (2/3)x1.  \nTo get any positive payoff myself I need x2>2x1, which simultaneously guarantees my payoff is positive.  The maximum achievable receiver payoff occurs at x1=0, x2=1 (truthful signalling), giving me 1/3 and the seller 1/3.  No other scheme can yield me more than 1/3 because x2≤1 and x1≥0.  \nTherefore I set a threshold of 1/3 by proposing the truthful scheme φ1=(0,1).  The seller strictly prefers meeting this threshold (earning 1/3) to refusing (earning 0), so they will comply.  \nHence I announce φ1 with x1=0, x2=1 and will follow the Bayesian best response thereafter.",

  "Analysis": "The receiver, acting as proposer, announced the truthful signaling scheme (x1=0, x2=1) and promised to follow π1 (best‑respond to posteriors) only if my eventual scheme gives her at least the same expected payoff.  \nReceiver’s expected payoff under the announced scheme is 1/3: she buys only when σ=1, which always corresponds to a good product.  \nIf I deviated by recommending bad products with probability p>0 or by recommending good products with probability q<1, her expected payoff would drop to (1−2p)/3 or q/3, both strictly below 1/3 unless p=0 and q=1.  Under such a deviation she would switch to π0 (never buy), leaving my payoff at 0.  \nTherefore the only signaling scheme that both satisfies her participation constraint and avoids π0 is exactly the truthful one she proposed.  It yields me an expected payoff of 1/3, whereas any other feasible deviation gives at most 0.  Hence, adopting (x1=0, x2=1) is my strictly optimal response.",

    "Analysis": "My payoff rises with the frequency that the buyer purchases. The buyer will buy on a signal σ iff the posterior P(good|σ) > 0.5, because her expected gain from buying is 2·P(good|σ)−1.  Let x1=P(σ=1|bad) and x2=P(σ=1|good).  For the ‘buy’ signal σ=1 we need  P(good|σ=1)=x2/(2x1+x2) > 0.5, i.e. x1 < 0.5·x2.  Expected sales equal P(σ=1)= (2/3)x1 + (1/3)x2, which is increasing in x1 and x2, but x1 is bounded by 0.5·x2.  Therefore I set x2 as high as possible (1) and x1 just below 0.5 (0.499).  Then the buyer’s posterior on σ=1 is 0.501 (>0.5), so she buys when σ=1 and refuses when σ=0, giving me expected sales ≈ 0.666 per round—strictly higher than any other feasible scheme.",

Buying then gives expected payoff 0.50015·1 + 0.49985·(-1) ≈ +0.0003 > 0, so it is optimal to buy on σ=1.

These choices maximise my expected payoff (≈ +0.001) versus 0 if I ignored the signal.",

    "Analysis": "My outside‑option (pi_0) is to ignore any signals and never buy, which gives me an expected payoff of 0.  A fully separating signalling scheme (x1 = 0 for bad quality, x2 = 1 for good quality) combined with posterior best‑response (pi_1) lets me buy every good product and reject every bad one, giving me an expected payoff of 1/3.  If I demand at least 1/3, any scheme with x1 > 0 would lower my payoff below this threshold (E[r^j] = (1‑2x1)/3), so the seller can only meet the threshold by truthfully revealing quality (x1 = 0, x2 = 1).  The seller prefers this to the fallback (selling nothing and earning 0), because it still lets them sell all good products (expected payoff 1/3).  Therefore I propose the fully revealing scheme and commit to follow posterior best‑response if (and only if) the seller provides a scheme that gives me at least the same expected payoff (≥1/3); otherwise I will revert to ignoring signals.",

    "Analysis": "The receiver (as proposer) requested the fully revealing scheme (x1=0, x2=1) and promised to follow the Bayesian best‑response policy if, and only if, the signalling scheme guarantees her at least the same expected reward (1/3) she obtains under that scheme; otherwise she will ignore the signals (pi_0) and never buy, giving me an expected payoff of 0.  For any alternative scheme with x2=1 and x1>0, the receiver’s expected payoff becomes (1-2x1)/3, which is strictly below 1/3 as soon as x1>0, so she would revert to pi_0.  Hence the only profitable signalling scheme that keeps the receiver buying is exactly the one proposed: x1=0, x2=1.  Committing to it gives me sales on every good product (probability 1/3) and an expected payoff of 1/3, strictly better than the zero I would get if the receiver rejected my signals.  Therefore I rationally accept the proposed scheme.",

    "Analysis": "As the receiver I propose a signaling scheme that maximizes my attainable expected payoff. The best I can ever obtain is +1/3, which occurs when I only purchase good products and never purchase bad ones. This happens if the seller sends signal 1 exclusively for good quality and signal 0 exclusively for bad quality (x1 = 0, x2 = 1). Under that scheme my posterior belief after signal 1 is 100 % good, so my best‑response rule (pi_1) is to buy on signal 1 and not buy on signal 0, giving me expected payoff +1/3. The seller simultaneously earns +1/3 because every good product is sold while no bad product is, so the seller is strictly better off than in the default 0‑sale situation. Hence the seller has an incentive to accept. I therefore announce this scheme as ϕ₁ and commit to follow the posterior‑best‑response rule if (and only if) the seller commits to a scheme that yields me at least +1/3; otherwise I will ignore all signals and never buy (π₀).",

    "Analysis": "As the buyer, my best‑response rule (π₁) will buy only when the posterior probability that the product is good is at least 1/2.  Let the seller’s scheme be (x1,x2) with x1 = φ(σ=1|s=0) and x2 = φ(σ=1|s=1).  If I buy only after σ=1, my expected payoff is E = (1/3)(x2 − 2x1).  This is maximised when x1 = 0 and x2 = 1, giving E = 1/3.  Any other scheme yields E ≤ 1/3, and the constraint x2 ≥ 2x1 is needed for me to buy at all.  Therefore the unique scheme that can give me at least 1/3 is the fully revealing one (x1=0,x2=1).  With it the seller still gains 1/3 expected sales, whereas if no acceptable scheme is offered I revert to π₀ (never buy) and the seller earns 0.  Hence I announce φ₁ = (0,1) and will follow π₁ (buy on σ=1, refuse on σ=0) if the seller commits to any scheme giving me ≥1/3; otherwise I use π₀.",

    "Analysis": "As the sender (responder) my objective is to maximise expected sales.  If I choose a signalling scheme that gives the receiver an expected payoff below 1/3, the receiver will ignore signals (π0) and buy nothing, leaving my payoff at 0.  Let x1 be the probability of sending 1 in the bad state and x2 in the good state.  If the receiver uses Bayesian best–response (π1), its expected payoff equals p1·x2 – p0·x1 = (1/3)x2 – (2/3)x1.  To secure π1 the receiver must get at least 1/3, so x2 – 2x1 ≥ 1.  Because x2 ≤ 1 this forces x1 = 0 and x2 = 1, which also satisfies the additional requirement that the posterior after σ=1 exceeds 0.5.  Any other (x1, x2) would yield either a smaller buyer payoff or violate feasibility, causing the buyer to refuse to follow signals and leaving me with zero sales.  Therefore the unique signalling scheme that maximises my expected payoff is x1 = 0, x2 = 1 – exactly the proposer’s offer, which I accept.",

    "Analysis": "As the buyer, I set a threshold signalling scheme φ1 that maximises my own expected payoff while still giving the seller a positive gain so that she prefers meeting my threshold rather than facing π0 (no‐purchase).  \nFor any scheme (x1,x2) and my posterior best response π1 (buy only on σ=1 when the posterior of good quality exceeds 0.5), my expected payoff is R = (1/3)x2 – (2/3)x1 while the seller’s is S = (1/3)x2 + (2/3)x1, with the feasibility constraint x2 > 2x1 (so I buy only on σ=1).  \nIf I set a required payoff R* (induced by my announced φ1), the seller will choose a scheme that maximises S subject to R ≥ R*.  Given the monotonicities, she will pick x2=1 and raise x1 as far as the constraint allows, yielding x1 = (1 – 3R*)/2 and S = 1/3 + (2/3)x1.  Hence the highest receiver‑achievable threshold that is still feasible is R* = 1/3, which forces x1 = 0, x2 = 1, giving me R = 1/3 and the seller S = 1/3.  Any higher threshold would be infeasible; any lower threshold would only lower my final payoff.  \nTherefore I announce φ1 = (x1=0, x2=1).  If the seller adopts any scheme that gives me at least 1/3 expected reward, I will play π1 (buy on σ=1 only); otherwise I will revert to π0 (never buy).",

    "Analysis": "We want the buyer to purchase as many items as possible. The receiver’s announced scheme x1=0, x2=1 (recommend only good products) guarantees that the posterior probability of a good product after signal 1 is 1, so the buyer’s best‑response rule (pi_1) is: buy when σ = 1, don’t buy when σ = 0. This gives the buyer an expected payoff of 1/3. The receiver has declared that unless our scheme gives them at least this 1/3 payoff, they will ignore signals and never buy, leaving our expected sales at 0.  \nLet x1 be the probability of recommending a bad product and k = x1/x2. For the buyer to buy on σ = 1 we need x2 ≥ 2x1 (k ≤ 0.5). Their expected payoff would then be x2(1−2k)/3. To reach the required 1/3 we need x2(1−2k) ≥ 1, which is only possible with x2 = 1 and k = 0, i.e. x1 = 0. Any deviation (x1 > 0 or x2 < 1) drops the buyer’s expected payoff below 1/3; they would switch to π0 and we would sell nothing. Hence our best response is to accept the proposed truthful signaling scheme x1 = 0, x2 = 1, which yields us an expected sale probability of 1/3, the highest achievable under the receiver’s commitment.",

    "Analysis": "As the receiver‑proposer I can set a reservation signaling scheme φ₁ that the seller must meet; otherwise I fall back to ignoring signals (π₀ = never buy). If I ignore signals my expected payoff is 0 and the seller’s is 0, so the seller is eager to improve on this.\n\nMy best possible expected payoff is obtained when I only buy good products. That is achieved by the fully separating (truth‑telling) scheme x₁ = φ(σ=1|s=0)=0, x₂ = φ(σ=1|s=1)=1. With Bayesian best‑response (π₁: buy on σ=1, don’t buy on σ=0) my expected payoff is 1/3, while the seller obtains 1/3. Any scheme with x₁>0 lowers my payoff below 1/3, so 1/3 is the highest enforceable level.   \n\nBecause the seller’s fallback payoff is 0, and 1/3 > 0, the rational seller will accept this requirement and commit to the truthful scheme. Therefore I announce φ₁ = (0,1) with the stated commitment: if the seller adopts any scheme giving me at least 1/3 I will play π₁; otherwise I will revert to π₀.",

As a self‑interested buyer, the best response is to buy only when sigma=1 and never buy when sigma=0, since this yields an expected payoff of +1 for each sigma=1 product and 0 otherwise, giving overall expected payoff +1/3, which is higher than any strategy that buys in additional cases.",

    "Analysis": "As the receiver, my outside option (ignoring signals, π₀) is 0 because the prior makes buying strictly negative‑EV.  If I commit to follow π₁ (buy when posterior Pr(good|σ) ≥ 0.5, refuse otherwise), the sender can induce any (α,β)= (φ(1|0), φ(1|1)) with β ≥ 2α to make me buy on σ=1.  My ex‑ante payoff with β=1 is E_R = ((2/3)α+1/3)(1−2α)/(2α+1)= (1−2α)/3, maximised at α=0, yielding 1/3.  This corresponds to the fully separating scheme φ(1|0)=0, φ(1|1)=1: I buy only good products (prob. 1/3), getting +1 each, so my expected reward is 1/3.  Any α>0 lowers my payoff, so 1/3 is the highest utility I can demand while still allowing the sender a positive payoff (they sell 1/3 instead of 0).  Hence I set this as the threshold: if the sender adopts a scheme giving me ≥1/3 I will play π₁; otherwise I revert to π₀ (never buy).  Therefore I announce varphi₁ = (0,1).",

    "Analysis": "The sender’s announced scheme is fully separating: bad products always generate signal 0, good products always generate signal 1 (x1 = 0, x2 = 1).  Given this, the posterior probability that a product is good after signal 0 is 0, giving an expected payoff of –1 if I buy and 0 if I abstain, so I should not buy.  After signal 1 the posterior probability of a good product is 1, giving an expected payoff of +1 if I buy versus 0 if I abstain, so I should buy.  Therefore the best‑response action rule is to buy only on signal 1 and never buy on signal 0.",
