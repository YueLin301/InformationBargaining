    "Analysis": "As the proposer, my goal is to maximise my own payoff while ensuring the responder strictly prefers acceptance to rejection. A self‑interested rational responder will accept any offer that gives it a positive payoff, i.e. whenever 1−x>0. To make acceptance strictly better than rejection, I should leave the responder the smallest positive amount possible. Choosing x extremely close to 1 maximises my payoff while still guaranteeing acceptance. To avoid the tie‑breaking indifference at x=1, I offer the responder 0.001 and keep 0.999 for myself.",

 Now the proposer decides that x=0.999.
