A self‑interested responder will accept any offer that gives them strictly more than 0, and will be indifferent between accepting and rejecting if they receive exactly 0. To eliminate any risk of rejection caused by that indifference, I should leave the responder a tiny positive share. Offering myself x = 0.999 guarantees the responder 0.001, making acceptance strictly better for them and giving me an almost‑maximum payoff with virtually no risk of rejection.",
