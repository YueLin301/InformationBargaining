    "Analysis": "With a 0.1 chance of the game ending after each rejection and a hard stop at step 10, backward induction gives the responder’s continuation value at each step. Starting from step 9 (where the proposer can take everything), one gets the recursive rule E(t)=1−0.9 E(t+1). Working back to the present (t=0) yields E(0)≈0.3428. The responder’s minimum acceptable share is then 0.9 E(1)≈0.6572, so the largest x that will be accepted now is 1−0.6572≈0.3428. Any larger x would be rejected and gives me lower expected payoff (≈0.243) than immediate acceptance at 0.3428. Therefore I propose x=0.3428.",

    "Analysis": "As the proposer I want to keep as much as possible while still ensuring the responder prefers accepting to rejecting. Because there is a 0.1 chance of the game ending after each round, the effective discount factor per round is δ = 0.9. In the standard alternating‑offers bargaining solution, the responder’s continuation value if it rejects is W = δ / (1+δ) ≈ 0.4737. Therefore any offer that gives the responder at least 0.4737 will be accepted; otherwise it will be rejected. To avoid any risk created by rounding or indifference, I give the responder slightly more than this threshold, leaving myself just under the theoretical maximum. Thus I keep x = 0.525 and give the responder 0.475, which they should rationally accept because 0.475 > 0.4737.",

 Now the proposer decides that x=0.525.

    "Analysis": "There can be at most 10 bargaining rounds (t = 0 … 9).  After each rejected offer there is a 10 % chance that the game ends immediately; otherwise roles switch.  Let V_r be the expected payoff for the player who is the proposer with r rounds left.  Backward induction gives V_1 = 1 (last round proposer keeps everything).  For r ≥ 2, an offer that just makes the responder indifferent satisfies 1 – x = 0.9 V_{r‑1}, so V_r = x = 1 – 0.9 V_{r‑1}.  Iterating this:  V₂ = 0.1, V₃ ≈ 0.91, V₄ ≈ 0.181, V₅ ≈ 0.8371, V₆ ≈ 0.2466, V₇ ≈ 0.7781, V₈ ≈ 0.2998, V₉ ≈ 0.7302, V₁₀ ≈ 0.3428.  We are at the first round, so r = 10.  To secure acceptance while maximising our payoff we must set x = V₁₀ ≈ 0.343, giving the responder exactly its continuation value (0.657). Any higher x would be rejected; any lower x needlessly reduces our payoff.  Therefore the rational optimal proposal is x ≈ 0.343.",

Offering that amount makes the responder exactly indifferent between accepting now and rejecting to become next period’s proposer, so any higher x would be rejected while any lower x would unnecessarily reduce my payoff.

With δ = 0.9, this yields x* ≈ 0.526. Offering any larger x would give the responder less than its continuation value (≈0.474) and be rejected; offering any smaller x reduces my own payoff.

At t=1 the proposer’s equilibrium share is ≈0.7302, so the responder’s continuation value at t=0 is 0.9 × 0.7302 ≈ 0.6572. Hence, to make the responder just indifferent (and thus willing to accept), I should leave them 0.6572 and keep 0.3428 for myself. Offering any less risks rejection; offering more lowers my payoff. Therefore, the optimal offer is x ≈ 0.3428.",

    "Analysis": "This is an alternating‑offers bargaining game with a 10 % chance of exogenous termination after each round and a hard deadline at timestep 10 (no offer can be made then). Working backwards from the last possible offer (t=9), the proposer there can take the whole pie (x=1). Using backward induction and accounting for the 0.9 survival probability, the sequence of equilibrium proposer pay‑offs V_t satisfies V_t = 1 − 0.9·V_{t+1}. Solving gives V_9 = 1, V_8 = 0.1, V_7 ≈ 0.91, V_6 ≈ 0.181, V_5 ≈ 0.837, V_4 ≈ 0.247, V_3 ≈ 0.778, V_2 ≈ 0.300, V_1 ≈ 0.730, V_0 ≈ 0.343. At t=0 I am the proposer, and the responder’s continuation value if they reject is R_0 = 0.9·V_1 ≈ 0.657. Hence the largest offer the responder will accept satisfies 1 − x = 0.657, i.e. x ≈ 0.343. Offering this maximizes my expected payoff while keeping the responder indifferent (and therefore willing to accept).",

    "Analysis": "Accepting gives me 1 − x = 1 − 0.73022131 ≈ 0.2698. If I reject, there is a 0.1 chance the game ends (payoff 0) and a 0.9 chance I become the proposer next round. In the sub‑game‑perfect equilibrium of this alternating‑offer game with 0.1 breakdown probability, the proposer keeps about 0.5263, so my expected payoff when I next propose is 0.5263. Discounted back by the 0.9 survival probability, the rejection value is 0.9 × 0.5263 ≈ 0.4737, which is strictly higher than 0.2698. Therefore rejecting maximizes my expected payoff.",
    "Decision": 0
