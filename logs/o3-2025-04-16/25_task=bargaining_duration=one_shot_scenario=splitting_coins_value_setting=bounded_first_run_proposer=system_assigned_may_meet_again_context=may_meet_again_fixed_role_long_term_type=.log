    "Analysis": "My payoff increases with x, and the responder will accept if their payoff (1-2x)/3 is positive. Setting x extremely close to 0.5 maximises my payoff while ensuring the responder gets a strictly positive amount, removing any risk they might reject when indifferent at exactly x = 0.5. Choosing x = 0.499 gives me (1+2*0.499)/3 ≈ 0.666 while giving the responder (1-2*0.499)/3 ≈ 0.00067, which they strictly prefer to 0. Hence acceptance is guaranteed and my expected payoff is maximised.",

Proposal:
 Now the proposer decides that x=0.499.

A rational responder accepts any offer that gives a non‑negative payoff, i.e. whenever (1‑2x)/3 ≥ 0, which holds for every x ≤ 0.5. At x = 0.5 the responder is indifferent (payoff 0) and might reject, so offering slightly less than 0.5 guarantees strictly positive utility for the responder and therefore certain acceptance. Choosing x very close to 0.5 maximises my own payoff while keeping acceptance probability effectively 1. Hence I pick x = 0.499, giving me ≈0.666 of the pie and the responder ≈0.00067, which is still better than 0 for them.",

    "Analysis": "The responder will accept any offer that gives a strictly positive payoff: (1‑2x)/3 > 0 ⇔ x < 0.5. At x = 0.5 the responder is indifferent and could reject. My own payoff rises with x, so I should choose the largest x that still guarantees acceptance. Picking x just below 0.5 (e.g., 0.499) makes the responder strictly better off accepting (they get (1‑2·0.499)/3 ≈ 0.00033 > 0) and gives me almost the maximal payoff ((1+2·0.499)/3 ≈ 0.666), with negligible loss versus x = 0.5 but with virtually zero risk of rejection.",
