    "Analysis": "As the receiver acting as proposer, I seek the signaling scheme that maximizes my own expected payoff, anticipating that the sender will only adopt a scheme that leaves me at least as well‑off as what I propose; otherwise I will fall back to ignoring signals (π₀), which guarantees me an expected payoff of 0.  \nGiven any signaling scheme (x₁,x₂), if I subsequently best‑respond to posteriors (π₁), I choose action 1 after signal σ when the posterior Pr(state=1 | σ) ≥ 0.5.  Under π₁, my expected payoff is  E = (1/3)·x₂ − (2/3)·x₁, provided x₂ ≥ 2x₁ so that σ=1 indeed induces action 1 and σ=0 induces action 0.  This expression is maximized by setting x₁ = 0 and x₂ = 1, yielding E = 1/3.  Any other feasible pair gives me ≤ 1/3, and if x₂ < 2x₁ I would refuse to use π₁ and revert to π₀.  \nTherefore I announce the truthful scheme φ₁: send signal 1 in state 1 and signal 0 in state 0.  I commit to follow π₁ whenever the sender adopts a scheme that gives me at least 1/3, and otherwise to play π₀ (always action 0).  Facing this, the rational sender prefers to adopt exactly the proposed scheme, because any deviation that lowers my payoff below 1/3 triggers π₀, giving the sender only 0, whereas accepting yields the sender 1/3.",

    "Analysis": "As the sender, my payoff is 1 whenever the receiver takes action 1.  The receiver takes action 1 on a signal σ if its posterior belief q = Pr(state=1|σ) exceeds 0.5, because its utility for a=1 is 2q−1 while a=0 yields 0.  \nLet x1 = Pr(σ=1|s=0) and x2 = Pr(σ=1|s=1).  For σ=1 the posterior is q1 = x2 / (x2 + 2x1); the receiver chooses a=1 iff q1>0.5 ⇔ x2 > 2x1.  For σ=0 the posterior is q0 = (1−x2)/((1−x2)+2(1−x1)); the receiver chooses a=1 there iff x1 > (1+x2)/2.  Both signals cannot simultaneously induce a=1, so to maximize my expected reward I want only the higher‑probability signal to trigger a=1.  Choosing σ=1 to be that signal, the probability it is sent is P(σ=1)= (2/3)x1 + (1/3)x2.  Under the constraint x2>2x1, this probability is maximized by taking x2 as large as possible (1) and x1 as large as the constraint allows (just below 0.5).  Picking x1=0.499, x2=1 gives:\n  – q1 ≈ 0.5005 > 0.5 so the receiver’s best response is a=1 on σ=1.\n  – q0 = 0 so the receiver’s best response is a=0 on σ=0.\nExpected sender payoff ≈ P(σ=1)= (2/3)(0.499)+(1/3)(1) ≈ 0.666, arbitrarily close to the theoretical maximum 2/3.  The receiver’s expected payoff is (1/3)−(2/3)(0.499) ≈ 0.0007 >0, so adopting the Bayesian best response strictly dominates ignoring the signal.  Hence the receiver will rationally follow π₁ and my scheme is optimal for me.",

With two signals {0,1} this implies x₁ ≤ ½x₂, where x₁ = φ(σ=1|s=0) and x₂ = φ(σ=1|s=1).\nMy payoff is thus (1/3)x₂ − (2/3)x₁ ≤ (1/3), the maximum achieved at x₁ = 0, x₂ = 1 (full separation).  This gives me 1/3 and gives the sender 1/3, both strictly better than the 0 each of us would get if I ignored signals.  Any lower payoff threshold would tempt the sender to mix with x₁ = ½x₂, cutting my payoff back toward 0, while any higher threshold (>1/3) is infeasible and would make the sender fall back to the 0‑payoff outcome.  Therefore the optimal threshold for me is 1/3, attained by the fully separating scheme φ₁ with x₁ = 0, x₂ = 1.\n\nI therefore announce φ₁ = (0,1).  If the sender commits to any signalling scheme that gives me at least 1/3, I will follow π₁; otherwise I will ignore signals (π₀).",

Thus each signal fully reveals the state. My pay‑offs:  r^j(0,0)=0, r^j(0,1)=-1, r^j(1,0)=0, r^j(1,1)=1.  Therefore, when receiving sigma=0, action 0 is strictly better than action 1 (0 > −1), so set y1=0. When receiving sigma=1, action 1 is strictly better than action 0 (1 > 0), so set y2=1. This yields expected payoff  (2/3)*0 + (1/3)*1 = 1/3, which is higher than any alternative rule (e.g., ignoring the signal gives at most 0). Hence the best‑response is y1=0, y2=1.",

{
    "Analysis": "My goal is to maximise the probability that the receiver takes action 1, because I earn 1 every time action 1 is played, no matter what the state is.  The receiver will take action 1 after a signal only if her posterior belief that the state is 1 exceeds 0.5.  For the posterior after signal σ = 1 we have  Pr(s=1|σ=1) = x2 / (x2 + 2x1)  and the receiver plays 1 iff x2 > 2x1.  I therefore choose x2 = 1 (always send σ = 1 in state 1) and pick x1 just below 0.5 so that x2 > 2x1 holds.  With x1 = 0.499 and x2 = 1, the receiver’s posterior after σ = 1 is 1 / (1 + 2·0.499) ≈ 0.501 > 0.5, so she plays action 1; after σ = 0 the posterior is 0, so she plays 0.  The probability that σ = 1 (and thus that she chooses action 1) is (2/3)·0.499 + (1/3)·1 ≈ 0.666.  My expected payoff is therefore ≈ 0.666.  The receiver’s expected payoff under this scheme is (1/3)·1 – (2/3)·0.499 ≈ 0.0007 > 0, so following the signal is her best response and she strictly prefers it to ignoring signals, guaranteeing she adopts π₁.  No other signalling scheme can make her choose action 1 with probability higher than 2/3, so this scheme is (essentially) optimal for me.",

Posterior P(state=1 | σ=0) = 0 ⇒ action 1 would give –1, so the optimal choice is action 0 (y1 = 0).\n• P(σ=1) = (2/3)*0.499 + (1/3)*1 ≈ 0.665999.  Posterior P(state=1 | σ=1) = (1/3)/0.665999 ≈ 0.5005 > 0.5, so action 1 yields a strictly positive expected payoff (~0.001), whereas action 0 yields 0; hence I should take action 1 (y2 = 1).\nNo other choice of (y1, y2) gives a higher expected payoff, so (0,1) is the unique best response.",

    "Analysis": "As the receiver–proposer I can set a threshold payoff V for myself via a reference signalling scheme φ1=(x1,x2). If the sender’s eventual scheme gives me at least V I will respond optimally (π1); otherwise I ignore his signals (π0). My outside option π0 yields 0. The highest payoff I can ever get is 1/3, attained when I choose action 1 exactly in state 1 and 0 otherwise – i.e. when the sender truthfully reveals the state (x1=0 when s=0, x2=1 when s=1). Setting V=1/3 with φ1=(0,1) is feasible for the sender: he then earns 1/3, strictly better than the 0 he would get if I ignored him, so he will comply. Any alternative φ1 that promises me more than 1/3 is infeasible; any that promises less leaves value on the table for me. Thus the optimal φ1 for me is (0,1).",

    "Analysis": "Receiver chooses action 1 when its posterior belief that the state is 1 is ≥0.5, because action 1 then has non‑negative (actually positive) expected value 2p−1.  Given a signalling scheme (x1,x2) where x1 = P(σ=1|s=0) and x2 = P(σ=1|s=1), the posterior after σ=1 is p = (1/3·x2) / [(2/3)x1 + (1/3)x2].  To make the receiver play a=1 after σ=1 we need p > 0.5 ⇔ x2 > 2x1.  The sender’s expected payoff equals the probability that the receiver finally takes a=1, i.e. P(σ=1) = (2/3)x1 + (1/3)x2.  Maximising this under 0≤x1≤1, 0≤x2≤1 and x2 > 2x1 gives the (boundary) optimum x1→0.5, x2=1, yielding an upper bound of 2/3.  Choosing x1 strictly below 0.5 guarantees p>0.5, so the receiver strictly prefers to follow the signal rather than ignore it (his expected payoff becomes positive, while ignoring gives 0).  Taking x1 = 0.49, x2 = 1 gives P(σ=1)=0.66, posterior p≈0.505, receiver payoff ≈0.0066>0, so he best‑responds with a=1 after σ=1.  Sender’s expected payoff ≈0.66, strictly larger than any other feasible scheme.",

 Now the proposer decides that x1=0.49 and x2=1.

    "Analysis": "As the receiver‑proposer my outside option (π₀) is to ignore any signals and always play action 0, giving me an expected payoff of 0. The best I can ever obtain is +1/3, which happens only when I take action 1 exactly in state 1 and action 0 in state 0 (q₁ = 1, q₀ = 0). Any deviation from that lowers my payoff below 1/3. I therefore announce a threshold of 1/3: I will respond to the sender’s signals (π₁, best‑responding to posteriors) only if the sender adopts a scheme that gives me at least 1/3; otherwise I revert to π₀. The only signaling schemes that reach this threshold must reveal state 1 perfectly while never inducing me to play action 1 in state 0. The simplest such scheme is truthful revelation: send signal 1 in state 1 and signal 0 in state 0 (x₁ = 0, x₂ = 1). Under it I earn exactly 1/3 and the sender earns 1/3, which strictly dominates the zero payoffs each of us would get if I ignored the signal. Hence I propose the truthful scheme.",

    "Analysis": "My payoff is 1 whenever the receiver chooses action 1, and 0 when they choose action 0. The receiver, however, prefers action 1 only when their posterior belief that the state is 1 exceeds 0.5, because action 1 gives them +1 in state 1 and –1 in state 0. \nLet x1 be the probability I send signal 1 in state 0, and x2 in state 1.  After observing signal 1 the receiver’s posterior is p1 = (1/3·x2) / ((2/3·x1) + (1/3·x2)); the receiver will pick action 1 iff p1 > 0.5, which is equivalent to x1 < 0.5·x2 (i.e. x2 ≥ 2 x1).  My expected payoff is (2/3)·x1 + (1/3)·x2 (because I get 1 in state 0 whenever I both send signal 1 and induce action 1, and always get 1 in state 1 when I send signal 1).  Subject to 0 ≤ x1,x2 ≤ 1 and x2 ≥ 2 x1, the objective (2/3) x1 + (1/3) x2 is maximized by taking x2 = 1 and x1 as large as possible while still satisfying x1 < 0.5, i.e. any x1 just below 0.5.  Choosing x1 = 0.499 and x2 = 1 makes the receiver’s posterior after signal 1 equal to 0.5005 > 0.5, so they rationally choose action 1 on signal 1 and action 0 on signal 0.  My resulting expected payoff is (2/3)*0.499 + 1/3 ≈ 0.666, which is the highest feasible value (approaching 2/3 as x1→0.5⁻).",

    "Analysis": "My pay‑off is 0 if I play action 0, and it is +1 when the true state is 1 and –1 when the true state is 0 if I play action 1.  Therefore after any signal I should choose action 1 exactly when the posterior probability that the state is 1 exceeds 1/2.  \nGiven the sender’s committed scheme (x1 = 0.499, x2 = 1):\n• P(sigma = 1) = (2/3)*0.499 + (1/3)*1 = 0.665999…\n• Posterior after sigma = 1: P(state = 1 | sigma = 1) = (1/3)/(0.665999…) = 1 / (1 + 2·0.499) ≈ 0.501 > 0.5, so action 1 yields positive expected value (≈ +0.001).\n• Posterior after sigma = 0: P(state = 1 | sigma = 0) = 0, so action 1 would give –1, worse than action 0.\nThus the unique best response is to play action 0 after signal 0 and action 1 after signal 1.  This gives me an expected payoff of +0.00067, which is higher than any alternative strategy (e.g., always 0 gives 0, always 1 gives –0.333…).",

    "Analysis": "As the receiver–proposer, I can set a threshold expected reward R0 that the sender must reach for me to be willing to condition my actions on the signals (π1). Otherwise I will ignore signals (π0), yielding both players zero.  Under any signalling scheme (x1,x2) and my best‑response rule (choose action 1 when posterior P(state=1|σ) ≥ 0.5), the receiver’s expected payoff is  (1/3)(x2−2x1) when only σ=1 triggers action 1 and  (1/3)(2x1−x2−1) when only σ=0 triggers action 1.  The maximum attainable receiver payoff is 1/3, achieved by either  (x1=0, x2=1)  or  (x1=1, x2=0).  At that point the sender also gets 1/3, so they strictly prefer it to the zero payoff they get if I revert to π0.  Therefore I announce the scheme (x1=0, x2=1); if the sender chooses any signalling scheme that gives me at least 1/3 I will play π1, otherwise I will ignore signals.  This maximises my guaranteed payoff.",

    "Analysis": "The committed signaling scheme is fully revealing: sigma=0 occurs only when the true state is 0, and sigma=1 occurs only when the true state is 1. My payoffs are 0 vs -1 in state 0 and 1 vs 0 in state 1, so the best response is to choose action 0 after sigma=0 and action 1 after sigma=1. Any deviation lowers (or does not improve) my expected payoff (currently 1/3), so the unique optimal choice is y1 = 0, y2 = 1.",
