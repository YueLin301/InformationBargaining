{
    "Analysis": "My goal is to maximize the probability that the receiver ends up choosing action 1, because I always obtain 1 whenever action 1 is taken and 0 otherwise.  The receiver will pick action 1 only when her posterior belief that the true state is 1 exceeds 0.5.  Let x1 := P(σ=1 | s=0) and x2 := P(σ=1 | s=1).  With prior P(s=1)=1/3, the posterior after signal σ=1 is p1 = 1 / (2 x1 + 1).  The receiver will therefore play action 1 after σ=1 iff p1>0.5, i.e. iff x2>2 x1 (since I will set x2=1).  I want P(σ=1) = (2/3) x1 + (1/3) x2 to be as large as possible subject to x2>2 x1 and x2≤1.  Setting x2=1 and pushing x1 as close as possible to 0.5 from below maximises this probability, giving an expected payoff for me arbitrarily close to 2/3 while still satisfying the inequality strictly so the receiver indeed chooses action 1 on σ=1.  Choosing x1 = 0.49 and x2 = 1 yields P(σ=1)≈0.66, my expected payoff ≈0.66, and the receiver’s expected payoff ≈0.0067>0, so she strictly prefers to follow the posterior–best‑response rule π₁ rather than ignore the signal.  Hence the receiver will comply, and the scheme is optimal for me.",

    "Analysis": "As the sender my payoff is 1 when the receiver chooses action 1 and 0 otherwise. The receiver prefers action 1 only when the posterior probability of state 1 is at least 1/2.  \nLet x1 = Pr(σ = 1 | s = 0) and x2 = Pr(σ = 1 | s = 1).  \nFor the receiver to play a best‑response mapping (y1 = 0 after σ = 0 and y2 = 1 after σ = 1) we need the posterior on σ = 1 to exceed 1/2, i.e. x2 > 2 x1.  \nUnder that response my expected payoff is q₁ = Pr(σ = 1) = (2/3) x1 + (1/3) x2.  \nSubject to x2 > 2 x1 and 0 ≤ x1,x2 ≤ 1, q₁ is maximised by taking x1 as close to 0.5 as possible from below and x2 = 1, which makes q₁ approach 2/3 while keeping the receiver’s posterior strictly above 1/2 (so the receiver strictly prefers to pay attention).  \nChoosing x1 = 0.49 and x2 = 1 satisfies x2 > 2 x1, gives q₁ ≈ 0.66 for me, posterior P(s=1|σ=1) ≈ 0.505 for the receiver, and a strictly positive expected payoff for the receiver (≈ 0.0066), so the receiver’s unique best response is indeed y1 = 0, y2 = 1.  \nNo other feasible (x1,x2) can yield a higher expected payoff for me without violating the receiver’s rationality constraint, so (0.49,1) is (approximately) optimal.",

    "Analysis": "As the sender I earn 1 whenever the receiver takes action 1, otherwise 0.  The receiver earns 1 if state=1 & action=1, −1 if state=0 & action=1, and 0 if action=0.  The receiver therefore plays action 1 on a signal σ only if the posterior Pr(state=1 | σ) ≥ 0.5, because his expected payoff from action 1 is 2·Pr(state=1|σ)−1.  \n\nLet x1 = φ(σ=1|s=0) and x2 = φ(σ=1|s=1).  For signal 1 the posterior is p(1|σ=1)=x2/(x2+2x1).  To make the receiver choose action 1 on σ=1 we need x2 > 2x1.  The sender’s expected payoff is Pr(σ=1)= (2/3)·x1 + (1/3)·x2, so we want x1 as large as possible subject to x2 ≤1 and x2 > 2x1.  Setting x2=1 maximises payoff; this allows x1 to approach 0.5 from below.  Choosing x1 = 0.49 and x2 = 1 satisfies x2 > 2x1 (1>0.98) and gives\n  – Pr(σ=1)= (2/3)·0.49 + (1/3)·1 ≈ 0.66, which is my expected payoff.\n  – Posterior on σ=1: 1/(1+0.98) ≈ 0.505 > 0.5, so the receiver strictly prefers action 1 on σ=1.\n  – Posterior on σ=0 is 0, so the receiver strictly prefers action 0 there.\n  – Receiver’s overall expected payoff ≈ 0.66·0.01 = 0.0066 > 0, so he is better off responding to the signal (π1) than ignoring it (π0, payoff 0).  No other rule can yield more, because best‑reply is already achieved signal‑wise.\n\nThus the receiver will rationally use π1, I obtain ≈0.66 expected reward, and the scheme is optimal up to the ε‑margin created by keeping x1<0.5.

    "Analysis": "If the receiver ignores signals (π₀) he always plays a = 0 and both players get 0.  If he conditions on signals (π₁) he will play a = 1 after a signal σ when the posterior Pr(s = 1 | σ) ≥ 1/2.  Let x₁ = φ(σ = 1 | s = 0) and x₂ = φ(σ = 1 | s = 1).  The posterior after σ = 1 is x₂ / (x₂ + 2x₁); the receiver therefore chooses a = 1 after σ = 1 iff x₂ ≥ 2x₁.  His expected payoff from following π₁ is –(2/3)x₁ + (1/3)x₂, which is ≥ 0 exactly when the same inequality x₂ ≥ 2x₁ holds.  Hence, to make him strictly prefer π₁ over π₀ we pick x₂ > 2x₁.  Our own expected payoff under π₁ is (2/3)x₁ + (1/3)x₂.  Subject to 0 ≤ x₁ ≤ 1/2, x₂ = 1 and x₂ > 2x₁, this payoff is maximised by pushing x₁ as high as possible while keeping the inequality strict.  Choosing x₁ = 0.49, x₂ = 1 gives receiver payoff ≈ 0.0067 > 0, so he follows π₁ (playing a = 1 after σ = 1, a = 0 after σ = 0).  Our expected payoff is (2/3)(0.49) + (1/3)(1) ≈ 0.66, which is essentially the maximum attainable (upper bound 2/3) while ensuring the receiver’s strict incentive.",

Hence, P(s = 1 | σ = 1) = (1/3)/0.66 ≈ 0.505 > 0.5, so action 1 yields positive expected payoff after σ = 1.  For σ = 0 we have P(s = 1 | σ = 0) = 0, so action 0 is optimal.  Therefore the posterior‑best‑response rule π₁ that maximizes my expected reward is to choose a = 0 after σ = 0 and a = 1 after σ = 1.  Any deviation (including ignoring the signal) weakly decreases my payoff, so the unique rational choice is y₁ = 0, y₂ = 1.",

    "Analysis": "The receiver will compare the posterior probability p=Pr(state=1|signal) with the 0.5 threshold.  If p>0.5 she plays action 1 (payoff 1 vs –1), otherwise action 0 (payoff 0).  Let x1 = φ(σ=1|s=0) and x2 = φ(σ=1|s=1).  For signal σ=1 the posterior is p1 = x2/(2x1+x2); the receiver will play a=1 iff p1>0.5 ⇔ x2>2x1.  For σ=0 the posterior is p0 = (1–x2)/(3–2x1–x2); she will play a=1 iff p0>0.5 ⇔ 2x1–x2>1.  Both inequalities cannot hold simultaneously, so at most one signal induces a=1.  The sender’s expected payoff is E = (2/3)x1 + (1/3)x2, attained when σ=1 induces a=1 and σ=0 induces a=0, i.e. when x2>2x1.  With x2 bounded above by 1, E is maximised by choosing x1 just below 0.5 and x2=1.  Picking x1=0.499 and x2=1 gives x2>2x1 (1>0.998), induces the desired best‑response by the receiver (a=1 on σ=1, a=0 on σ=0), yields the sender an expected payoff ≈0.666, and gives the receiver a weakly positive payoff so she prefers to use the signal rather than ignore it.",

    "Analysis": "Given the sender’s committed scheme (x1=0.499, x2=1), the posterior belief after observing the signal is:\n• P(s=1 | σ=0)=0, because state 1 always sends σ=1.\n• P(s=1 | σ=1)= (1/3)/( (2/3)*0.499 + 1/3 ) = 1/1.998 ≈ 0.5005.\nIf I take action 1, my conditional expected payoff is 2·P(s=1|σ)−1.  For σ=0 this is −1 (strictly negative), so the best response is action 0.  For σ=1 it is ≈ +0.001 (positive), so the best response is action 1.  Mixing would strictly lower my expected payoff because the coefficient on y₂ is positive and on y₁ is negative.  Hence the optimal rule is y₁=0, y₂=1, giving a small positive overall expected payoff ≈ 0.00067, which is higher than the 0 obtained by ignoring the signal.",

    "Analysis": "My payoff equals the probability that the receiver chooses action 1. The receiver will pick action 1 on a signal only when his posterior Pr(state = 1 | signal) exceeds 0.5, because action‑1 gives him expected value 2p−1. So I want to create one signal with posterior > 0.5 (he then plays 1) and the other with posterior ≤ 0.5 (he plays 0). Let x1 = Pr(signal=1 | state=0) and x2 = Pr(signal=1 | state=1). Posterior for signal 1 is p = x2 / (x2 + 2x1); I need p > 0.5 → x2 > 2x1. My expected payoff is (2/3)x1 + (1/3)x2, increasing in both x1 and x2, so I set x2 = 1 (its maximum) and push x1 as high as allowed by x2 > 2x1, i.e. x1 just under 0.5. Choosing x1 = 0.49 and x2 = 1 gives posterior 0.505 > 0.5 for signal 1 and 0 for signal 0. The receiver’s expected payoff with posterior best‑response is (1/3)·1 − (2/3)·0.49 ≈ 0.0063 > 0, better than ignoring signals (which yields 0), so he will follow the posterior rule. My expected payoff is (2/3)·0.49 + (1/3)·1 ≈ 0.6597. This is arbitrarily close to the theoretical maximum 2/3 while keeping the receiver strictly preferring the informative strategy.",

After signal 1, the posterior probability of state 1 is (1/3)/(0.66) ≈ 0.505 > 0.5, making action 1 strictly better (expected value ≈ 0.010 > 0). Thus the best‑response rule that maximizes my expected payoff is to choose action 0 on signal 0 and action 1 on signal 1. This yields an overall expected payoff ≈ 0.0067, strictly higher than ignoring the signal (which would give 0).",

    "Analysis": "The sender wants the receiver to choose action 1 as often as possible, because the sender’s payoff is 1 whenever the receiver plays action 1 (and 0 otherwise).  The receiver, however, will only take action 1 when her posterior belief that the true state is 1 is at least 0.5.  \n\nLet x1 = Pr(σ = 1 | s = 0) and x2 = Pr(σ = 1 | s = 1).  After observing σ = 1, the receiver’s posterior is\n    p1 = (1/3 · x2) / [(2/3 · x1) + (1/3 · x2)]\nThe receiver will play a = 1 on signal 1 when p1 ≥ 0.5, which is equivalent to x2 ≥ 2 x1.  On signal 0 the posterior is 0, so the receiver plays a = 0 there.  \n\nThe sender’s expected payoff is Pr(a = 1) = (2/3)·x1 + (1/3)·x2.  Subject to x2 ≥ 2 x1 ≤ 1, this expression is maximised by pushing x1 as high as possible and x2 to 1.  Because x2 ≤ 1, the largest admissible x1 is just below 0.5.  Choosing x1 = 0.49 and x2 = 1 gives:\n  • Sender payoff  E[r^i] = (2/3)·0.49 + (1/3)·1 ≈ 0.660.\n  • Receiver payoff when she responds to posteriors is  (1/3)·1 − (2/3)·0.49 ≈ 0.006 > 0, so she strictly prefers using the posterior‐based rule π1 to ignoring the signal (which would give 0).  \nThus the receiver’s best response is to play a = 1 after σ = 1 and a = 0 after σ = 0, and the sender obtains an expected payoff of about 0.66, close to the theoretical maximum 2/3.  Any deviation by the sender would weakly reduce this payoff.  Therefore the rational signalling scheme is: send σ = 1 with probability 0.49 in state 0 and with probability 1 in state 1.",

    "Analysis": "My objective as the sender is to maximise the probability that the receiver chooses action 1, because I always earn 1 when the receiver plays action 1 and 0 otherwise.  The receiver, however, will only play action 1 when its posterior belief that the state is 1 exceeds 0.5 (since its payoff from action 1 is 2·Pr(state=1|σ) − 1).  \n\nLet x1 = Pr(σ=1 | s=0) and x2 = Pr(σ=1 | s=1).  After observing σ=1 the posterior is\n      Pr(s=1 | σ=1) = (1/3·x2) / (1/3·x2 + 2/3·x1) = x2 / (x2 + 2x1).\nFor the receiver to choose action 1 on σ=1 we need x2 > 2x1.  Under this condition the receiver’s best response is:\n      • play a=1 when σ=1 (posterior > 0.5),\n      • play a=0 when σ=0 (posterior < 0.5).\nMy expected payoff is then P(σ=1) = (2/3)x1 + (1/3)x2.  To maximise this subject to x2 > 2x1 and x2≤1, we set x2 as large as possible (1) and x1 as close to 0.5 as the constraint allows.  Choosing x1 = 0.499 and x2 = 1 satisfies x2 > 2x1 and yields expected payoff ≈ 0.6657, arbitrarily close to the theoretical maximum 2/3.  \n\nWith these numbers the receiver’s expected payoff is positive (≈ 0.00035), so the receiver strictly prefers following the posterior‑best‑response rule π₁ rather than ignoring the signal (which would give 0).  Hence the receiver’s rational choice is to use π₁, and my scheme is optimal for me.",

    "Analysis": "Given the sender’s committed scheme (x1 = 0.499, x2 = 1), we compute posteriors for each signal. For sigma = 0 the posterior puts probability 1 on state 0, so action 0 (payoff 0) strictly dominates action 1 (payoff −1); hence y1 = 0. For sigma = 1 the posterior is P(s=1 | sigma=1) = 0.5 and P(s=0 | sigma=1) = 0.499, giving expected payoff from action 1 equal to 0.5 − 0.499 = 0.001, while action 0 yields 0. Therefore action 1 is strictly (though slightly) better, so y2 = 1. This choice maximizes my expected utility, giving overall E[r^j] ≈ 0.000667, which is higher than any alternative mix.",

    "Analysis": "Sender’s payoff equals the probability that the receiver takes action 1.  \nReceiver will best‑respond to the posterior belief p(state=1 | signal).  \nHe plays action 1 iff p ≥ 0.5; otherwise he plays 0.  \nLet x1 = P(signal=1 | state=0) and x2 = P(signal=1 | state=1).  \nPosterior after signal 1 is p1 = x2 / (x2 + 2x1).  \nTo induce action 1 on signal 1 we need p1 > 0.5 ⇒ x2 > 2x1.  \nSender’s objective Prob(signal=1) = (2/3)x1 + (1/3)x2 is linear and increases in both x1, x2, so maximise x1 subject to x2 > 2x1 and x2 ≤ 1.  \nSetting x2=1, the largest admissible x1 is just below 0.5.  \nChoose x1 = 0.499, x2 = 1.  \nThen p1 ≈ 0.5005 > 0.5, so the receiver strictly prefers action 1 on signal 1; on signal 0 he prefers action 0.  \nReceiver’s expected payoff is ≈ 0.0067, strictly higher than the 0 he would get from ignoring signals, so his rational best response is the posterior‑based policy π1.  \nSender’s expected payoff is (2/3)x1 + (1/3)x2 ≈ 0.666, close to the theoretical maximum 2/3.  \nThus (x1,x2)=(0.499,1) is a payoff‑maximising secure signalling scheme for the sender.",

For σ = 0, Pr(s=1 | σ=0) = 0, so action 1 gives –1 < 0 while action 0 gives 0.  Hence the receiver’s best response is to choose action 0 after σ = 0 and action 1 after σ = 1.  This corresponds to y1 = 0, y2 = 1.  Any deviation (e.g., mixing after σ = 0 or reducing the probability of action 1 after σ = 1) lowers or (at best) does not increase expected payoff, so this is the unique optimal action rule.",

    "Analysis": "My reward is 1 whenever the receiver takes action 1, and 0 otherwise. The receiver prefers action 1 only if its posterior belief that the true state is 1 is above 0.5; otherwise it plays action 0.  \nLet x1 = P(σ=1 | s=0) and x2 = P(σ=1 | s=1).  \nPosterior when σ=1 is  P(s=1|σ=1)=1/(2x1+1).  The receiver will choose action 1 after σ=1 iff this posterior exceeds 0.5, i.e. x2 > 2x1.  \nPosterior when σ=0 is 0 if x2=1, so the receiver then chooses action 0.  \nMy expected payoff equals P(σ=1)= (2/3)x1 + (1/3)x2.  Under the constraint x2 > 2x1, this is maximised by taking the largest feasible x1 and x2=1, giving a value approaching 2/3.  Choosing x2=1 and x1 just below 0.5 (e.g. 0.49) satisfies x2 > 2x1, makes the receiver’s expected payoff (1/3)(x2−2x1) ≈ 0.0067 > 0, so the receiver strictly prefers to follow the posterior‑based rule (play a=1 after σ=1, a=0 after σ=0) rather than ignore the signal.  Hence the receiver’s best response is y1=0, y2=1, and my expected payoff becomes (2/3)·0.49+1/3 ≈ 0.66, essentially the maximum achievable 2/3 limit.  ",
