From now on, the responder compares whatever we offer with what it expects to get in later rounds. In the final possible round (t = 4) I can always secure acceptance by offering an infinitesimal ε > 0 to the responder, i.e. x = 0.5−ε. Working backward, the responder therefore never expects more than an arbitrarily small positive amount in any future round, so it will accept any current offer that gives it a strictly positive payoff. My best strategy is to keep x as close to 0.5 as possible while leaving the responder a tiny positive share. Choosing x = 0.4999 gives me (1+2·0.4999)/3 ≈ 0.6666 and gives the responder (1−2·0.4999)/3 ≈ 0.0000667, which is positive and better than its continuation value. Hence the responder should accept and I maximize my expected payoff.",

The responder will accept any offer that gives it a strictly positive payoff, i.e. any x < 0.5, because rejection yields 0 now and in all future rounds (the rational prediction is that I can always push x to 0.5 in the final round). If I choose x = 0.5 the responder is indifferent (gets 0) and may reject, risking both of us ending with nothing. By shaving x slightly below 0.5 I guarantee the responder a small positive amount, making acceptance strictly better than rejection, while my own payoff remains almost maximal. The marginal drop from x = 0.5 to x = 0.49 costs me only 0.0067, worth the near‑certain agreement.",

    "Analysis": "The responder will accept an offer if the payoff it receives is at least as large as what it expects to receive in the future. Because there are only four proposals left (t=1,2,3,4) and in the very last round I can still insist on x = 0.5 (giving the responder 0), the responder’s continuation value from rejecting now is 0. Therefore it will accept any offer with x < 0.5, since that gives it a strictly positive payoff. Offering x = 0.49 leaves the responder with (1‑2·0.49)/3 = 0.02/3 > 0, so acceptance is strictly preferred to rejection. My own payoff becomes (1+2·0.49)/3 = 1.98/3 = 0.66, only slightly below the theoretical maximum 2/3 but with a much higher likelihood of immediate acceptance. Hence x = 0.49 is the rational payoff‑maximising choice.",

    "Analysis": "My first two very greedy offers (x = 0.50 and x = 0.49) were both rejected, so the responder clearly requires a noticeably positive share. Offering tiny amounts (< 0.01) will almost certainly be rejected again. I still want the largest x that the responder is likely to accept so I keep reducing x until the responder’s payoff reaches roughly 0.10, which is a reasonable lower bound that should be attractive compared with the certain 0 they get by continuing to reject. At x = 0.34 the responder receives (1 - 2*0.34)/3 = 0.1067, while I receive (1 + 2*0.34)/3 = 0.56. This sacrifices only a small amount of my own payoff relative to riskier, higher‑x offers but greatly increases the acceptance probability this round, avoiding the danger of ending with zero after more rejections.",
