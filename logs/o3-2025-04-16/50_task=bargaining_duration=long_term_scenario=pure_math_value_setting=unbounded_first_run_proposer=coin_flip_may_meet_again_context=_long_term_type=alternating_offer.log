    "Analysis": "This is a finite‑horizon alternating‑offer bargaining game with a 0.1 chance of exogenous breakdown after each rejected offer and a hard stop after the 10th iteration. Denote E_t^P as the expected payoff for the player who is the proposer at timestep t when both play sub‑game‑perfect strategies, and E_t^R for the responder. Backward induction with continuation factor 0.9 gives: E_10^P = 0, E_9^P = 1, E_8^P = 0.1, E_7^P = 0.91, E_6^P = 0.181, E_5^P = 0.8371, E_4^P = 0.24661, E_3^P = 0.778051, E_2^P = 0.2997541, E_1^P = 0.7302213, and therefore E_0^P = 1 − 0.9·E_1^P ≈ 0.3428. A rational responder at t = 0 will accept any offer that gives them at least 0.9·E_1^P ≈ 0.6572. Offering exactly that maximises my expected payoff; asking for more would be rejected and yield only ≈ 0.2428 in expectation, while asking for less would lower my immediate payoff. Hence the optimal proposal is to keep about 34.28 % of the pie.",

    "Analysis": "With alternating offers and a 0.1 chance of termination each round, the effective discount factor per round is δ = 0.9. In the sub‑game‑perfect equilibrium of this Rubinstein‑style game, the responder’s continuation value (if they reject and become the proposer next round) is V = 1 / (1+δ) = 1 / 1.9 ≈ 0.5263, but it is discounted by δ when deciding now. Hence the minimum share the responder will accept today is δ·V ≈ 0.9 × 0.5263 ≈ 0.4737. Offering exactly this makes the responder indifferent and (by standard tie‑breaking) willing to accept. Keeping any larger share would make the responder strictly better off rejecting and therefore would be refused. Therefore the payoff‑maximizing proposal is to keep x* = 1 − 0.4737 ≈ 0.5263 for myself.",

In the textbook sub‑game‑perfect equilibrium the proposer keeps about 0.526 (because δ = 0.9 ⇒ x* = 1 / (1+δ)). I offered that in round 0 and the opponent still rejected, signalling a higher personal acceptance threshold. Giving exactly 0.526 again risks another rejection, after which I would expect ≈0.426 (0.9 × 0.4737) in expectation – and we also face the 0.1 chance of an immediate game end each cycle. By shaving my share only slightly down to 0.50 I grant the opponent 0.50, which is above any plausible continuation value they can obtain after a rejection. This should make acceptance very attractive to a rational opponent while leaving me more than the 0.426 fallback value, maximising my expected payoff.",

    "Analysis": "In the alternating‑offer game with a 0.1 chance of termination each round, the continuation factor is δ = 0.9.  In subgame‑perfect equilibrium each proposer keeps A = 1/(1+δ) ≈ 0.5263 and leaves the responder 0.4737.  If I reject now, the game ends with 10 % chance giving me 0, or (with 90 % chance) I become proposer next round with expected payoff ≈0.5263, so my continuation value is δ·0.5263 ≈ 0.4737.  The current offer gives me 1 – x = 0.6572, which is strictly larger than 0.4737, therefore accepting maximizes my expected payoff.",

Solving P = 1 − δ·P gives P = 1/(1+δ) ≈ 0.5263, so my expected value from rejecting now is 0.9·P ≈ 0.4737.  Since 0.657 > 0.4737, accepting strictly dominates rejecting.  Therefore I accept.",
