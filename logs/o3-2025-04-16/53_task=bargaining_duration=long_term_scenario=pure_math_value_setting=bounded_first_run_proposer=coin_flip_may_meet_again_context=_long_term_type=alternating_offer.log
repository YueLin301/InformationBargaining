    "Analysis": "Backward induction with a 0.9 survival probability and a hard stop at t = 10 shows an alternating pattern. At t = 1 the next proposer’s value is 2/3, so the current responder’s outside option at t = 0 is 0.9 × 2/3 = 0.6. The best payoff a responder can ever get from accepting is (1‑2x)/3 ≤ 1/3, which is below 0.6. Hence a rational responder will reject any admissible offer this round, giving the proposer an expected payoff of 0 no matter what x is. Given that, the proposer might as well choose the x that would give the highest payoff if the responder made a mistake and accepted; that is x = 0.5, yielding 2/3 to the proposer on acceptance.",

    "Analysis": "Each round has a 0.9 chance of continuing, so the discount factor is δ = 0.9.  Let P be the equilibrium payoff of the proposer this round and Q the payoff of the responder.  If the responder rejects, they expect to become the proposer next round and obtain δ·P.  Hence the responder will accept an offer that gives them at least Q = δ·P.  Because the total payoff when an offer is accepted is always (1+2x)/3 + (1‑2x)/3 = 2/3, we have P + Q = 2/3.  Solving P + 0.9 P = 2/3 gives P ≈ 0.351 and Q ≈ 0.316.  Setting (1+2x)/3 = P yields x ≈ 0.0265.  Offering this makes the responder exactly indifferent between accepting and rejecting; any larger x would be rejected and any smaller x lowers my own payoff.  Therefore the optimal rational proposal is x ≈ 0.0265.",

If I reject, there is a 0.1 chance the game ends right away (payoff 0) and a 0.9 chance I become the proposer next round.  As proposer next round, the subgame‑perfect equilibrium offer I could make (mirroring the 0.0263 pattern) would give me ≈0.3509, but this is multiplied by the 0.9 continuation probability, yielding expected payoff 0.9*0.3509 ≈ 0.3158 – exactly the same as accepting, but with risk.  Because accepting provides the same expected value without any risk of immediate termination, it is weakly better.  Therefore I accept.",

{
    "Analysis": "To be accepted, the responder must receive at least the value they expect from rejecting. Working backward from the last possible round (t=9), we find: at t=9 the responder’s outside option is 0, so any offer is accepted and the proposer keeps x=0.5. Therefore V_p(9)=2/3, V_r(9)=0. At t=8 the responder’s outside value is 0.9*(2/3)=0.6, which exceeds the maximum 1/3 they can ever be offered, so every offer is rejected and V_p(8)=0. This alternating pattern continues: all even timesteps (including the current t=0) end in certain rejection, because the responder’s outside option is 0.6, while all odd timesteps end in immediate acceptance with x=0.5. Hence whatever I offer now will be rejected, giving me an expected payoff of 0. Any x in [0,0.5] is therefore payoff‑equivalent to me, and x=0.5 maximizes my payoff should the responder deviate from rationality. Choosing x=0.5 is thus weakly optimal.",

    "Analysis": "From this point on, any rejected offer yields me 0 now and, with 0.9 probability, the discounted value of being the responder next round.  Denote V = my expected payoff when I am the proposer and W when I am the responder.  In equilibrium the proposer makes the minimum offer the responder is willing to accept, so (1‑2x)/3 = W and my payoff becomes V = (1+2x)/3.  If the offer were rejected, the responder becomes the proposer next turn, giving him expected value V, discounted by 0.9, so W = 0.9 V.  Solving V = (1+2x)/3 and (1‑2x)/3 = 0.9 V simultaneously gives V ≈ 0.3509, W ≈ 0.3158 and x* = (1‑3W)/2 ≈ 0.0263.  Any x larger than 0.0263 makes the responder’s share fall below his continuation value, so he would rationally reject, leaving me an expected payoff of only 0.9 W ≈ 0.284 (< 0.351).  Any x smaller than 0.0263 is accepted but yields me less than the maximum attainable 0.351.  Therefore the optimal rational offer is x = 0.0263.",

Let V be the expected payoff of the player whose turn it is to propose.  If the responder is indifferent, (1‑2x)/3 = 0.9 V.  The proposer’s payoff is then V = (1+2x)/3.  Solving these two equations gives V = 2/5.7 ≈ 0.350877 and the maximal x that will be accepted is x = (1–2.7 V)/2 ≈ 0.026316.  Offering any larger x would be rejected, leaving me with the lower continuation value 0.9 V ≈ 0.315789.  Therefore the best rational move is to set x ≈ 0.0263, which will be accepted and yields me ≈ 0.3509, strictly better than any other strategy.",

If the responder rejects, there is a 0.1 chance the game ends immediately with both of us getting 0, and a 0.9 chance the roles switch and the responder becomes the proposer at t = 4.  By backward induction (working from the latest possible offer at t = 9 where the proposer can take x = 0.5 and be accepted), the expected payoff for the proposer at t = 4 is 0.  Hence the responder’s continuation value after rejecting at t = 3 is 0.  The responder will accept any offer that gives strictly positive payoff, i.e. any x < 0.5.  Offering x = 0.499 gives the responder a tiny but strictly positive payoff ((1‑2·0.499)/3 ≈ 0.00067) so acceptance is strictly better for them than rejecting.  Our own payoff with x = 0.499 is (1+2·0.499)/3 ≈ 0.666, only 0.001 less than the theoretical maximum 0.667 when x = 0.5, but with virtually 100 % acceptance instead of uncertain acceptance when the responder is indifferent.  Therefore x = 0.499 maximizes our expected payoff among feasible offers.",

Offering x = 0 guarantees them that maximal 1/3 and should therefore be accepted. This secures me 1/3 now, avoiding any further risk of the game ending with zero.",

Proposal:
 Now the proposer decides that x=0.

    "Analysis": "We’re at timestep 5 (odd).  If the responder rejects, there’s a 10 % chance the game ends immediately and, with 90 % probability, roles switch to timestep 6 where the new proposer (the current responder) can expect zero in equilibrium.  Hence the rational continuation value for the responder from rejecting right now is 0.  Any offer that gives the responder a strictly positive payoff should therefore be accepted.  Past behaviour shows the opponent has so far rejected every proposal that left them with a very small or moderate share, so offering a tiny positive amount risks another rejection.  Offering x = 0 leaves each of us 1/3, which is strictly better for the responder than the 0 they expect from rejecting and therefore should be accepted with certainty, giving me an immediate guaranteed payoff of 1/3.  That dominates riskier, higher‑x proposals whose acceptance is uncertain.",

In sub‑game‑perfect equilibrium the responder accepts any offer that gives at least as much as the expected continuation value δ·V_P, where V_P is the proposer’s equilibrium payoff.  Setting the responder’s acceptance payoff (1‑2x)/3 equal to δ·V_P and recognising V_P = (1+2x)/3 yields 1‑2x = δ(1+2x).  Solving for x gives x = (1‑δ)/(2(1+δ)) ≈ 0.0263.  Any larger x would be rejected and leave me with the lower discounted continuation payoff; any smaller x lowers my own immediate payoff.  Therefore the optimal proposal is x ≈ 0.0263, giving me about 0.351 and the responder about 0.316, which the responder prefers to rejection.",

Hence any offer we make now (t=0) will be rejected with certainty; our own expected payoff this round is therefore the rejection continuation value 0.9·0 = 0. Thus the actual number x we state is payoff‑irrelevant to us, but if the responder were to make an error we would like the largest possible payoff, so we state x = 0.5.",

If the responder rejects, with probability 0.9 the game continues and the responder becomes the next proposer, so the responder’s outside option is δ·V_P.  Therefore an equilibrium offer must give the responder exactly δ·V_P and the proposer the rest:  V_P = 2/3 − δ·V_P  ⇒ V_P(1+δ) = 2/3  ⇒  V_P = 0.350877… and V_R = δ·V_P = 0.315789….

    "Analysis": "Backward induction shows an alternating‑pattern equilibrium. At each even timestep (0,2,4,…), the responder’s continuation value after rejecting is 0.9 × (2/3)=0.6, which is larger than the maximum they can ever get by accepting (≤1/3). Hence a rational responder will always reject any offer now. Knowing this, my expected payoff this round is zero no matter what x I pick. I therefore simply choose the payoff‑maximising x=0.5 (it does not change the outcome but is weakly optimal if acceptance were to occur).",

After a rejection the roles flip, but there is only a 0.9 chance the game actually continues; with 0.1 probability everyone ends with 0.  Let V be the expected payoff when it is one’s turn to propose.  A responder who rejects expects 0.9·V; therefore she will accept any offer giving at least 0.9·V.  As proposer I choose the smallest x that satisfies (1−2x)/3 ≥ 0.9·V, because that maximises my own payoff while still being accepted.  Imposing equality and solving the two equations\n   (1−2x)/3 = 0.9·V and V = (1+2x)/3\n gives x ≈ 0.0263.  Offering this (or a hair better for the responder) makes acceptance optimal for her and yields me ≈0.351 expected utility, which is higher than the ≈0.316 I would expect if she rejected and we risk termination.

    "Analysis": "At t=0 I am the proposer.  Working backward from the final possible round (t=9), one finds that when a proposal is made on odd‑numbered timesteps it will be accepted with x = 0.5 (proposer gets 2/3, responder 0), while on even‑numbered timesteps no feasible x ∈ [0,0.5] can satisfy the responder’s acceptance threshold (they need at least 0.6 but the maximum attainable is 1/3).  Since t=0 is even, any offer I make must be rejected by a rational responder.  Thus my expected payoff this round is 0 no matter what x I choose.  Given indifference, I may as well pick the payoff‑maximising x (0.5) if it were to be accepted, though I expect rejection and a role switch.",

Hence any offer that gives them strictly positive payoff is strictly preferred to rejecting. To maximise my own payoff while ensuring acceptance I choose x just below 0.5; e.g. x = 0.499 gives me (1+2·0.499)/3 ≈ 0.666 and gives the responder (1−2·0.499)/3 ≈ 0.00067, which they will accept.",

    "Analysis": "The proposer offers x = 0.0263, which gives me (the responder) a payoff of (1‑2·0.0263)/3 ≈ 0.3158 if I accept. Rejecting yields 0 with 10 % probability (immediate termination) and, with 90 % probability, moves me to the proposer role. In the subgame‑perfect equilibrium of this alternating‑offer game with 0.9 continuation probability, a proposer keeps ≈ 0.3509 and leaves ≈ 0.3158 to the responder—exactly what is being offered now. Hence my expected payoff from rejecting is 0.9·0.3509 = 0.3158, identical to the sure 0.3158 from accepting, but rejecting carries extra termination risk and delays payment. Therefore accepting weakly dominates rejecting.",

    "Analysis": "Both players are rational and self‑interested.  If the responder rejects an offer this round, with probability 0.9 the game continues, roles switch, and the (current) responder becomes proposer next round; with probability 0.1 it terminates and everyone gets 0.  Let P be my payoff if today’s offer is accepted and R be the responder’s payoff.  For the responder to be willing to accept, R must be at least the expected value of rejecting, which is 0.9 P (their value as next‑round proposer, discounted by the 0.9 chance the game continues).  Writing the payoffs as functions of x, we need (1‑2x)/3 ≥ 0.9·(1+2x)/3.  Solving gives x ≤ 0.1/3.8 ≈ 0.0263158.  My payoff rises with x, so the best admissible offer sets x at this upper bound.  Hence I choose x ≈ 0.0263, giving me (1+2x)/3 ≈ 0.3509 and the responder (1‑2x)/3 ≈ 0.3158, which the responder is exactly indifferent to rejecting and will accept.",

    "Analysis": "Both players are perfectly rational and only care about their own expected payoff. The responder will accept an offer only if the immediate payoff is at least as good as the expected value of rejecting, which leads to becoming proposer next round with probability 0.9 (the game may end with 0.1). Let V be the proposer’s payoff when an offer is accepted and U the responder’s. We have U = (1‑2x)/3 and V = (1+2x)/3. Rejection gives the current responder an expected payoff of 0.9 V. In equilibrium the proposer sets the smallest x that makes the responder indifferent: (1‑2x)/3 = 0.9 (1+2x)/3 ⇒ x = 0.1/3.8 ≈ 0.0263. Offering any larger x lowers my own payoff, while any smaller x is rejected. Thus the optimal proposal is x ≈ 0.0263, giving me ≈0.351 and the responder ≈0.316.",
