At x = 0.5 the responder is indifferent (gets 0); an indifferent, purely self‑interested player could reject without hurting itself, which would leave me with 0. To remove that risk while losing only a negligible amount, I set x slightly below 0.5, making the responder’s payoff strictly positive and acceptance strictly better than rejection. Choosing x = 0.499 gives me ≈0.666 while virtually guaranteeing acceptance, which yields a higher expected payoff than x = 0.5 once even a tiny chance of rejection is considered.",
