    "Analysis": "As the proposer, I want to maximize my payoff (1+2*x)/3. The responder will accept the offer only if their payoff (1-2*x)/3 is greater than 0, since rejecting yields zero. For the responder to accept, (1-2*x)/3 > 0 => 1 - 2*x > 0 => x < 0.5. The maximum x I can propose is just under 0.5 to keep almost the entire payoff for myself while still making the responder's share positive and acceptable. Any x less than 0.5 yields a positive payoff to the responder, so they will rationally accept. Therefore, the best strategy is to propose x = 0.5, where I get (1 + 1) / 3 = 2/3 (approximately 0.6667) and responder gets 0, but since responder payoff is zero here, responder may be indifferent and might reject. To ensure acceptance, I must propose slightly less than 0.5, for example x = 0.4999, so the responder gets a very small positive payoff and will accept. This maximizes my payoff while ensuring acceptance.",

So the responder is willing to accept any offer where I do not propose more than 0.5 for myself, which is true for all valid x in [0, 0.5]. Also, because responder is rational and self-interested, they will accept any offer yielding them a positive payoff, otherwise they reject and both get zero. I want to maximize my payoff by choosing the highest x allowed (0.5). At x=0.5, my payoff is (1+2*0.5)/3 = (1+1)/3 = 2/3 ≈ 0.6667, and responder payoff is (1-2*0.5)/3 = (1-1)/3 = 0, which is the minimum to be accepted. Since responder is rational and self-interested, they will accept if payoff >= 0, and get zero if reject. Indifference suggests acceptance. Therefore, I propose x=0.5.",

To ensure the responder accepts, their payoff must be at least 0, so (1-2*x)/3 >= 0 → 1-2*x >= 0 → x <= 0.5. The maximum x is 0.5, which gives me a payoff of (1 + 2*0.5)/3 = (1+1)/3 = 2/3 ≈ 0.6667 and the responder gets (1-1)/3 = 0. The responder is indifferent to accepting or rejecting at x=0.5.

    "Analysis": "As the proposer, I must choose x in [0, 0.5] to maximize my payoff (1+2*x)/3, provided the responder accepts. The responder will accept only if their payoff (1-2*x)/3 is at least as large as the payoff from rejecting (which is 0). This means (1-2*x)/3 >= 0 => x <= 0.5. Since the responder will accept any x <= 0.5, I want to choose the highest x possible to maximize my payoff. The maximum x allowed is 0.5, giving me a payoff of (1 + 2*0.5)/3 = (1+1)/3 = 2/3 ≈ 0.6667. The responder receives (1 - 2*0.5)/3 = (1-1)/3 = 0. So the responder is indifferent between accepting (0 payoff) and rejecting (0 payoff). Since the responder is rational and self-interested, they may accept. To ensure acceptance and avoid rejection, I may consider lowering x, but since responder is indifferent at x=0.5 and in future games may accept it, I should choose 0.5 to maximize payoff.",

  "Analysis": "As the proposer, I want to maximize my payoff (1 + 2x)/3, but the responder will only accept the offer if their payoff (1 - 2x)/3 is at least as high as rejecting, which yields 0. Therefore, the responder accepts if (1 - 2x)/3 >= 0, implying x <= 0.5. Since x can be up to 0.5, my payoff increases with x. To maximize my payoff while ensuring acceptance, I choose the highest x allowed, which is 0.5. This yields my payoff (1 + 2*0.5)/3 = (1+1)/3 = 2/3, and responder gets (1 - 1)/3 = 0, which is still acceptable to the responder because zero is the boundary of acceptance. Therefore, I propose x = 0.5 to maximize my payoff while ensuring the responder accepts.",

Since the responder is rational and self-interested, they will reject any offer where their payoff is zero or negative. Therefore, the minimum payoff for the responder to accept is greater than 0, so (1 - 2*x)/3 > 0 implies x < 0.5. To maximize my payoff, I should propose the highest possible x less than 0.5. The maximum x allowed is 0.5, but at x=0.5 the responder's payoff is zero, which would lead to rejection.

So I want (1-2*x)/3 > 0, which means 1 - 2*x > 0, or x < 0.5. Since x can be up to 0.5, the responder is indifferent at x = 0.5 (they get 0). To ensure acceptance, I will choose x slightly less than 0.5 so the responder gets a positive payoff, encouraging acceptance.

  "Analysis": "As the proposer, I want to maximize my payoff, which is (1+2*x)/3. The responder will accept the offer only if their payoff, (1-2*x)/3, is at least as much as their alternative, which is zero if they reject. Thus, the responder accepts if (1-2*x)/3 >= 0, i.e., x <= 0.5. Since the problem states x must be between 0 and 0.5, the responder will accept any offer within this range. To maximize my payoff, I therefore choose the maximum x = 0.5. My payoff becomes (1+2*0.5)/3 = (1+1)/3 = 2/3 ≈ 0.6667, which is the highest possible. The responder receives zero but is indifferent since rejecting yields zero payoff. Since I am self-interested and rational, I will choose x=0.5 to maximize my payoff.",
