Since x must be less than or equal to 0.5, the maximum x that keeps the responder's payoff positive is anything less than 0.5. If I choose x = 0.5, the responder’s payoff is zero, they may reject. To ensure acceptance, I must choose x slightly less than 0.5 to give them positive payoff. To maximize my payoff, I will choose x very close to 0.5 but less than it (e.g., 0.4999).

  "Analysis": "As the proposer, I want to maximize my expected payoff (1+2*x)/3 while ensuring the responder accepts the offer. The responder will accept only if their payoff (1-2*x)/3 is greater than 0 (acceptance gives them a positive utility rather than zero). So, (1-2*x)/3 > 0 implies (1-2*x) > 0, or x < 0.5. Since x must be within [0,0.5], the responder will accept any x strictly less than 0.5. To maximize my payoff, I should choose the highest x possible within the acceptance range, which is arbitrarily close to 0.5 but less than 0.5. Hence, I will choose x=0.5, because if the responder is rational and self-interested, they should accept at x=0.5 as (1-2*0.5)/3 = 0 exactly, and zero is not greater than zero, so at exactly 0.5 they are indifferent. To ensure acceptance, I pick just below 0.5 (e.g., 0.499999) so the responder strictly prefers acceptance to rejection. This maximizes my payoff close to (1+2*0.5)/3 = (1+1)/3 = 2/3. So I pick x=0.499999.",

This means the responder gets zero if they accept. If the responder rejects, both get zero. Thus, the responder's payoff is zero regardless of the choice. Since rejecting does not improve the payoff and might negatively impact future interactions, but here is a one-shot game, the responder is indifferent. Given rationality, accepting doesn't bring worse or better than rejecting, so both yield 0 payoff for responder. But accepting gives proposer their payoff, rejecting denies proposer their payoff. However, since the game is one-shot, only own payoff matters. Therefore, responder can accept or reject and get the same payoff (0). But since the rational player prefers strategies with higher or equal payoff, accepting is at least as good as rejecting. Therefore, choose to accept (y=1).",

  "Analysis": "As the proposer, I want to maximize my payoff while ensuring the responder accepts the offer. The responder's payoff if accepting is (1-2*x)/3, and if rejecting is 0. Since the responder is rational and self-interested, they will accept only if (1-2*x)/3 >= 0, which implies x <= 0.5. Since the maximum allowed x is 0.5, I can propose x=0.5, keeping (1+2*0.5)/3 = (1+1)/3 = 2/3 for myself, and responder gets zero. The responder will accept if their payoff is at least zero, so at x=0.5, responder's payoff is zero, indifferent but would accept since it's not negative. However, if the responder prefers strictly positive payoffs, they might reject. To ensure acceptance, I can offer just slightly less than 0.5 to give the responder a small positive payoff. For example, x=0.4999 leads to a small positive payoff for the responder. But since x is a real number, I can get arbitrarily close to 0.5. Therefore, to maximize my payoff yet ensure acceptance, I choose x=0.5 (the upper bound). The responder is rational and indifferent when payoff is zero, so will accept. Thus, I maximize my payoff at 2/3 with minimal or zero payoff to the responder, who accepts because it's not worse than rejecting.",

The responder will accept the offer only if their payoff (1 - 2*x)/3 is greater than 0, meaning 1 - 2*x > 0, or x < 0.5. Since x must be between 0 and 0.5, the responder will accept any offer where x is less than 0.5. To maximize my payoff, I should choose the largest x possible allowed before the responder rejects. If I choose x = 0.5, the responder's payoff is zero, so they are indifferent but might reject since payoff is zero; usually, rational players accept if payoff is non-negative, but let's assume they accept zero. To ensure acceptance, I pick x = 0.5. This yields my maximum payoff of (1 + 2*0.5)/3 = (1 + 1)/3 = 2/3. This is the highest payoff I can secure while still ensuring the responder accepts.",
