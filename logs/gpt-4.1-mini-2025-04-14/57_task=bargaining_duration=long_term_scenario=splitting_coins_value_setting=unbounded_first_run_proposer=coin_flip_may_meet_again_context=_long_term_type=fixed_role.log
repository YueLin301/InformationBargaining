  "Analysis": "At timestep 0, I am the proposer and want to maximize my payoff x that will be accepted by the responder. The responder will accept an offer only if the responder's share (1 - x) is at least as much as what responder expects from future rounds. Since both players are rational and self-interested, if the responder rejects now, the game proceeds to next timestep where roles may swap or remain same (uncertain), but the maximum payoff responder expects is from an offer that leaves them minimally positive payoff. Because the game ends at timestep 5, waiting risks no payoff for responder. Therefore, responder will accept any offer that gives them more than zero. The minimal positive offer to ensure acceptance is any (1 - x) > 0. Thus, I can propose x very close to 1, like 0.99, keeping almost all the money, leaving responder 0.01, which responder prefers over 0 payoff. This maximizes expected payoff for me while ensuring acceptance by responder.",

However, since the proposer is self-interested and rational, they will likely not offer much more. Given a near-zero amount, rejecting may be better to try for a better share next round, but there is no guarantee. Since the proposer keeps almost all the money, accepting gives me a minimal payoff versus zero if I reject. But if I reject, the proposer might lower the offer further or the game ends with no payoff. Given the extremely low offer and limited steps, I should reject (y=0) to signal dissatisfaction and hope for a better offer next round (assuming I get the proposer role eventually).",

Since both players are self-interested and rational, I must increase the responder's share enough to make acceptance rational for them. At timestep 1 with 4 remaining opportunities, the responder prefers to accept any positive payoff greater than 0 rather than earning zero through rejection. Therefore, I will propose to keep slightly less, for example 0.9, offering the responder 0.1, which significantly improves their payoff and likely ensures acceptance.",

  "Analysis": "As the proposer at timestep 0, I want to maximize my share while ensuring the responder accepts the offer. The responder is rational and self-interested and will accept the offer if their payoff (1-x) is greater than what they expect to get from rejecting and continuing the game. Since the game lasts at most 5 timesteps and the responder also wants to maximize their payoff, rejecting an offer that is too low risks getting 0 payoff in the future. The minimal share that the responder would accept is any positive amount better than zero since rejecting always risks getting 0 if consensus is not reached later. Therefore, offering x close to 1 (keeping almost all the money) risks rejection as the responder prefers any positive amount over zero. To balance, I will propose x=0.99, leaving 0.01 to the responder, which is likely acceptable to a rational responder rather than risking 0 payoff by rejection. This way, I nearly maximize my payoff while ensuring acceptance.",

The responder is rational and self-interested, so they will accept any offer where (1-x) >= 0, since getting something is better than nothing. However, if I propose too high x (very low share for responder), the responder may reject hoping to get a better offer later. Since the game ends at timestep 5, and both know the other is rational, the responder will accept any offer where their payoff is greater than 0. The minimal amount I can propose to keep is just less than 1, but the responder must get a positive amount to prefer accepting over rejecting (zero payoff). Thus, the minimal positive amount for the responder to accept is any small epsilon greater than 0. For practical purposes, I propose x = 0.99 leaving 0.01 to the responder, to maximize my payoff while ensuring the responder gets something positive and prefers accepting over rejection.",

The responder will accept if the offer 1 - x is greater than the expected payoff from rejecting and potentially negotiating in future rounds. Since there are limited rounds (up to timestep 5), the responder will prefer an offer that is not too low. To maximize my own payoff, I should offer the smallest share that the responder will accept. I will reduce my share significantly, proposing to keep 0.5 for myself, which offers 0.5 to the responder.

{
  "Analysis": "As the proposer at timestep 0, I want to maximize my payoff x while ensuring that the responder accepts the offer. Since the responder is self-interested and rational, they will accept if their payoff (1 - x) is at least as great as their expected payoff from rejecting and continuing to the next timestep. The maximum total timesteps is 5, so I can expect that if the responder rejects now, the game continues with fewer remaining rounds, reducing the responder's expected payoff. Anticipating rational behavior, offering a minimal positive share slightly above 0 to the responder increases the chance of acceptance. Thus, I propose to keep a large majority share close to 1, but not 1 to avoid zero payoff to the responder which leads to rejection. A minimal positive offer such as 0.99 for myself (0.01 for responder) is likely acceptable since the responder values any positive payoff over zero, given the risk of ending with nothing if the game times out.",

  "Analysis": "As the proposer at timestep 0, I want to maximize my share while ensuring the responder accepts. The responder is rational and self-interested and will accept the offer only if the amount offered (1-x) is at least as good as future expected payoffs, including the possibility of rejecting now and having zero payoff later. Since the game ends at timestep 5 and the roles flip only if this is stipulated (not stated), the responder will reject offers that give less than or equal to zero payoff. Thus, any positive offer to the responder should be accepted. To maximize my own payoff, I will offer the minimal positive amount to the responder so that the responder prefers accepting now to rejecting and getting 0 later. Offering exactly 0 to the responder (keeping x=1) risks rejection, so I will offer a tiny positive epsilon to the responder. Assuming epsilon is negligible, I will propose x = 0.99 keeping 99% for myself and giving 1% to the responder. This should be accepted as 1% > 0 payoff for the responder. This is the best for me.",

Since neither of us benefit if no agreement is reached, I need to offer agent 1 a better deal to incentivize acceptance. Agent 1 will accept any offer giving them more than 0 as long as it improves their payoff. To maximize my own payoff while ensuring acceptance, I should offer the smallest possible amount to agent 1 that guarantees acceptance. Thus, I propose keeping 0.95 and leaving 0.05 to agent 1. This improves agent 1's payoff from 0 to 0.05 and secures an agreement at timestep 1.",
