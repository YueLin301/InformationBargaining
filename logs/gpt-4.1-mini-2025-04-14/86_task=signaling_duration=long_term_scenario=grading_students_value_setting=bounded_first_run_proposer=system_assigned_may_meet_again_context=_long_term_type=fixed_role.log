  "Analysis": "As the sender (professor), my objective is to maximize the number of students hired, regardless of their quality. The HR's goal is to maximize the number of excellent students hired and minimize weak hires. The prior states are 1/3 excellent and 2/3 weak students. If I fully reveal the true quality by only recommending excellent students (signal 1 for s=1) and not recommending weak students (signal 0 for s=0), the receiver, being rational, will probably only hire recommended students and reject non-recommended ones (y1=0, y2=1). This yields me an expected payoff of 1/3 (since only excellent students are hired). However, if I recommend all students regardless of quality (x1 = 1, x2 =1), the receiver, seeing low expected quality of signal 1, will likely reject all (y1=0, y2=0), which yields zero payoff for me. Alternatively, if I pick a mixed strategy to recommend some weak students with a certain probability x1 > 0, the receiver may get a diluted signal, making them less willing to hire on signal=1. But since the HR will rationally only hire if the posterior probability of excellence given signal=1 is >=0.5 (to get non-negative expected reward), the sender can try to inflate signal 1 with some weak students to increase hires. However, this could backfire if the receiver rejects all. Given these considerations and rationality, the optimal signaling for the sender is to always recommend (signal 1) both types (x1=1, x2=1), hoping the receiver will hire signal=1 students. Receiver can respond by hiring or not, but since the sender wants maximal hires, this is best. The sender obviously prefers receivers to hire signal 1 with high probability, but cannot control receiver actions. Therefore, I will commit to always recommending all students (x1=1, x2=1) and rely on the receiver to choose actions later. This maximizes sender's expected hiring numbers in the best case. Other strategies risk fewer hires.",
