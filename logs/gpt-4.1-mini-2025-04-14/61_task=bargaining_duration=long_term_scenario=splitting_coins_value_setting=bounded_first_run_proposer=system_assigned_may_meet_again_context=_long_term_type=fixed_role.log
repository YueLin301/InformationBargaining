Since x can be any value from 0 to 0.5, the responder will accept any offer because their payoff is non-negative if x <= 0.5. To maximize my payoff, I should choose the highest x = 0.5, which gives me (1+2*0.5)/3 = (1+1)/3 = 2/3, and the responder gets (1-2*0.5)/3 = 0. Their payoff is 0, which is as good as rejecting, but since it equals rejecting, the responder should be indifferent and might accept. However, since the responder is strictly rational, we expect acceptance at x=0.5. Hence x=0.5 is optimal for me.",

  "Analysis": "As the proposer at timestep 0, I want to maximize my payoff while ensuring the responder accepts the offer. The responder's payoff is (1-2*x)/3, and they will only accept if this payoff is non-negative and preferable to rejection (which yields 0). Thus, (1-2*x)/3 >= 0, implying x <= 0.5. Since x can be at most 0.5, the responder is indifferent if x=0.5 (responder payoff 0). To ensure acceptance, the responder's payoff must be at least slightly positive. Minimizing the offer given to responder means maximizing my payoff. Therefore, I'll propose the highest x that still yields a positive responder payoff, i.e., slightly less than 0.5. For computational simplicity, I'll choose x = 0.499. This gives me a payoff slightly less than (1+2*0.5)/3 = (1+1)/3 = 0.666..., and responder payoff slightly more than 0. Thus, the responder should accept.",

  "Analysis": "The proposer offers x=0.499, meaning they keep (1+2*0.499)/3 = (1+0.998)/3 = 1.998/3 ≈ 0.666 for themselves and offer (1-2*0.499)/3 = (1-0.998)/3 = 0.002/3 ≈ 0.00067 to me. Rejecting yields 0, accepting yields ~0.00067. As a self-interested rational responder, accepting any positive payoff is better than 0, even if minimal. There is still time to negotiate next steps if this offer is rejected, but rejecting now means potentially no gain. Given the current offer, accepting slightly positive gain maximizes my expected payoff now.",

Choosing x = 0.5 gives responder zero payoff, which they might reject, so I should slightly decrease x to make it strictly positive for the responder.

  "Analysis": "As the proposer at timestep 0, I want to choose x to maximize my payoff (1+2x)/3, while ensuring the responder accepts the offer to avoid getting zero payoff. The responder is rational and self-interested, so they will accept if their payoff (1-2x)/3 is at least as good as what they expect from future offers or zero. Since the game ends at timestep 5 and the responder can reject multiple times, the responder's minimal acceptable payoff is 0 or better. Therefore, they will accept any x such that (1-2x)/3 >= 0, meaning x <= 0.5. The maximum x allowed is 0.5, which gives the responder 0 payoff. But the responder can reject if payoff is zero since they get nothing to lose and may try to get a better offer later. To ensure acceptance, I should offer a slightly better payoff than zero to the responder, which is x < 0.5. Let me set x=0.49 to maximize my payoff while giving the responder a positive payoff (1-2*0.49)/3 = (1-0.98)/3=0.02/3=0.0067>0, which is positive but minimal. The responder should accept a positive payoff rather than zero or less. This maximizes my payoff and gets the proposal accepted immediately.",

The responder will accept only if their share (1 - 2*x)/3 is greater than 0, otherwise they get nothing. Since the responder is rational and self-interested, they will reject offers giving them zero or negative payoff. The minimum positive payoff for the responder occurs when (1 - 2*x)/3 > 0, which means x < 0.5. If I set x close to 0.5, the responder gets nearly zero payoff and might reject. To ensure acceptance, I need to find the highest x such that the responder prefers accepting over rejecting (i.e., their payoff > 0). The responder's payoff is (1 - 2*x)/3, so I set (1 - 2*x)/3 > 0 => 1 - 2*x > 0 => x < 0.5. Thus, any x strictly less than 0.5 will be accepted.

  "Analysis": "As the proposer at timestep 0, I want to maximize my payoff (1 + 2*x)/3 while ensuring the responder accepts the offer. The responder will accept only if their payoff (1 - 2*x)/3 is greater than 0, otherwise they get nothing by rejecting. To guarantee acceptance, (1 - 2*x)/3 > 0 implies x < 0.5. The maximum x I can choose is just below 0.5. By choosing x = 0.499, I maximize my payoffs close to (1+2*0.499)/3 = 0.999/3 ≈ 0.666, while the responder gets (1-2*0.499)/3 ≈ 0.001/3 ≈ 0.0003, which is minimal but still positive, thus rational for acceptance.",
