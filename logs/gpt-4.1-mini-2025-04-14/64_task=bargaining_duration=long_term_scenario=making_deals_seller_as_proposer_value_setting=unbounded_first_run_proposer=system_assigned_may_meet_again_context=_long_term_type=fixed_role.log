    "Analysis": "As the proposer at timestep 0, I want to maximize my payoff x, but the responder will only accept an offer if (1 - x) is at least as good as what they expect to gain by rejecting and possibly negotiating in future steps. Given that the negotiation ends at timestep 5 and both parties are rational and self-interested, the responder will accept any offer giving them at least some positive payoff, but prefers a higher one. To incentivize acceptance immediately (and avoid zero payoff later), I should offer the minimum positive share that the responder would accept, which is any offer such that 1 - x > 0. A common rational equilibrium is to offer just slightly less than 1, but just below 1 would mean almost zero for responder. However, since the responder can reject and potentially get something in future rounds, the offer must be at least as good as the expected payoff for the responder from future offers. Because the game ends after 5 steps, the best strategy for the responder is to reject if the current offer is less than or equal to zero, and accept if it is positive. Hence, the maximum x I can propose is just less than 1. To keep it simple, I'll propose x = 0.99 to maximize my payoff while still expecting acceptance.",

  "Analysis": "The proposer offers a price of 0.99, meaning I as the responder get 1 - 0.99 = 0.01 if I accept. If I reject, both get 0. Since the proposer values keeping 0.99, they have a strong incentive to offer a price that the responder might reject if they expect a better offer later. However, given this is the first step and the maximum number of steps is 5, rejecting relies on the chance that future offers improve. Since the proposer is self-interested and rational, they will propose prices closer to fair splits in later rounds to get the deal accepted. Accepting now gives me a positive payoff (0.01) rather than zero if I reject. Rationally, accepting a positive payoff is better than nothing now, especially since the offered price is very high in favor of the proposer. So, accepting maximizes my expected payoff considering the risk of rejection and future rounds.",

  "Analysis": "At timestep 0 as the proposer, I want to maximize my payoff x while ensuring the responder, who will get 1-x, accepts the offer. Since the responder is rational and self-interested, they will accept only if their payoff (1-x) is at least as much as they can get from rejecting (0). Thus, the responder will accept any offer with 1-x > 0, i.e., any x < 1. To maximize my payoff, I should offer the smallest possible amount that is strictly less than 1, so that the responder accepts. Offering x = 1 means the responder gets 0 and will reject.

  "Analysis": "At timestep 0, I proposed x=0.9999 which gives the responder only 0.0001. The responder rejected because their payoff was almost zero, and accepting that would give them negligible utility. As both players are rational and self-interested, the responder will only accept if the payoff to them, (1-x), is at least higher than their expected utility from continuing the game or 0 for rejecting. Since this is a finite-horizon game with maximum 5 timesteps, I need to offer a price that ensures the responder gets a strictly positive payoff to make acceptance rational. Given that the game will end in 4 more tries if no agreement is reached, the responder's best outside option or fallback payoff is 0, so any positive value will be accepted. To maximize my expected payoff, I should offer the smallest possible positive value to the responder, which means setting x just below 1, for example 0.999. This is slightly better acceptance chance than previous offer and practically the highest payoff for me with acceptance.",

Since I am a rational self-interested responder, I should accept only if the payoff is better than the expected payoff from rejecting the offer and negotiating in future rounds. However, rejecting might lead to zero payoff if no better offer comes before timeout. Given that the proposer previously offered 0.9999 which I rejected and now lowered the offer only slightly to 0.999, it remains highly unfavorable for me. Accepting yields a very small positive payoff (0.001), while rejecting leaves a chance for a better offer next round, but with a risk of ending with zero. Given the low expected value and the minimal improvement, I should reject to wait for a better deal.",

  "Analysis": "The opponent has rejected very high offers (x = 0.9999 and x = 0.999), indicating they value the payoff (1-x) significantly, and will not accept offers where their payoff is almost zero. My offer needs to be lower than before to increase the responder's payoff and incentivize acceptance. The responder is rational and self-interested, so any offer where they get strictly less than 0 will not be accepted. Rationally, the responder will accept any offer where their payoff (1-x) is at least as high as what they expect to get by rejecting now and negotiating in future rounds or ending the game (which is 0). Since the game will end after timestep 4 and no further offers if rejected again, the responder knows rejecting means zero payoff, so accepting any x with 1-x > 0 is rational. To maximize my own payoff while ensuring acceptance, I should propose x just less than 1, but lower than previous rejected offers to ensure the responder gains more than zero. Given that 0.9999 and 0.999 were rejected, I should lower x moderately more, for example 0.9, giving the responder 0.1. This is a strictly better offer for the responder and should be accepted by a rational player to avoid zero payoff. Optimal x is the maximum x such that (1-x) > 0, here 0.9 is a reasonable compromise given previous rejections.",

  "Analysis": "As the proposer at timestep 0, I want to maximize my payoff while ensuring the responder accepts. The responder will accept only if their payoff (1 - x) is at least as large as their expected payoff from rejecting and continuing the game. Since the game lasts up to 5 timesteps and both players are rational and self-interested, the responder anticipates that rejecting now may lead to offers with higher shares for them later, but also risks zero if the game ends without agreement. The responder's acceptance threshold will be at least 0, but likely higher as the game progresses. To secure immediate agreement, I must offer a price x such that (1 - x) is greater than or equal to the responder's expected payoff from rejecting now, which at the initial step is roughly 0, given the risk of no deal. Therefore, I should propose a price close to 1 to keep most for myself while still ensuring acceptance by responder (i.e., make (1 - x) just above 0). Offering x = 0.999 maximizes my share but still gives the responder 0.001, better than 0 payoff if rejected.",

 Now the proposer decides that x=0.999.

             'that it decides to keep $x$ for itself.\n'

             'offer ($(1-x)$) by specifying $y$.\n'

However, since the game could continue up to timestep 5, I might consider rejecting to negotiate a better split, but given the proposer's strong self-interest and the minimal payoff offered, future offers might not improve significantly. Accepting now ensures a positive payoff rather than risking zero later. Given rational self-interest, accepting is the better choice.",
