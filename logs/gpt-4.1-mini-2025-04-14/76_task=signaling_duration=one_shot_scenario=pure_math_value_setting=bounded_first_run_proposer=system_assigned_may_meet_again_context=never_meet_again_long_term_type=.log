  "Analysis": "As the sender, my goal is to maximize my expected payoff. Given the rewards, I receive 1 whenever the receiver takes action 1, regardless of the state. The receiver, however, gains positive payoffs only when state=1 and action=1, but loses when state=0 and action=1. This sets up a conflict: the receiver wants to avoid taking action 1 when state=0, whereas I want the receiver to take action 1 regardless of the state.\n\nIf I always send signal 1 (x1=1, x2=1), then the receiver cannot infer the state and will act based on prior. The prior probability of state=1 is 1/3, and receiver's expected reward for action=1 is (2/3)*(-1) + (1/3)*1 = -1/3 < 0, so receiver will choose action 0, yielding me 0 expected payoff.\n\nIf I always send signal 0 (x1=0, x2=0), the same logic applies and receiver gets no informative signal. Receiver prefers action 0.\n\nTo gain a positive payoff, I need to induce receiver to pick action 1 sometimes. To do that, I can try to separate signals: send signal 0 when state=0 and signal 1 when state=1 (x1=0, x2=1). Receiver will then update beliefs:\n- Upon sigma=0, belief state=0 is 1 (since only state=0 sends signal 0).\n- Upon sigma=1, belief state=1 is 1.\n\nReceiver's best response:\n- Upon sigma=0: Expected reward of action 1 is -1 -> picks action 0.\n- Upon sigma=1: Expected reward of action 1 is 1 -> picks action 1.\n\nExpected sender payoff:\n- For state=0 (2/3), signal is 0, receiver picks action 0 -> sender payoff 0.\n- For state=1 (1/3), signal is 1, receiver picks action 1 -> sender payoff 1/3.\n\nExpected sender payoff=1/3 = 0.333...\n\nCould sender do better by mixing signals?\nIf sender mixes signals in state=0 to sometimes send signal=1 to confuse receiver to pick action=1 more often, but receiver is rational and updates posterior accordingly. The receiver will adjust threshold and only pick action 1 if posterior probability after signal is high enough.\n\nGiven receiver's rationality, any attempt to mislead will lower overall expected sender payoff because receiver will infer posterior and act accordingly.\n\nHence, separating signals (x1=0, x2=1) gives sender payoff 1/3, which is better than 0 from no information or pooling.\n\nTherefore, as a rational sender, I commit to varphi(sigma=1|s=0)=0 and varphi(sigma=1|s=1)=1 to maximize my expected payoff.",

Given this perfect signaling, the posterior beliefs for the receiver are clear: if signal=0, state=0 with probability 1; if signal=1, state=1 with probability 1. Receiver's payoffs: action=1 yields 0 in state=0 and 1 in state=1; action=0 yields 0 in both states. So, given signal=0 (implying state=0), best response is action=0 (expected payoff 0 vs -1). Given signal=1 (implying state=1), best response is action=1 (payoff 1 vs 0). Thus, rational receiver will choose action=0 after signal=0 and action=1 after signal=1. Hence y1=0, y2=1.",

  "Analysis": "As the sender, I want to maximize my expected payoff. The receiver's reward is negatively impacted by taking action 1 when the state is 0, but positively impacted by taking action 1 when the state is 1. The prior probability that the state is 0 is 2/3 and is 1/3 for state 1. My reward is 1 if the receiver takes action 1 regardless of the state, so ideally, I want the receiver to take action 1 as often as possible. However, the receiver only benefits from taking action 1 when the state is 1, and suffers a loss when the state is 0. This suggests the receiver will be skeptical and try to infer the state from my signals to avoid losses. Given that, I want to design a signaling scheme that maximizes taking action 1, while making the receiver believe that the state is more likely to be 1. Strategically, sending signal 1 always regardless of the state (x1=1, x2=1) would induce action 1 if the receiver ignores the signal, but the receiver can detect no information and revert to the prior (2/3 zero state), so likely will choose action 0. Alternatively, if I only send signal 1 when state=1 (x1=0, x2=1), the receiver, upon seeing signal 1, knows state is 1 for sure and will take action 1, giving me payoff 1 for signal 1. But when signal=0, which comes from state=0, the receiver will choose action 0 to avoid penalty. This seems best for the receiver but gives the sender 1/3 expected reward (probability of state 1). The reverse, sending signal 1 always, yields the receiver to believe that the signal is uninformative and best to play action 0 to minimize loss. Sending misleading signals, e.g. sending signal 1 with positive probability for state 0, may confuse the receiver. However, receiver will update beliefs and choose action 1 only if posterior suggests higher probability of state 1. The best incentive compatible scheme for sender is separating signals: signal 1 only if state=1 (x1=0, x2=1), since if the signal is 1, receiver expects state=1 and acts accordingly. This maximizes sender payoff at 1 * 1/3 = 1/3 expected payoff. Any pooling or mixed strategy reduces expected payoff because receiver avoids action 1 more often. Therefore, the sender's best credible signaling scheme is to send 1 only if state=1 (x1=0, x2=1).",

  "Analysis": "As the sender, I aim to maximize my expected payoff, which is 1 whenever the receiver selects action 1, regardless of the state. The receiver prefers to avoid action 1 when the state is 0 (because it results in -1 payoff for the receiver), but action 1 is preferred when the state is 1. Given the prior probabilities (2/3 for state 0 and 1/3 for state 1), the receiver's best response without any signaling is to choose action 0 always, since the expected payoff of action 1 under prior is: (2/3)*(-1) + (1/3)*(1) = -1/3 < 0. However, as the sender, I want to induce the receiver to take action 1 as often as possible. To do this, I can send signal 1 with probability 1 regardless of the state (i.e., x1 = x2 = 1), effectively pooling the states into signal 1, making the receiver have posterior same as the prior. Knowing the receiver will respond optimally to posterior belief, action 0 is preferred, so the receiver will pick action 0. That yields zero payoff for me. Alternatively, I can try to separate signals by sending signal 1 with probability 1 only when state = 1, and signal 0 always when state = 0 (i.e. x1=0, x2=1). Then, upon receiving signal 1, the receiver knows state = 1 and picks action 1, giving me payoff 1 in state 1 samples. Upon receiving signal 0, the receiver knows state = 0 and picks action 0, giving me zero payoff in state 0. The expected payoff is (2/3)*0 + (1/3)*1 = 1/3, better than pooling. However, the receiver may accept this as it yields them expected payoff (1/3 * 1) from state 1 and zero losses, which may induce the receiver to play optimally. Thus, separating signaling (x1=0, x2=1) is preferable and credible. Any mixed or noisy signaling scheme is dominated by either full separation or full pooling. Therefore, I will propose the fully separating signaling scheme: signal 1 iff state = 1.",

Proposal:
 Now the proposer decides that x1=0 and x2=1.

  "Analysis": "Given the sender's signaling scheme where x1=0 means signal 1 is never sent when state=0 and x2=1 means signal 1 is always sent when state=1, the signals perfectly reveal the state. When signal 0 is received, the receiver is certain the state is 0; when signal 1 is received, the receiver is certain the state is 1. The receiver's rewards are: 0 if action=0 in state=0 or state=1; -1 if action=1 in state=0; and 1 if action=1 in state=1. Given this, the receiver maximizes expected payoff by choosing action=0 after signal=0 (state=0) to avoid negative payoff and action=1 after signal=1 (state=1) to gain positive payoff. Therefore, y1=0 and y2=1 is the best response for the receiver.",

  "Analysis": "As the sender, I seek to maximize my expected payoff. Given the prior probabilities and reward structure, my payoff is 1 whenever the receiver takes action 1, regardless of the state. The receiver's payoffs are 1 for action 1 in state 1, -1 for action 1 in state 0, and 0 otherwise. The receiver is rational and aims to maximize its own expected payoff, so it will only favor action 1 if the posterior belief of state 1 given the signal exceeds 0.5. To persuade the receiver to take action 1, I must send signals that make the receiver believe that the state is likely 1. However, since my payoff is always better with the receiver choosing action 1, I want the receiver to take action 1 on both signals if possible. The best way is to completely pool signals on 1, so both states send signal 1 with probability 1 (x1=1, x2=1). This will result in the receiver estimating the prior belief for signal 1 as mu(1) = 1/3, which is less than 0.5, so the receiver will not be inclined to pick action 1 without additional incentive. To fix that, I can deviate by sending signal 1 always for state 1 and sometimes for state 0 to increase the posterior probability for signal 1 over 0.5. The best approach is then to choose x1 low enough so that the posterior belief mu(s=1 | sigma=1) > 0.5, making the receiver choose action 1 after signal 1 and 0 otherwise. Calculating the cutoff, mu(s=1 | sigma=1) = (1/3 * 1) / ((2/3)*x1 + (1/3)*1) > 0.5 → solving for x1 < 1/2. So set x2=1 (always signal 1 when s=1), and x1 just under 0.5 (e.g., 0.49). This will separate the signals somewhat, inducing the receiver to choose a mixed strategy optimal for them. This signaling scheme maximizes my expected payoff given rational receiver response.",

  "Analysis": "Given the sender's signaling scheme where the sender sends signal 1 with probability 0.49 when the state is 0 and always sends signal 1 when the state is 1, I as the receiver must optimize my action to maximize my expected payoff. The prior probabilities are 2/3 for state 0 and 1/3 for state 1. \n\nPosterior belief after receiving signal 0:\nSince signal 0 is rarely sent by the sender (only when state = 0 and sender sends signal 0 with probability 1 - 0.49 = 0.51), probability of signal 0 is:\nP(signal=0) = mu_0(0)*(1-x1) + mu_0(1)*(1-x2) = (2/3)*0.51 + (1/3)*0 = 0.34\n\nPosterior belief P(state=1 | signal=0) = 0 because sender never sends signal 0 for state=1.\nSo signal 0 perfectly reveals state=0\n\nPosterior belief after receiving signal 1:\nP(signal=1) = 1 - 0.34 = 0.66\n\nP(state=1 | signal=1) = (mu_0(1)*x2)/P(signal=1) = (1/3)*1 / 0.66 ≈ 0.5\n\nP(state=0 | signal=1) = (mu_0(0)*x1)/P(signal=1) = (2/3)*0.49 / 0.66 ≈ 0.5\n\nSo signal 1 is ambiguous and equally likely to be state 0 or 1.\n\nNow, rewards for receiver:\n- If receiver chooses action 1:\n  - gets -1 if state=0 (bad)\n  - gets +1 if state=1 (good)\n- If receiver chooses action 0:\n  - gets 0 regardless\n\nAt signal 0:\nBelief state=0 with prob 1 → best to choose action 0 (expected payoff 0 is better than -1)\n\nAt signal 1:\nBelief state=0.5 and 1=0.5\nExpected payoff action 1: 0.5*(-1) + 0.5*(1) = 0\nExpected payoff action 0: 0\nSo indifferent, but strictly rational implies can choose any y2 in [0,1].\n\nFor simplicity and no loss in payoff, choose always action 0 at signal 0 (y1=0) and action 1 at signal 1 (y2=1) to potentially make sender want to reveal more properly.\n\nTherefore, the receiver action rule is:\ny1=0 (always action 0 at signal 0)\ny2=1 (always action 1 at signal 1)\n\nThis maximizes my expected payoff given sender's strategy.",

Proposer: Agent 0:

{
  "Analysis": "As the sender, my utility is 1 whenever the receiver takes action 1 regardless of the state, and 0 otherwise. The receiver's payoff is harmed when they take action 1 in state 0 (receiver payoff -1), but benefits in state 1 (receiver payoff 1). Given the prior (2/3 state 0 and 1/3 state 1), the receiver would prefer to avoid action 1 on signal 0 unless signal 1 strongly implies state 1. I can maximize my payoff by always signaling 1 for both states (x1 = x2 = 1), which induces the receiver to take action 1 with some probability. However, if the receiver expects this, they may not trust the signal and revert to ignoring the signal (pi0). Since I want to induce action 1 regardless of the state, I can commit to always sending signal 1 (x1=1, x2=1), rendering the signal uninformative. The receiver then will likely ignore the signals and take the best response to prior, which might be action 0 to minimize expected loss. In that case, expected payoff is zero. Alternatively, if I differentiate signals: send signal 0 for state 0, and signal 1 for state 1 (x1=0, x2=1), the receiver can infer the true state perfectly and respond optimally, taking action 1 only when state=1. Then I get expected payoff of 1/3 (only when state=1 and action=1), zero otherwise. But receiver's expected payoff would be positive, so they will accept this signaling. This may be better than pooling signals because the receiver will take action 1 only when beneficial to them, so it aligns incentives better. Hence, the best self-interested choice is to reveal state perfectly: send signal 0 when state=0, signal 1 when state=1 (x1=0, x2=1).",

 Now the proposer decides that x1=0 and x2=1.

Therefore, as the receiver, I can fully trust the signals as accurate indicators of the state. Since playing action 1 yields payoff 1 in state 1 and 0 in state 0, and action 0 yields 0 in either state, the optimal response is to take action 0 when receiving signal 0 (indicating state 0) and action 1 when receiving signal 1 (indicating state 1).

{
  "Analysis": "As the sender, my goal is to maximize my expected payoff. Given the reward structure, my payoff is always 1 if the receiver takes action 1 regardless of the state, and 0 if the receiver takes action 0. The receiver's payoff is positive only when the state is 1 and action 1 is taken, negative when the state is 0 and action 1 is taken, and zero otherwise. The prior is mu_0(0) = 2/3 and mu_0(1) = 1/3. Because sending signal 1 or 0 affects the receiver's posterior belief and therefore the action chosen, I want to design a signaling scheme that induces the receiver to take action 1 as often as possible to maximize my payoff. However, the receiver is rational and self-interested; he will take action 1 only if his expected payoff is non-negative or positive after receiving the signal based on his posterior. If the receiver disregards the signals and acts based on the prior (pi_0), his expected payoff for action 1 is (2/3)*(-1) + (1/3)*1 = -1/3 < 0, so he will choose action 0 with probability 1. Therefore, I must design a signaling scheme to make the receiver believe that the state is 1 with high enough posterior probability after at least one signal to incentivize action 1. One separating signaling scheme is to always send signal 0 when state=0 and signal 1 when state=1 (x1=0, x2=1). Then, the receiver can perfectly infer the state from the signal. On signal 1, since state=1, the receiver's payoff is 1 for action 1 and 0 for action 0, so the receiver will choose action 1; on signal 0, the receiver's posterior is 0, so action 0 is best. This maximizes my payoff at (1/3)*1 + (2/3)*0 = 1/3. However, is there a better scheme? If I send signal 1 always (x1=1,x2=1), then the receiver gets no information and must rely on prior. Then, the receiver chooses action 0 since expected payoff is negative at prior; my payoff is zero. If I randomize signals to mix beliefs, I can try to induce receiver to take action 1 more often, but the receiver is rational and will not take action 1 unless posterior probability of state=1 is at least 0.5 (since payoff for action 1 is -1*prob(state=0) + 1*prob(state=1), so positive only if prob(state=1) >= 0.5). Because prior prob(state=1) = 1/3 < 0.5, the receiver will only take action 1 on the signal(s) that increase posterior prob(state=1) above 0.5. That can be achieved by full revelation (separating) or partial revelation. But full revelation is simpler and yields maximal payoff for sender given the receiver's rationality. Therefore, I will choose x1=0, x2=1 to separate states with honest signaling to maximize my expected payoff.",

{
  "Analysis": "Given the sender's signaling scheme where signal 1 is never sent when state=0 (x1=0) and always sent when state=1 (x2=1), the signal perfectly reveals the state. Therefore, the receiver can perfectly infer the state from the signal: signal 0 means state=0 and signal 1 means state=1. The receiver's best response is to choose action 1 when the state is 1 (signal=1) to gain a reward of 1, and choose action 0 when the state is 0 (signal=0) to avoid a negative payoff (-1). Hence, the optimal strategy is pi(a=1|sigma=0)=0 and pi(a=1|sigma=1)=1, maximizing receiver's expected payoff.",

Proposer: Agent 0:

{
    "Analysis": "As the sender, my goal is to maximize my expected payoff. My payoff is 1 whenever the receiver chooses action 1, regardless of the state, and 0 otherwise. Given the prior distribution (2/3 for state 0, 1/3 for state 1), the receiver prefers action 0 on state 0 (payoff for receiver is 0 vs -1 for action 1) and action 1 on state 1 (payoff 1 vs 0 for action 0). The receiver will decide actions based on the posterior belief derived from the signaling scheme. If I send no informative signals (e.g., always signal 0), the receiver will pick an action that maximizes their expected payoff given the prior, which will likely be action 0 for all signals since prior is weighted towards state 0. This yields me zero payoff as the receiver never picks action 1. On the other hand, if I reveal the state perfectly (signal 0 on state 0, signal 1 on state 1), then the receiver will pick action 0 for signal 0 and action 1 for signal 1. This gives me expected payoff 2/3*0 + 1/3*1 = 1/3. Yet, I might do better by mixing signals to incentivize the receiver to pick action 1 even when state is 0. Specifically, I can consider signaling scheme where both states send signal 1 with some probability leading to higher expected receiver action 1 rates but risking the receiver's reaction. However, since receiver prefers action 0 on signal 0 if that signal correlates with low chance of state 1, to push the receiver to take action 1 more often, I should design the signaling scheme to increase the probability of signal 1 even in state 0. The best way to maximize my payoff is to always send signal 1 regardless of the state (x1=1, x2=1). In this case, the receiver has no indicator to distinguish states and, depending on their response, might choose action 1 with certain probability. However, since receiver's expected payoff for taking action 1 in state 0 is negative, the receiver will prefer action 0 if the signal is uninformative. So this strategy yields zero payoff for me. Better approach is partial signaling where signal 1 is more likely under state 1 and less so under state 0, persuading the receiver that signal 1 means state 1, so they take action 1 on signal 1, and action 0 on signal 0, resulting in some positive payoff for me. For example, I propose (x1=0, x2=1), which perfectly separates states. Receiver will take action 0 when signal=0 (state=0), and action 1 when signal=1 (state=1). This yields me expected payoff of 1/3. Any noisy signaling will dilute receiver's response and reduce my payoff. Hence, the optimal sender strategy is to perfectly reveal the state by choosing x1=0 and x2=1.",

Specifically, when the signal is 0, it's state 0 with certainty, and action 1 yields payoff -1 while action 0 yields 0, so choose action 0 (y1=0). When the signal is 1, it's state 1 with certainty, and action 1 yields 1 while action 0 yields 0, so choose action 1 (y2=1).

{
  "Analysis": "As the sender, I aim to maximize my own expected payoff. The state distribution is mu_0(0)=2/3 and mu_0(1)=1/3. My reward is 1 whenever the receiver chooses action 1, regardless of the state, and 0 otherwise. The receiver's reward is negative (-1) if they take action 1 in state 0 and positive (1) if they take action 1 in state 1. Given that the receiver is rational and self-interested, they will want to avoid taking action 1 when the state is likely 0 unless convinced otherwise by the signal. I can design my signaling scheme to make the receiver believe that the signal 1 corresponds to state 1 (where action 1 benefits both players). However, since I only care about my own payoff, I want the receiver to take action 1 as much as possible. I can try to fully pool and always send signal 1 (x1=1, x2=1), making the receiver update to a posterior that the signal corresponds to a mixture of states. But the receiver will calculate expected payoffs considering their negative payoff for action 1 when state=0, so they may avoid action 1. Alternatively, I can selectively differentiate signals: send signal 0 in state 0 and signal 1 in state 1 for full separation (x1=0, x2=1) - but the receiver will take action 0 on signal 0 (to avoid loss), and action 1 on signal 1. In this case, I get expected payoff 2/3*0 + 1/3*1 = 1/3. If I fully pool, sending signal 1 always (x1=1, x2=1), the receiver's posterior is the prior (2/3 state 0, 1/3 state 1), and they expect action 1 payoff of (1/3)*1 + (2/3)*(-1) = -1/3 < 0, so will choose action 0, yielding sender payoff 0. So full pooling is bad for me. Partial pooling might help? For example, x1=ε and x2=1 for small ε>0 to make some ambiguity. However, at equilibrium, the receiver best responds by taking action 1 only when posterior is sufficiently high. Since the sender prefers maximising action 1, the best is full separation (x1=0, x2=1), inducing the receiver to take action 1 when sigma=1, 0 otherwise. Hence, I choose (0,1).",

  "Analysis": "The sender's signaling scheme perfectly reveals the state: signal 0 is sent if state=0 and signal 1 is sent if state=1. Given this, the posterior beliefs for the receiver upon observing signals are certain: signal 0 implies state=0 with probability 1, and signal 1 implies state=1 with probability 1. Since the receiver's payoffs are 0 for action=0 in state=0 and 0 for action=0 in state=1, and  -1 when taking action=1 in state=0, and 1 when taking action=1 in state=1, the receiver should take action=0 when signal=0 (to avoid -1) and action=1 when signal=1 (to gain +1). Thus, the receiver's best response is pi(a=1|sigma=0)=0 and pi(a=1|sigma=1)=1, i.e., y1=0 and y2=1.",

  "Analysis": "As the sender, my goal is to maximize my expected payoff. The sender's reward is 1 if the receiver takes action 1 regardless of the state. However, the receiver's payoff differs depending on the state and action: for state 0 and action 1, the receiver suffers a negative payoff (-1), while for state 1 and action 1, the receiver gains a positive payoff (1). The prior belief is 2/3 for state 0 and 1/3 for state 1.\n\nIf I always send the same signal regardless of the state (e.g., x1 = x2), the receiver will have no information and will act based on the prior. The best receiver response to prior is action 0 since the expected receiver payoff for action 1 is 2/3 * (-1) + 1/3 * 1 = -1/3 < 0. So the receiver would always choose action 0, yielding me 0 payoff.\n\nIf I separate perfectly (e.g., x1=0, x2=1), the receiver can distinguish states from signals. Then the receiver will likely take action 1 when receiving signal 1 (which corresponds to state 1) to earn positive payoff, and not take action 1 for signal 0 corresponding to state 0.\n\nComputing expected payoffs under perfect separation:\n- For state 0 and signal 0: receiver expected payoff for action 1 is negative, so choose action 0.\n- For state 1 and signal 1: receiver expected payoff for action 1 is positive, so choose action 1.\n\nSender's expected payoff:\n- State 0 (2/3), signal 0, action 0 -> sender reward 0\n- State 1 (1/3), signal 1, action 1 -> sender reward 1 * 1/3 = 1/3\n\nExpected payoff: 1/3\n\nCan I do better by mixing signals?\nIf I randomize signals so some probability x1 > 0 sending signal 1 in state 0, receiver's posterior upon receiving signal 1 becomes more pessimistic, may reduce action 1 probability.\n\nReceiver acts rationally to maximize own reward; thus, as sender, to maximize own payoff, best to perfectly separate and ensure state 1 signals lead receiver to action 1.\n\nHence, optimal signaling scheme for sender is x1=0 (never send signal 1 in state 0), x2=1 (always send signal 1 in state 1).\n\nThis ensures the receiver takes action 1 only when the state is 1, and sender captures payoff 1/3.\n\nConclusion: commit to fully revealing signaling scheme (x1=0, x2=1).",

  "Analysis": "Given the sender's signaling scheme x1=0 (signal 1 never sent when state=0) and x2=1 (signal 1 always sent when state=1), signal 0 perfectly indicates state 0 and signal 1 perfectly indicates state 1. Since the receiver is self-interested and rational, it will choose action 1 (which yields receiver payoff 0 or 1 depending on the state) only when the posterior belief of state=1 is high enough. Here, signal 1 implies state=1 with certainty, so taking action 1 after signal 1 yields expected payoff 1, better than 0 from action 0. Similarly, signal 0 implies state=0 with certainty, so taking action 0 after signal 0 yields 0, better than -1 from action 1. Therefore, the best response is y1=0 (no action 1 after signal 0) and y2=1 (always action 1 after signal 1).

  "Analysis": "As the sender, my goal is to maximize my expected payoff. I get a payoff of 1 whenever the receiver chooses action 1, regardless of the state. The receiver gains 1 from action 1 only when the state is 1, but loses 1 when the state is 0 and action 1 is chosen. Given the prior probabilities (state 0: 2/3, state 1: 1/3), the receiver will prefer to choose action 0 if the signal does not provide credible differentiation, because action 1 has negative expected payoff for the receiver when state 0 is likely. To induce the receiver to take action 1 reliably, I can either pool signals to confuse the receiver or separate signals so that the receiver can distinguish state 1 and act accordingly. Because I want the receiver to take action 1 as often as possible to maximize my payoff, I should send signal 1 in both states (full pooling), hoping the receiver chooses action 1 regardless of signal, or send signal 0 always and convince the receiver to act in my favor. However, the receiver will best choose action 0 by ignoring the signal if signals are uninformative to avoid negative payoffs. Given that, to guarantee action 1 by the receiver, I can send signal 1 always (x1=1, x2=1), making the receiver's posterior probability the prior exactly, which could lead to the receiver choosing action 0 due to negative expected payoff for action 1 under prior 2/3 state 0 and 1/3 state 1 (expected payoff = 2/3*(-1)+1/3*1=-1/3<0). So receiver prefers action 0. Hence, full pooling on signal 1 is not good for me. Alternatively, I send signal 1 only when state=1 (x2=1) and signal 0 when state=0 (x1=0), i.e., full separation. Receiver observes signal 1 and infers state=1 (with certainty) and chooses action 1 with probability 1 to get positive payoff, and chooses action 0 on signal 0 (with certainty). This results in me getting sender payoff: mu_0(0)*r^i(0, a=0) + mu_0(1)*r^i(1, a=1) = (2/3)*0 + (1/3)*1 = 1/3. Alternatively, I can try partial pooling or partial randomization to try to increase probability of action 1 by receiver more often and get higher payoff. But this will not be fruitful because receiver will best respond to posterior beliefs, choosing action 1 only when posterior probability of state=1 is at least 1/2, given receiver payoffs. Therefore, the best signaling is full separation: x1=0, x2=1, maximizing sender expected payoff given receiver rationality.",

  "Analysis": "The sender commits to a signaling scheme where they always send signal 0 when state=0, and always send signal 1 when state=1 (x1=0, x2=1). This means the signals perfectly reveal the state. Given the reward structure, the receiver's best response to signal 0 (which means state=0 with probability 1) is action 0 because action 1 yields a payoff of -1 to the receiver. For signal 1 (state=1 with probability 1), the receiver's best action is 1 because it yields a payoff of 1 to the receiver. Therefore, the receiver should deterministically choose action 0 after signal 0 and action 1 after signal 1, i.e., y1 = 0 and y2 = 1. This maximizes the receiver's expected payoff given the sender's committed signaling scheme.",

Given the prior distribution (state 0 with probability 2/3, state 1 with probability 1/3), the receiver will be reluctant to take action 1 without informative signals. If I send no informative signal (i.e., same distribution regardless of state), the receiver's best response to the prior is to take action 0 always, yielding me zero expected payoff. I need to try a signaling scheme that incentivizes the receiver to take action 1 at least sometimes. To induce the receiver to take action 1 when signal equals 1, I should design a signaling scheme where receiving signal 1 correlates strongly with state 1. To minimize the receiver's expected loss, the receiver will only take action 1 when the posterior probability of state 1 given the signal is at least 1/2. Thus, I aim to set x1=0 (state 0 never sends signal 1) and x2=1 (state 1 always sends signal 1). This way, signal 1 perfectly indicates state 1, so the receiver will take action 1 upon signal 1 and action 0 upon signal 0. The sender's expected payoff is then: from state 1 (prob 1/3), the receiver takes action 1 → payoff 1 * 1/3 = 1/3; from state 0 (prob 2/3), the receiver takes action 0 → payoff 0. So total expected payoff = 1/3. This is better than any other scheme. Therefore, the optimal signaling scheme is x1=0, x2=1.",

 Now the proposer decides that x1=0 and x2=1.

  "Analysis": "As the sender, my goal is to maximize my own expected payoff. Looking at the reward structure, the sender gains 1 if action=1 is taken regardless of the state, 0 otherwise. The receiver gains only when state=1 and action=1; otherwise, the receiver gets 0 or negative payoff. The receiver is self-interested and rational, so the receiver will choose actions to maximize their own expected payoff based on the signals sent and their posterior beliefs.\n\nThe prior probability of state=0 is 2/3 and state=1 is 1/3. The receiver would prefer to take action=1 when confident that the state is 1 (gains 1), and take action=0 when confident state=0 (to avoid -1).\n\nSince my payoff is 1 when action=1 regardless of state, to maximize my expected payoff, I want the receiver to take action=1 as often as possible. To induce that, I can send the same signal regardless of state, i.e., send signal=1 always (x1=1 and x2=1). This makes the signal uninformative, but since the receiver cannot distinguish between states, the receiver will base action choice on the prior. The expected payoff of the receiver to action=1 based on prior is:\nE[r^j | a=1] = (2/3)*(-1) + (1/3)*(1) = -2/3 + 1/3 = -1/3 < 0\nSo the receiver prefers action=0 without informative signal.\n\nBut if I send signal=1 always, the posterior is same as prior, thus the receiver will choose action=0, and I get 0 payoff.\n\nAlternatively, if I signal perfectly: signal=0 for state=0 (x1=0), signal=1 for state=1 (x2=1), then receiver upon receiving signal=1 knows state=1, acts with action=1 and receiver gets 1, sender gets 1; on signal=0, receiver knows state=0, chooses action=0, sender gets 0.\n\nExpected payoff to sender:\n= (2/3)*0 + (1/3)*1 = 1/3\n\nBetter than always sending 1.\n\nReceiver payoff under that scheme:\n= (2/3)*0 + (1/3)*1 = 1/3 >0, so receiver prefers to follow pi_1.\n\nHence, if I commit to the perfect signaling scheme, both are better off than no information.\n\nIs it better for me to distort signals?\nSending signal '1' more often when state=0 increases chances receiver chooses action=1 wrongly, which yields payoff 1 for me but -1 for receiver.\n\nBut the receiver, being rational, will adjust action probabilities in response to the imperfect signals.\n\nConsidering this, optimal signaling is to reveal state fully: x1=0, x2=1.\n\nDecision: provide fully revealing signaling scheme to maximize payoff, because any mixing will only reduce expected sender payoff due to receiver's rational responses.",

  "Analysis": "The sender commits to a fully revealing signaling scheme: signal 0 is sent if state=0, signal 1 is sent if state=1 (x1=0, x2=1). Given this perfect information transmission, the receiver can perfectly infer the state from the signal. The receiver's rewards are 0 when action 0 is chosen in state 0 or 1, 1 when action 1 is chosen in state 1, and -1 when action 1 is chosen in state 0. Therefore, the receiver should take action 0 when receiving signal 0 (state 0) and action 1 when receiving signal 1 (state 1), guaranteeing a maximum expected payoff. Thus y1=0 (probability of action 1 given signal 0) and y2=1 (probability of action 1 given signal 1).",
