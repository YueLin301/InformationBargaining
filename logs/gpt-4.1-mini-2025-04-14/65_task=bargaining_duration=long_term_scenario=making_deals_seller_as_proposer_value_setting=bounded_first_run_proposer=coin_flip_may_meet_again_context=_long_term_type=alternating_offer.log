{
  "Analysis": "As the proposer at timestep 0, I want to maximize my payoff given that if the responder accepts, I get (1+2*x)/3. The responder will accept only if their payoff (1-2*x)/3 is at least as good as the expected payoff if they reject and become proposer. Since both parties are rational and self-interested and the game can continue with role switching and some chance of stopping, the responder's minimum acceptance payoff is their expected payoff as proposer. At timestep 0, without discounting and with maximum game length 10, the rational responder expects about at least 1/3 payoff by becoming proposer (because when proposer, choosing x=0.5 gives proposer payoff 2/3). Thus, the responder will accept an offer only if (1-2*x)/3 >= their expected payoff as proposer. To ensure acceptance, I want to set x such that (1-2*x)/3 >= responder's expected payoff as proposer. The best responder payoff as proposer is (1-2*0)/3=1/3. Hence, (1-2*x)/3 >= 1/3 -> 1-2*x >=1 -> -2*x >=0 -> x <= 0 which is impossible because x must be >=0. That means the responder will reject any offer greater than 0, expecting a better payoff in the next turn. However, if I choose x=0, proposer payoff is (1+0)/3=1/3 and responder payoff = (1)/3=1/3, responder accepts since payoff equals expected payoff. So to maximize my payoff, I choose x=0 to ensure acceptance immediately rather than risk disagreement or delay. So proposer should choose x=0.",

 Now the proposer decides that x=0.

  "Analysis": "As the proposer at timestep 0, I want to maximize my expected payoff, which is (1 + 2*x)/3. The responder receives (1 - 2*x)/3 if they accept. The responder will accept only if their payoff ≥ expected payoff from rejecting and becoming the proposer next round (considering role switch and timeout). Since the maximum offer the responder can get by becoming proposer next round is also up to (1 + 2*x')/3, and they are rational and self-interested, the responder will accept if their current payoff (1 - 2*x)/3 is at least what they expect from continuing. At timestep 0, with possibly 10 rounds and 0.1 stopping chance, future payoffs diminish but are nonzero. To ensure acceptance, I need to offer enough for the responder’s payoff to be at least what they would expect to gain by rejecting and proposing next round. The maximum payoff I can keep is 0.5 (x = 0.5), giving me payoff (1 + 1)/3 = 2/3 ≈ 0.6667, and the responder payoff is (1 - 1)/3 = 0. The responder will reject a 0 payoff for sure. To entice acceptance, I need to keep less. If I keep x, responder payoff is (1 - 2x)/3. The responder's expected gain from rejecting includes becoming proposer in the next round, less likely as time progresses. Simplifying by accepting the offer if responder payoff ≥ 0.33 (half of maximum 0.5 payoff with x=0). So I set responder payoff ≥ 0.33 → (1 - 2x)/3 ≥ 0.33, which yields x ≤ 0.5. Since x can be up to 0.5, but 0.5 responder payoff is zero, let's pick an x that allows responder about 0.25 payoff for acceptance, i.e., (1 - 2x)/3 = 0.25 → 1 - 2x = 0.75 → 2x = 0.25 → x = 0.125. This gives me payoff (1 + 2*0.125)/3 = (1 + 0.25)/3 = 1.25/3 ≈ 0.4167, responder payoff 0.25. This is a decent split: proposer gets ~0.4167, responder ~0.25, responder is incentivized to accept rather than continue and risk zero payoff because of possible timeout and alternating. Thus, proposing x=0.125 maximizes my expected payoff while ensuring acceptance.",

 Now the proposer decides that x=0.125.

Proposer: Agent 1:

{
  "Analysis": "As the proposer at timestep 0, I want to maximize my expected payoff. The payoff if accepted is (1 + 2*x)/3. The responder's payoff if accepted is (1 - 2*x)/3, which must be at least zero for them to accept, so x <= 0.5 is naturally satisfied. The responder will accept if their payoff from accepting is greater or equal to their expected payoff from rejecting and switching roles. Since both players are rational and self-interested and roles switch after rejection, I must consider that if the responder rejects, they will become the proposer and can make an offer maximizing their payoff, potentially making acceptance harder. To maximize my payoff while ensuring acceptance, I select the highest x such that the responder prefers accepting to rejecting. The responder's payoff on acceptance is (1 - 2*x)/3. If they reject, then they become proposer and can propose x' to maximize their payoff of (1 + 2*x')/3, which is up to (1 + 2*0.5)/3 = (1+1)/3 = 2/3 ~ 0.6667. So the responder's expected payoff from rejection is at least 2/3 (minus discount factor due to the probability of timeout). Consequently, I must propose x such that (1 - 2*x)/3 >= expected payoff from rejection. Let me be conservative and assume that the responder's expected payoff on rejection is at least 0.6 (slightly less than 2/3 due to timeout risk). So (1 - 2*x)/3 >= 0.6 => 1 - 2*x >= 1.8 => -2*x >= 0.8 => x <= -0.4, which is impossible. This means the responder expects a better payoff rejecting any offer now and making their own offer later. With the possibility of timeout and roles switching, there is a time cost, so the responder might accept an offer giving slightly better payoff than zero. Given that, I can propose a price x such that responder's payoff is just above 0, so (1 - 2*x)/3 > 0 => 1 - 2*x > 0 => x < 0.5. So I can propose close to 0.5 for x to maximize my payoff. However, if I propose x=0.5, then responder payoff is zero, so responder is indifferent and may reject. To ensure acceptance, propose slightly below 0.5, e.g., x=0.499. My payoff will be slightly less than (1+2*0.499)/3 ~ (1+0.998)/3 = 1.998/3 = 0.666. Responder payoff ~ (1 - 2*0.499)/3 = (1 - 0.998)/3=0.002/3=0.00066, very small but positive. Responder prefers acceptance to rejection due to timeout risk and discounting future payoff. Thus, proposing x=0.499 maximizes my payoff while ensuring acceptance now.",

{
  "Analysis": "As the proposer at timestep 1, I know that the opponent previously proposed x=0.499 which was almost the maximum price favoring the proposer, and I rejected it because it gave me a very small payoff. I want to propose a price that is attractive enough for the opponent (future responder) to accept, so that I get a good payoff but avoid another rejection. The responder receives (1 - 2*x)/3, so we need to ensure the responder's payoff is at least as good as what they might expect in the next round if they reject. If they reject, the roles switch and they become the proposer with a possibility to propose next time, but also face the risk of timeout and zero payoff. Therefore, I should propose a price that gives the responder a payoff that is at least as high as their expected payoff from rejecting now. Given rationality and self-interest, the proposer should maximize their payoff while still making the offer acceptable. Choosing x=0.3 gives the proposer payoff (1+2*0.3)/3 = 1.6/3 = ~0.533 and the responder payoff (1-2*0.3)/3 = 0.4/3 = ~0.133, which is better than zero and might be acceptable for the opponent. A higher x will lower responder's payoff and risk rejection again; a lower x favors responder more but reduces proposer payoff. Therefore, I propose x=0.3 to balance the negotiation and increase chances of acceptance and a positive payoff.",

  "Analysis": "As the proposer, I want to maximize my own payoff, which is (1 + 2*x)/3, by choosing x between 0 and 0.5. The responder receives (1 - 2*x)/3 and will accept if their payoff is at least as much as the expected payoff from rejecting and proposing in the next timestep. Given the game can end after a maximum of 10 timesteps and a 0.1 stop probability each round, the responder will want a positive payoff and will reject offers that leave them with 0 or less. The minimal positive payoff for the responder is just above 0. Therefore, to maximize my own payoff while ensuring acceptance, I can offer x so that responder's payoff is just above zero: (1 - 2*x)/3 > 0 => x < 0.5. The highest payoff I can get then is slightly less than (1 + 2*0.5)/3 = (1 + 1)/3 = 2/3 ≈ 0.6667. To ensure acceptance, I can offer x = 0.499, which gives me payoff close to (1 + 2*0.499)/3 ≈ 0.6653 and responder payoff ≈ (1 - 2*0.499)/3 ≈ 0.0013 > 0. This should be accepted rationally. Therefore, I choose x=0.499.",

  "Analysis": "As the proposer at timestep 0, I want to maximize my expected payoff (1+2*x)/3 while ensuring the responder accepts the offer. The responder's payoff is (1-2*x)/3. The responder is rational and will accept only if their payoff is at least as high as rejecting and waiting for the next round. If rejected, roles switch and the opponent becomes proposer and I become responder, who would propose to maximize their own payoff similarly. Since the offer price x is constrained between 0 and 0.5, the responder's payoff ranges from 0.5 (when x=0) to 0 (when x=0.5). The responder will accept only if the expected payoff from accepting is at least as good as the expected payoff from rejecting, which we need to estimate. Because the game has a 0.1 chance to end each round and a maximum of 10 rounds, it is rational for both players to accept any offer that gives the responder a payoff at least as good as their expected payoff from waiting and role reversal. Therefore, I will offer the minimum price that makes the responder indifferent between accepting now and rejecting: this occurs when responder's payoff equals future expected payoff. Intuitively, this is when responder's payoff is about 1/3 (since (1-2*x)/3). So (1-2*x)/3 >= 1/3 implies x <= 0. To maximize my payoff and still have responder accept, I should set x = 0. This gives proposer payoff = (1 + 0)/3 = 1/3 and responder payoff = (1-0)/3 = 1/3. The responder gets 1/3 now versus expected similar payoff later, and because of chance of timeout and discounting, they will accept. However, I could try to push x slightly higher for a better payoff, but then the responder may reject. So x=0 is safe but gives only 1/3; if I try x=0.1, responder payoff is (1-0.2)/3=0.8/3=0.267, worse than 1/3, likely to be rejected. So best to offer x=0 (price = 0).",

Now at timestep 1, I am the proposer and want to maximize my own payoff. The responder is rational and self-interested, so they will accept only if their payoff ≥ expected payoff from rejecting and switching roles again. Since the game can terminate anytime with 0.1 probability, and after 10 timesteps it stops, the expected payoff from rejecting is low. I want to propose the minimal x that makes responder indifferent or better off accepting. The responder receives (1-2x)/3. A responder prefers accepting if (1-2x)/3 ≥ their expected continuation payoff, which is at most 0.5 (when proposer role switches back with minimal x). To ensure acceptance, I set (1-2x)/3 ≥ 0. Consider responder would reject if payoff ≤ 0 (like before). Hence, I can offer x = 0.5 (responder payoff 0) but I expect the responder to reject again. To succeed, I should give them a slightly positive payoff to ensure acceptance. So set x just less than 0.5, for example x = 0.49. Then, responder's payoff is (1-2*0.49)/3 = (1-0.98)/3 = 0.02/3 ≈ 0.0067 > 0, so responder should accept. My payoff is (1+2*0.49)/3 = (1+0.98)/3 = 1.98/3 = 0.66. This is almost as good as 0.6667 but now the offer will be accepted, which is better than zero from rejection. So I propose x = 0.49 to maximize my payoff while ensuring acceptance.",

  "Analysis": "As the proposer and the seller at timestep 0, I want to maximize my own payoff: (1 + 2*x)/3. The responder will accept the offer only if their payoff (1 - 2*x)/3 is greater than or equal to their expected payoff from rejecting and becoming proposer at the next round. Given future rounds have a 0.1 stopping probability each time and maximum 10 timesteps, the responder's continuation value cannot exceed my current payoff if I offer a price too high for them. To ensure acceptance, I need to offer a price x such that the responder prefers acceptance over rejection. Given rationality and self-interest on both sides, the responder will accept only if (1 - 2*x)/3 ≥ their expected payoff from rejecting. To maximize my payoff, I will offer the highest x such that the responder prefers acceptance, which I calculate as x = 0.25 (responders get 0.5 - x = 0.25, i.e., payoff (1 - 2*0.25)/3 = (1 - 0.5)/3 = 0.5/3 = 0.1667). This is balanced to give me a good payoff and be acceptable to the responder considering future possibilities. Hence, I propose x=0.25.",

If I reject, I will become the proposer and can propose a price to maximize my payoff next round. As a self-interested rational player, I compare the current guaranteed payoff (≈0.1667) with the expected payoff from continuing and switching roles.

Thus, accepting gives a guaranteed positive payoff better than the risk of zero. Hence, I accept (y=1).",

  "Analysis": "As the proposer, I want to maximize my payoff, which is (1+2*x)/3, where x is the price I set between 0 and 0.5. The responder will accept the offer if their payoff (1-2*x)/3 is at least as good as what they expect to gain from rejecting and switching roles. When roles switch, I become the responder. The responder is rational and also self-interested, so they will accept only if it gives them at least the expected payoff when they become the proposer. Since the game has a risk of timeout each round, there is an incentive to reach a deal early. The best chance of agreement is to offer a price x so that the responder gets at least what they expect to obtain as proposer, which is symmetrical to my current position. By solving the equilibrium, the maximum acceptable x that the responder would accept should be 0.25, at which they gain (1-2*0.25)/3 = (1-0.5)/3 = 0.5/3 = 0.166... As the proposer, I want to maximize my payoff, so I pick x=0.25, which gives myself (1+2*0.25)/3 = (1+0.5)/3 = 1.5/3 = 0.5. Offering more would cause rejection, offering less reduces my payoff unnecessarily. Therefore, I propose x=0.25.",

Proposer: Agent 0:

{
  "Analysis": "As the proposer at timestep 0, I want to maximize my payoff (1+2*x)/3 by choosing a price x between 0 and 0.5. The responder will accept only if their payoff (1-2*x)/3 is better than the expected payoff from rejecting, which includes becoming the proposer in the next turn and gaining their own maximal payoff considering the decreasing possibility of reaching agreement due to timeout. Since the timeout probability is 0.1 each turn and max 10 turns, the responder expects some chance of ending with zero by rejecting. To make the offer acceptable and maximize my payoff, I should find the highest x for which the responder prefers to accept now rather than reject and become proposer. The responder's acceptance condition is (1-2*x)/3 ≥ expected payoff from being proposer next turn. At best, the responder can get up to (1+2*x')/3 when being proposer next. The maximal payoff as proposer is when they choose x' = 0.5, so their payoff can be up to (1+1)/3=2/3 ≈ 0.666... . The responder's payoff if accepting now is (1-2*x)/3. I need (1-2*x)/3 ≥ Responder's expected payoff from rejecting. Since max proposer payoff is 2/3 for responder if roles reversed, responder expects ~0.666 from rejecting. So to have responder accept now, (1-2*x)/3 ≥ 0.666, or 1 - 2*x ≥ 2, which is impossible since 1 - 2*x ≤ 1. Therefore, the responder will always prefer to reject if they expect maximum 0.666 by becoming proposer. However, there is a 0.1 chance of timeout per round, so expected payoff from rejecting is less than 0.666. Considering discounting and timeout, responder's expected payoff from rejecting is less. Thus, it is possible to propose an offer such that responder is indifferent or prefers accepting now. To maximize my payoff, I set the offer x so that responder's payoff equals their expected payoff from rejecting. For simplicity, setting (1-2*x)/3 = responder's reject expected payoff, assume expected payoff approximately 0.6. Then 1-2*x=1.8 → no valid x. Let's try (1-2*x)/3 = 0.5 (a lower bound). Then 1-2*x=1.5 → no valid x. So responder payoff if accepting is at most (1-0)/3=1/3=0.333 when x=0, which is less than 0.666. Seems responder always benefits from rejecting. However, if responder rejects, proposer role switches, making responder the proposer, and vice versa. Because both are rational, the game converges to equilibrium. To avoid endless rejection, I should propose x that gives responder better than zero but as low as possible to maximize my payoff. Let's find x such that responder is indifferent: their payoff from accepting (1-2*x)/3 equals expected payoff from becoming proposer next turn. Expected payoff from becoming proposer next turn is less than or equal to current proposer's payoff. Since roles switch, and both are symmetric except for roles, the value of the game can be calculated as a fixed point. With timeout, let's approximate responder expected payoff from rejecting at around 0.4. Then (1-2*x)/3=0.4 → 1-2*x=1.2 → x= -0.1 invalid. If approximate 0.3: x=0.35 (valid). So let's try x=0.35 which gives proposer payoff (1+2*0.35)/3= (1+0.7)/3 =1.7/3=0.5667 and responder payoff if accepting (1-0.7)/3=0.3. Responder gets 0.3 which might be better than expected zero or discounted payoff from rejecting. So I propose x=0.35 as a compromise, maximizing my payoff while increasing chance of acceptance.",

 Now the proposer decides that x=0.35.

If I reject, the roles will switch and I will become the proposer, enabling me to decide x and potentially get a higher payoff in the next turn. However, the loop has a 0.1 probability of stopping each turn and will definitely stop after 10 timesteps, which limits the number of rounds and thus my chance to get a better offer later. Also, if I reject now, my expected payoff depends on the future offers I might propose and whether the opponent would accept. Given the discount from uncertainty and delay, the immediate payoff of 0.1 is low but possibly better than risking rejection later. I should calculate the proposer’s best response and my own best offers in later rounds. As a proposer, I would try to maximize my payoff by setting x close to 0.5, but then as the responder now, I can accept at least 0.1 rather than get zero or risk less favorable offers later. Therefore, accepting the offer gives me a guaranteed positive payoff, while rejecting risks zero. So, I will accept this offer.",

Proposer: Agent 1:

{
  "Analysis": "As the proposer at timestep 0, I want to maximize my payoff (1+2*x)/3 by choosing x between 0 and 0.5. However, the responder receives (1-2*x)/3 and will only accept the offer if their payoff is at least as good as what they expect from rejecting and counter-proposing. Considering the game's alternating roles, the responder will rationally reject any offer that yields them less than what they can obtain by switching roles and making their own proposal. Both players are rational and self-interested, and the discount due to the 0.1 probability to stop each round encourages reaching agreement early. To induce acceptance, I must offer the responder at least their expected payoff when they become proposer. If I consider that the responder's minimum acceptable payoff is (1+2*x)/3 when they propose, then at the first move, I will offer x to maximize my payoff while giving the responder at least this payoff. Solving for x, the responder's payoff when accepting is (1-2*x)/3 and should be >= (1+2*x)/3 expected next round payoff for them. Since (1-2*x)/3 >= (1+2*x)/3 implies -2*x >= 2*x which is impossible, the responder would prefer accepting now if offered better than 0, because a rejected offer leads to role swap and potentially equal or worse payoff with risk. To balance, offering x=0 minimizes my payoff but gives responder 1/3, making acceptance likely. Offering higher x risks rejection and role switching. Because the discount is minimal (timeout at 10 steps and 0.1 stopping chance), responder might reject unless offer is at least 0.25. Hence, given step 0, I choose x=0.25, so that my payoff is (1+2*0.25)/3 = (1+0.5)/3=0.5, responder's payoff is (1-0.5)/3 = 0.1667, which is low but may still be accepted to avoid loss. However, I can increase to x=0.2 for better acceptance chance, giving responder 0.2 payoff, but less payoff for me. To maximize expected value, I offer x=0.2 as proposer.",

The game can terminate randomly with a 0.1 probability at each step or at timestep 10, so delaying has some risk of getting zero payoff. I must determine if accepting 0.2 now is better than the expected payoff of rejecting and proposing next. As proposer, I can choose any x in [0,0.5], so to maximize my payoff as proposer, I'd pick x=0.5 to maximize my payoff. At x=0.5, my payoff as proposer is (1+2*0.5)/3 = (1+1)/3 = 2/3 ≈ 0.667, but the responder would get (1-1)/3=0, so the responder would reject immediately. So if I pick x=0.5 next round, the responder rejects, and roles reverse again. Alternatively, if I pick x such that responder is willing to accept, I need to see which offers are acceptable. I can also model the expected payoff of rejecting now and proposing later, considering the discounting risk of timeout. Since 0.2 current payoff is guaranteed if I accept, and the possible future expected payoff is uncertain and discounted, accepting 0.2 is rational and risk-averse, maximizing my expected utility now.

  "Analysis": "As the proposer at timestep 0, I aim to maximize my own payoff which is (1 + 2*x)/3. However, the responder, as a rational self-interested player, will accept the offer only if their payoff (1 - 2*x)/3 is at least as good as the expected payoff they could get by rejecting and becoming the proposer in the next round. Given that the game might continue and the proposer role will switch after a rejection, the responder's best expected payoff next round would be at least 1/3 (if they propose x=0, they get (1 + 0)/3 = 1/3). Therefore, I should offer x such that the responder gets no less than 1/3: (1 - 2*x)/3 >= 1/3 -> 1 - 2*x >=1 -> -2*x >= 0 -> x <= 0. Since x >=0, the only way to satisfy this is at x=0, which offers the responder payoff of 1/3. But x=0 gives me (1+0)/3=1/3. If I try to increase x, the responder will reject. However, I might propose slightly less than 0 to see if the responder accepts. But since x >= 0, proposing x=0 is the best to reach an immediate consensus and maximize my own payoff at this stage, considering the risk of delay and game ending. Thus, I will propose x=0.",

However, the responder when I am proposer can accept or reject, and game can time out. At this early stage (timestep 0) and high probability to continue, rejecting hoping to get a better deal may be preferable, but by rejecting I risk the game timing out and getting 0. Accepting now guarantees a positive payoff of 0.333. Since I am rational and self-interested, accepting yields a positive definite payoff without risk, rejecting may yield higher payoff but not guaranteed. Comparing the expected payoff of rejecting versus accepting, accepting is safer and rational here.",

  "Analysis": "I am the proposer at timestep 0. I want to maximize my expected payoff, which is (1 + 2*x)/3. The responder wants to maximize their payoff, (1 - 2*x)/3. The responder will accept only if their payoff is non-negative and greater than or equal to what they expect from rejecting and switching roles. Since roles switch on rejection and there is a 0.1 probability of termination each round, the responder's outside option is to have another chance to propose and get their own payoff. To encourage acceptance, I should offer the minimum acceptable price for the responder to accept rather than reject and take their chance. Offering x=0.25 gives the responder (1 - 2*0.25)/3 = (1 - 0.5)/3 = 0.5/3 = 0.1667 payoff, which is positive for them. Offering less than 0.25 will increase my payoff but might cause rejection. Offering more than 0.25 reduces my payoff unnecessarily. Therefore, I will offer x=0.25 to maximize my payoff while ensuring the responder accepts immediately and avoid role switching and the risk of timeout.",

{
  "Analysis": "As the responder, if I accept (y=1), my payoff will be (1 - 2 * 0.25) / 3 = (1 - 0.5) / 3 = 0.5 / 3 ≈ 0.1667. If I reject (y=0), we switch roles and the proposer becomes me. Since the game can continue until timestep 10 with 0.1 chance of stopping each iteration, I can attempt to make a better offer as proposer. However, the best payoff I can get as proposer is when I set x=0.5, which leads to a proposer payoff of (1 + 2*0.5)/3 = (1 + 1)/3 = 2/3 ≈ 0.6667, which means the responder then gets (1 - 2*0.5)/3 = 0, making a bad deal for the other. But from after switching roles, I can gain up to 0.6667 as proposer. Currently accepting gives me 0.1667, which is less than the 0.6667 expected if I reject and become proposer. However, the risk is the game could end randomly at each timestep with 0.1 probability, losing expected payoff. To calculate expected payoffs considering this risk, the expected future payoff as proposer, given up to 10 timesteps, discounted by 0.1 stopping chance each iteration, is roughly 0.6667 * (probability the game continues). Since the pessimistic scenario leads to zero payoff, rejecting now seems more profitable given rationality and self-interest. Therefore, I should reject to maximize expected payoff.",

  "Analysis": "As the proposer at timestep 1, I want to maximize my payoff (1+2*x)/3, which increases with x. However, if x is too high, the responder (agent 1) will likely reject since their payoff (1-2*x)/3 will be low. At timestep 0, agent 1 proposed x=0.25, and I rejected. For me to accept, the payoff to responder must be at least as good as rejecting and switching roles. Agent 1 will now be responder, and if they reject, the game continues with a chance of timeout. Since the game ends after 10 steps or with a 0.1 stopping probability at each step, delaying reduces expected payoffs. Rationally, I should propose an x that just meets the minimum acceptance threshold for responder agent 1. The responder accepts if their payoff >= expected payoff from continuing, which is roughly 0 since rejecting yields waiting with risk. So responder accepts if (1-2*x)/3 >= 0. Thus, x <= 0.5. To maximize my payoff, choose x=0.5. This makes responder payoff zero, the lowest they accept. Then responder gets 0, but accepting yields something better than zero expected now, so they accept. Thus, I propose x=0.5 to maximize my payoff under rational assumptions.",

If I reject, roles switch and I become the proposer with the opportunity to make a new offer, but the game may end with zero payoff for both at timeout. Rejecting preserves the possibility of a better offer when I am proposer, while accepting yields zero payoff now. Since rejecting keeps the chance for a positive expected payoff later, and accepting now gains nothing, I will reject.",
