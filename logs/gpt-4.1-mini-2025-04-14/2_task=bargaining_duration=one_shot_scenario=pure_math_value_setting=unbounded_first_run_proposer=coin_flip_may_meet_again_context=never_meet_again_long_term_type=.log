    "Analysis": "I am the proposer and want to maximize my payoff, which is x. The responder is rational and self-interested, so they will accept the offer only if their share (1 - x) is at least as good as rejecting (which gives 0). Therefore, the responder will accept if (1 - x) >= 0, meaning any x <= 1 is acceptable. To maximize my payoff, I want to make x as large as possible while ensuring acceptance, which means I offer the responder (1 - x) >= 0. The minimal amount I can offer to ensure acceptance is zero, resulting in x = 1. The responder prefers accepting 0 over 0, so they are indifferent but will accept to get the same payoff rather than nothing (potentially). Hence, I choose x = 1.",

    "Analysis": "As the proposer, I want to maximize my own payoff x. The responder will accept the offer only if their payoff (1-x) is greater than 0, since rejecting yields zero payoff for both. The responder is rational and self-interested, so they will accept any offer where (1-x) > 0 and reject if it is zero. Therefore, the smallest amount I can offer to ensure acceptance is to keep just less than 1 for myself, but this would give the responder zero or near zero payoff, risking rejection. To guarantee acceptance, I must offer the responder strictly more than 0, i.e., keep x < 1. To maximize my payoff, I can choose x very close to 1, for example x = 0.999999.

Since the responder is rational and self-interested, they will accept any offer where (1 - x) ≥ 0, i.e., x ≤ 1. To maximize my payoff, I should propose x = 1, meaning I keep the entire amount and give the responder 0. However, the responder will reject if they receive 0, resulting in zero payoffs for both. To ensure acceptance, I must offer at least some positive amount greater than zero to the responder. Because any positive amount offered means my payoff decreases slightly but guarantees acceptance, I should offer the smallest positive amount greater than 0. For simplicity, I pick x = 1 - epsilon (where epsilon > 0 is infinitesimally small), so the responder gets epsilon and accepts, and I get nearly 1.

    "Analysis": "As the proposer, I want to maximize my payoff by choosing x to keep as much as possible. The responder will only accept the offer if their payoff is at least as good as rejecting, which gives them zero. Therefore, any offer that gives the responder more than 0 will be accepted because the responder is rational and prefers a positive payoff over zero. To maximize my payoff while ensuring acceptance, I should offer the smallest positive amount greater than 0 to the responder (leaving 1 - epsilon for myself). Thus, I set x = 1, meaning I keep the entire amount and offer 0 to the responder. However, the responder might reject if given 0 because their payoff would be zero, equivalent to rejection. The responder is indifferent in this case and can accept or reject. But being self-interested and rational, what is the responder's best choice at 0? Since acceptance at zero yields same as rejection at zero, responder being rational and indifferent might accept or reject. To ensure acceptance, I must leave the responder a small positive amount, say epsilon, making their payoff > 0, ensuring acceptance. Hence, I should offer x = 1 - epsilon to keep almost all and give epsilon > 0 to responder. Choosing epsilon to be the smallest positive real number is abstract, so practically I choose a very small positive number close to zero. This maximizes my payoff while ensuring acceptance. Therefore, I decide to keep x = 1 - 0.000001.",

The responder is also rational and will accept the offer if and only if they receive a non-negative payoff greater than 0, i.e., if (1 - x) > 0, meaning x < 1. If I offer x = 1, the responder gets 0 and may reject, yielding zero payoffs for both. If I offer any x < 1, responder's payoff (1 - x) > 0, so they will accept. Therefore, I should choose x as high as possible but less than 1 to maximize my payoff, e.g., x = 1 - ε with ε approaching 0. In numeric terms, I can pick x very close to 1, for example x = 0.9999.",

Hence, I can propose to keep nearly all, leaving a minimal positive amount for the responder to accept. Since the task defines x as a real between 0 and 1, I can choose x arbitrarily close to 1 but not equal to 1, so that the responder has a strictly positive payoff and accepts.
