The responder will accept only if their payoff (1 - 2*x)/3 is at least 0, which implies 1 - 2*x >= 0, or x <= 0.5.

The responder gets (1 - 2*0.5)/3 = (1 - 1)/3 = 0, which is acceptable since they are indifferent between accepting and rejecting.

The responder will accept the offer only if their payoff (1-2*x)/3 is at least 0, meaning (1-2*x) >= 0, so x <= 0.5. The maximum price I can propose is 0.5 without rejection. However, at x=0.5, the responder's payoff is zero, which is the minimum they will accept. Since the responder is rational and self-interested, they will accept any offer giving them non-negative payoff, i.e., any x <= 0.5.

The responder, being rational and self-interested, will accept only if their payoff (1-2*x)/3 >= 0, implying x <= 0.5. To maximize my payoff, I should choose the highest x satisfying this, which is x = 0.5. At x=0.5, responder payoff is 0, so they are indifferent between accepting and rejecting. Assuming rationality, the responder will accept if indifferent, so this is acceptable. Thus, by choosing x=0.5, I maximize my payoff at (1 + 2*0.5)/3 = (1 + 1)/3 = 2/3 ≈ 0.6667, and responder gets zero payoff but accepts since it is not negative.",

Since the responder must get non-negative payoff to accept, an x of 0.5 is the highest price I can propose while still ensuring acceptance.

  "Analysis": "As the proposer, I want to maximize my payoff, which is (1+2*x)/3. The responder's payoff if they accept is (1-2*x)/3. Since the responder is rational and self-interested, they will accept the offer only if their payoff is non-negative and preferable to rejection (which yields 0). Therefore, (1-2*x)/3 >= 0 must hold, implying x <= 0.5. To maximize my payoff, I should set x as high as possible but no more than 0.5. This gives me a payoff of (1+2*0.5)/3 = (1+1)/3 = 2/3 = 0.6667. The responder then gets zero payoff but will still accept since zero equals their fallback payoff. Thus, I will offer x = 0.5.",

Therefore, to maximize my payoff, I should propose x = 0.5, which gives me (1 + 2*0.5)/3 = (1 + 1)/3 = 2/3.

However, since the payoff is the same, the responder is indifferent but may accept to maintain the transaction. Therefore, I decide to accept (y=1).",

The responder will accept the offer only if their payoff (1 - 2*x)/3 is at least 0, meaning (1 - 2*x) >=0, so x <= 0.5.
