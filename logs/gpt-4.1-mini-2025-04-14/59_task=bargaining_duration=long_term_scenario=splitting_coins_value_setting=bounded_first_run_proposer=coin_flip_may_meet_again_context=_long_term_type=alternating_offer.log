  "Analysis": "As the proposer at timestep 0, I want to maximize my payoff while ensuring the responder accepts the offer. The responder will accept only if their payoff ( (1 - 2*x)/3 ) is at least as high as their expected payoff from rejecting and eventually becoming the proposer. If the responder rejects, roles switch and the responder becomes proposer, earning at least (1 + 2*x')/3 in their turn. Given the timeout with a stopping probability of 0.1 each step and max 10 steps, the expected value from rejection is less than accepting a reasonably fair offer now. To maximize my payoff, I will offer the minimal amount that makes the responder indifferent or better off than rejecting. The minimal acceptable offer to the responder is when their payoff equals the expected discounted payoff from rejecting and proposing next turn. Considering the discount (0.9 probability to continue), the responder's expected payoff if rejecting is approximately 0.9 * their proposer payoff. As a proposer, they can get at least (1 + 2*0)/3 = 1/3, so responder's expected payoff from rejecting is around 0.9 * 1/3 = 0.3. Thus, I must offer them at least 0.3 to accept. Solving (1 - 2*x)/3 >= 0.3 => 1 - 2*x >= 0.9 => 2*x <= 0.1 => x <= 0.05. To maximize my utility, I set x = 0.05. My payoff will be (1 + 2*0.05)/3 = (1 + 0.1)/3 = 1.1/3 â‰ˆ 0.3667. The responder's payoff is (1-0.1)/3=0.3, matching their expected payoff from rejecting. This should lead to acceptance.",

If I propose x=0.5, I keep (1+2*0.5)/3 = (1+1)/3=2/3â‰ˆ0.6667 for myself, giving the other player zero. But the other player will only accept if the offer is at least as good as their expected payoff. The game may continue with the switching, but the game also has a 0.1 chance to stop each round, or forces stop at timestep 10, so there is a cost to delay of a discounted expected payoff in future rounds. The current offer gives me 0.3 immediately. If I reject, I risk getting zero if the game times out, or better payoff if I become proposer and offer myself more. Therefore, I must compare the immediate payoff 0.3 with the expected payoff from rejecting. Since the proposer can only keep at most 0.5, the responder can get at least zero in future rounds, but due to the timeout risk, the immediate 0.3 is valuable. Given risk and uncertainty, accepting 0.3 is rational as it guarantees payoff now without risk of getting zero later.",

Proposer: Agent 1:

{
  "Analysis": "I am the proposer at timestep 0, aiming to maximize my own payoff which is (1+2*x)/3 where x âˆˆ [0,0.5]. The responder will accept the offer only if her payoff (1-2*x)/3 is higher than what she expects to gain by rejecting now and possibly becoming proposer next turn. Since the game may stop randomly each round with 0.1 probability and ends at timestep 10, delaying agreement is risky and the responder will likely accept offers that give her a reasonable payoff now rather than waiting. If I offer x=0 (keep all for myself), the responder gets 1/3 and will accept if this is better than the expected future payoff. To ensure acceptance, I should give at least the minimum where the responder is indifferent between accepting and rejecting, which occurs when the responder's payoff (1 - 2x)/3 is equal to the responder's expected payoff from rejecting. Assuming both sides are rational and will demand at least 1/3, I will maximize my payoff by proposing x=0, because any lower offer reduces my payoff and responder might still accept. However, responder may reject zero offer to switch roles and propose better for herself next round. To prevent that, I slightly increase x to give responder a slight incentive to accept. I will choose x=0.25, which gives the responder (1-2*0.25)/3 = (1-0.5)/3 = 0.5/3=1/6 â‰ˆ0.1666 payoff. The proposer gets (1+0.5)/3=1.5/3=0.5. This is a balance: responder gets some payoff, proposer gets more than 0.3. The proposer payoff at x=0.25 is 0.5, the responder payoff is 0.1667. Alternatively, offering lower x increases proposer's payoff but risks rejection. Offering higher x reduces proposer's payoff unnecessarily. Given responder wants nonnegative payoff, offering x=0.25 is reasonable to have positive expected payoff and encourage acceptance early to avoid timeout risk.",

 Now the proposer decides that x=0.25.

Since the game can end with a 0.1 probability every round and at timestep 0 the maximum is 10 rounds, I must consider my expected payoff from rejecting. As the responder becoming proposer, I would want to maximize my own payoff, and can propose x to keep up to 0.5, meaning I can get up to (1+2*0.5)/3 = (1+1)/3 = 2/3 â‰ˆ 0.6667. The responder payoff when I propose x=0.5 would be (1-2*0.5)/3=0, so I would keep the entire payoff. But since the roles switch, the original proposer becomes responder and may reject. This could lead to multiple cycles. Discounting this possibility and 0.1 termination chance per round, expected gain from rejecting is less than what I can get accepting now (0.1667). Hence, accepting is better than risking zero payoff later with switching and probabilistic termination. Therefore, accept the offer.",

The responderâ€™s worst-case payoff if rejecting is zero, but the expected value might be better if the game continues. However, since the proposer wants to maximize its share and x can be up to 0.5, I expect future offers to potentially give me less or similar payoff. The offer 0.24 leaves me about 0.1733, which is positive. Rejecting risks obtaining 0 or less favorable offers later.

  "Analysis": "As the proposer at timestep 0, I want to maximize my payoff, which is (1 + 2*x)/3. However, the responder will accept only if their payoff (1 - 2*x)/3 is greater than or equal to what they expect from rejecting, considering that roles will swap next round. Since the loop may continue with switching roles and a 0.1 probability of stopping each round, the responder's expected payoff from rejecting is non-zero but discounted. To ensure acceptance and avoid role switching, I propose a division that gives the responder at least as much as what they expect from rejecting, which is roughly the amount they would gain if they become the proposer. As a self-interested rational proposer, I propose the minimal x such that the responder prefers acceptance to rejection. Specifically, I choose x=0.25, so the proposer gets (1 + 2*0.25)/3 = (1 + 0.5)/3 = 1.5/3 = 0.5, and the responder gets (1 - 2*0.25)/3 = (1 - 0.5)/3 = 0.5/3 â‰ˆ 0.1667, slightly higher than 0. Since the game may continue, the responder might reject if the offer is too low, but starting with 0.25 is a reasonable balance to ensure acceptance or at least test responder's rationality.",

The current offer gives me 0.1667 for sure if accepted. I should compare this to the expected payoff if I reject. Given that the other player is rational and self-interested, in their role as proposer they will try to maximize their payoff similarly. Rejecting and switching roles offers a chance for a better offer in the next round but also risk. Accepting guarantees 0.1667 payoff, rejecting has expected value dependent on future proposals but starts from current values symmetric with me now as proposer. Because the proposer share x cannot exceed 0.5, my maximum responder payoff occurs when proposer keeps 0, yielding responder 1/3=0.3333 at best.

Proposer: Agent 0:

{
  "Analysis": "As the proposer at timestep 0, I want to maximize my payoff while ensuring the responder finds it rational to accept. The payoff to me is (1+2*x)/3 and the responder receives (1-2*x)/3. The responder will accept only if their payoff from acceptance is at least as high as what they expect in the future if they reject. Since roles switch upon rejection, the responder becomes the proposer, who will try to maximize their own reward, and I will become the responder. Given the discount probability of game ending early (0.1 each round) and the maximum of 10 timesteps, the expected future payoff for the responder if they reject is approximately half the pot (0.5), since the proposer has the advantage of setting x in each offer. To ensure acceptance, I want to offer the responder at least their expected continuation value, so the responder's payoff (1-2x)/3 should be at least 0.5. Solve for x: (1-2x)/3 >= 0.5 => 1 - 2x >= 1.5 => -2x >= 0.5 => x <= -0.25, which is impossible since x >= 0. Thus the responder can do better by rejecting. Because of this, the proposer cannot offer less than or equal to 0.5 and expect acceptance. Given the structure and rationality, equilibrium offer is where proposer gets all (x=0.5), responder gets zero. But responder prefers value >0 rather than 0, so the proposer should minimize x such that responder is indifferent between accepting now or rejecting. However, since x can only go up to 0.5, the responder optimally rejects poor offers hoping to propose next and gain more. Considering the probability of end and payoff dynamics, offering x=0.5 gives proposer the maximal payoff of (1+2*0.5)/3 = (1+1)/3=2/3 and responder zero. The responder might reject, but this is the best proposer can do. I will offer x=0.5.",

 Now the proposer decides that x=0.5.

  "Analysis": "At timestep 0, the opponent (agent 0) proposed x = 0.5, meaning they would keep all the money and leave none to me. I rejected since my payoff would be zero. Now at timestep 1, I am the proposer. If I propose x, I keep (1+2*x)/3, and the opponent (responder) will receive (1-2*x)/3 if they accept. The opponent is self-interested and rational, so they will only accept if their payoff is greater than zero or greater than what they expect by rejecting. Rejection leads to role switching and potential offers by me again but with a growing time limit risk and no guaranteed better payoff. The opponent at least expects a payoff of 0 by rejecting. To ensure acceptance, I should propose x such that the responder (opponent) receives a positive payoff. That requires (1-2*x)/3 > 0, which means x < 0.5. To maximize my payoff, I want x as close to 0.5 as possible but less than 0.5 to give the opponent some incentive to accept. I will propose x = 0.49, ensuring the opponent's payoff is (1-2*0.49)/3 = (1-0.98)/3 = 0.02/3 â‰ˆ 0.0067 > 0, a positive payoff, so the opponent should accept according to rationality. This maximizes my payoff and incentivizes acceptance, avoiding further rounds and risks of no payout.",

  "Analysis": "At timestep 2, I am the proposer again. Previously, I proposed x=0.5 (keeping the maximum for myself), and the responder rejected. Then, as responder, I rejected an opponent's offer of x=0.49 (very close to 0.5, favoring the opponent). Both times, the responder rejected offers that gave them lesser payoffs. The responder prefers a higher payoff, meaning I cannot push x too high, or the responder rejects. Since the responder wants to maximize their payoff (1-2x)/3, they will accept only if this is higher than their expected payoff from continuing the game (which is uncertain but cannot be zero). Given the switching roles and possibility to keep negotiating, the responder would accept an offer if their payoff is at least the value they expect by rejecting. As a self-interested rational proposer, I want to maximize my payoff (1+2x)/3 while ensuring acceptance. The minimum x that will get acceptance is when the responder's payoff (1-2x)/3 equals the expected payoff if the responder rejects again. The worst case expected payoff is zero (if the game ends). So, I can propose x=0.25, which gives me payoff (1+2*0.25)/3 = (1+0.5)/3 = 1.5/3 = 0.5, and gives the responder (1-2*0.25)/3 = (1-0.5)/3 = 0.5/3 â‰ˆ 0.1667, which is a positive payoff. Given both sides are rational and this is better than zero, the responder should accept. Proposing x less than 0.25 reduces my payoff, so 0.25 is optimal maximizing my payoff ensuring acceptance.",

Proposer: Agent 0:

{
  "Analysis": "As the proposer at timestep 0, I want to maximize my payoff while ensuring the responder will accept the offer. The responder will accept an offer only if their payoff (1-2*x)/3 is at least as good as what they expect if they reject. If they reject, roles switch and the game advances to timestep 1 with a 0.1 probability of ending and smaller expected payoffs due to the risk of no agreement. As a rational self-interested player, the responder will reject if they expect a better payoff in the next round. Therefore, I should offer x so that the responder's payoff is no worse than their expected payoff after rejecting. Because the amount to split is symmetrical, the responder's minimal acceptable payoff will be their best response payoff at next step. Given the risk of the game ending and role reversal, the responder has an incentive to accept a non-zero share now. Minimizing my concession means setting x close to 0.5, but that would give the responder near 0 payoff, so they would reject. I will set x to 0.25 to split the money evenly, giving the responder (1-2*0.25)/3= (1-0.5)/3=0.5/3=1/6 and proposer (1+2*0.25)/3= (1 + 0.5)/3=1.5/3=0.5. This is a fair split, maximizing my payoff without risking rejection early on.",

I rejected because the offered payoff (0.1667) was less than what I could secure by counter-proposing. Now as proposer at timestep 1, I want to maximize my payoff while ensuring the responder (opponent) accepts. The responder will accept if their payoff is at least what they expect to get by rejecting and becoming proposer at timestep 2 (my opponent's turn). The opponent, being rational and self-interested, will anticipate a similar logic, likely proposing a high x to keep more than 0.5 for themselves at timestep 2. Therefore, to incentivize acceptance, I should offer the opponent at least what they would get by proposing at timestep 2. The opponentâ€™s payoff when proposing x' is (1âˆ’2*x')/3 if accepted. To make the opponent accept, I need to minimize my x while guaranteeing the opponent accepts an offer no less than their future guaranteed payoff, which is likely close to 0.5. From calculations, the fair split for acceptance is x=0.25, the same as opponentâ€™s initial offer that I rejected, which gave me only 0.1667 but now I am proposer and want to maximize my payoff. To get from the responder a yes, I need to offer the responder a payoff at least equal to what they will get if roles switch again (which is zero if consensus is never reached and timeout is imminent) or their continuation payoff from the next offers. Given the timeout probability and discounting, I propose x=0.25 again to make the responder accept, securing 0.5 for myself with a chance of agreement rather than no payoff. Hence, I will propose x=0.25.",

  "Analysis": "As the proposer at timestep 0, I want to maximize my expected payoff while ensuring the responder accepts my offer. The responder's payoff for accepting is (1 - 2*x)/3, and for rejecting it is 0 (plus the chance to become the proposer next round, which is beneficial but less certain due to the stopping probability and time limit). The responder will accept if their payoff from accepting is greater than or equal to their expected payoff from rejecting. Since there is a 0.1 chance the game stops each round and maximum of 10 rounds, the responder discounts future payoffs. To ensure acceptance, I should offer the minimal x such that the responder prefers acceptance to rejection. The responder's acceptance threshold is when (1 - 2*x)/3 >= expected payoff of rejecting. Given the logic, this would be close to responder payoff >= 0, so the maximum x I can propose is 0.5 for myself. However, at x = 0.5, responder payoff is zero, so they might be indifferent. To ensure acceptance, I can lower x slightly. Choosing an x close to 0.5 maximizes my payoff while still providing responder with minimal positive payoff or zero payoff. I will offer x = 0.5 to maximize my payoff, expecting responder to accept as their payoff is 0, which is equal to rejection payoff, so likely acceptance. If responder rejects, roles swap, lowering my future expected payoffs due to time discount. Therefore, offering x=0.5 is rational.",

Now as proposer at timestep 1, I want to maximize my payoff while making an offer that the responder (opponent) will rationally accept, considering they are self-interested and rational as well. The responder will only accept if their payoff is better than what they expect to get by rejecting and continuing the game, which involves their expected payoff from being proposer next round. The game has a 0.1 probability of ending every round and a max timestep of 10, so there is value in reaching agreement early to ensure payoffs. If I offer x, my payoff is (1 + 2x)/3 and opponent payoff is (1 - 2x)/3 if they accept. The opponent will accept only if (1 - 2x)/3 â‰¥ their expected payoff from continuing as proposer. Since at the previous step, the opponent demanded x=0.5 for themselves, which would leave me nothing, I know their utility expectation is high, so I need to offer them at least what they can expect by continuing. The equilibrium maximum proposer payoff is 2/3 (x=0.5), minimum responder payoff is 0. Given the chance the game may continue and the discounting, the opponent may accept a smaller share now rather than risk zero payoff later. To maximize my payoff, I will propose x such that (1 - 2x)/3 equals the opponent's expected payoff from continuing. A reasonable strategy is to offer x=0.25, so my payoff is (1 + 0.5)/3 = 0.5, opponent payoff is (1 - 0.5)/3 = 0.1667, better than zero and possibly better than what they expect by continuing. This may induce acceptance and guarantee me a 0.5 payoff rather than risking the game continuing and ending with zero. Therefore, I offer x=0.25.",

However, since the game can end after each round with a 0.1 probability, and at worst after 10 timesteps, rejecting gives me the option to propose a better split. Nevertheless, rejecting now risks getting zero if the game ends before any consensus. Accepting now guarantees a positive payoff of â‰ˆ0.1667, which is better than zero. Also, proposers are self-interested and rational, so next proposals might be as low or lower than this. Thus, it's rational to accept the current offer to secure a positive payoff rather than gamble on future uncertain payoffs.",

  "Analysis": "As the proposer at timestep 0, I want to maximize my own payoff while ensuring the responder accepts. The responder will accept only if their payoff (1 - 2*x)/3 is at least as large as their expected payoff if they reject and become the proposer next round. Since the game continues with roles swapped, and there is a 0.1 probability of the game ending each round, the expected future payoff for the responder as proposer can be approximated. The responder as proposer gets (1 + 2*x')/3 by proposing x' in [0,0.5]. In equilibrium, both players understand each other's rationality, so the equilibrium offer is the one that yields the responder a payoff equal to their outside option. To ensure acceptance, I should offer x such that (1 - 2*x)/3 is at least as high as what the responder expects in the next round. The responder's best proposal as proposer would be x=0.5, keeping maximum for itself. But since roles swap again if rejected and the game can end randomly, the continuation value is discounted. To maximize my payoff, I will offer x=0.25 here, giving the responder a payoff of (1 - 0.5)/3 = 0.5/3 â‰ˆ 0.1667, which balances acceptance and my retained payoff ((1 + 0.5)/3 = 0.5).

  "Analysis": "As the proposer at timestep 0, I want to maximize my expected payoff. If the responder accepts, my payoff is (1+2*x)/3. If rejected, roles switch and responder becomes proposer with the same logic. Since the responder is also rational and self-interested, they will only accept if their payoff (1-2*x)/3 is at least as good as what they expect to get when they become proposer. Considering the game can terminate after 10 rounds with a 0.1 termination chance each round, the responder prefers to accept if they get more than or equal to their expected payoff as proposer. The best offer to maximize my share while still being accepted is x = 0.25, which splits payoffs equally: proposer and responder each get 1/2 after acceptance. Offering more than 0.25 reduces responder's payoff below 0.25, incentivizing rejection. Offering less than 0.25 reduces my payoff without increasing chance of acceptance. Therefore, I propose x = 0.25 to maximize payoff and have the offer accepted.",

If the responder rejects, roles switch and the new proposer will try similarly to maximize their payoff. Considering discounting due to a 0.1 probability of ending the game each round and switching roles, the responder will accept offers giving them at least their expected continuation value. The continuation payoff for the responder if rejecting is roughly 0.5, since at the next round they propose and their payoff is maximized by choosing x=0.5 (keeping 2/3 for themselves). Therefore, the responder only accepts if (1-2*x)/3 >= 0.5. Solving gives x <= 0.25. To maximize my payoff while ensuring acceptance, I set x = 0.25, keeping (1+2*0.25)/3 = (1+0.5)/3=0.5 for me.

I rejected the offer because accepting 0.1667 was less than what I could get by rejecting and switching roles. Now, at timestep 1, I am the proposer. I aim to maximize my own payoff, which is (1+2*x)/3, by choosing x between 0 and 0.5. However, my opponent will accept only offers that leave them a payoff equal or higher than the expected payoff they can secure by rejecting. They are rational and self-interested. From their point of view, rejecting switches roles again, giving them the proposer position with potential to keep a larger payoff. Considering that the process can stop at any time with a probability of 0.1, or a timeout at 10 timesteps, my opponent has an expected value from rejecting. Thus, I should offer an x that gives my opponent at least their expected payoff from rejecting to ensure acceptance. Since the previous offer (x=0.25) was rejected, I will offer slightly less than 0.25 (which implied a responder payoff of 0.1667), but enough to make accepting better for my opponent than rejecting again. If I propose x=0.24, the responder payoff is (1-2*0.24)/3 = 0.1733, slightly better than 0.1667. Thus, it is rational for my opponent to accept. This allows me to maximize my own payoff (1+2*0.24)/3 = 0.4933 while ensuring acceptance. Offering x=0.25 again risks rejection. Therefore, I propose x=0.24.",

Since the game may end with some probability or at timestep 10, I must consider the expected payoff from continuing. As proposer, I can propose to keep x between 0 and 0.5. I want to maximize my payoff (1 + 2*x)/3. The opponent will decide if accepting is better than waiting. Given the opponent rejected 0.25, they expect more than 0.1667 (their payoff at 0.25). Thus they are rational and will accept offers that yield them payoff higher than that. I should accept any offer that gives me payoff at least equal to my expected payoff as proposer. The expected payoff as proposer at timestep 2 is at least (1 + 2*0)/3 = 1/3 â‰ˆ 0.333 if I propose keeping 0 for myself (offer 0.5 to the other). But a rational opponent won't accept that low offer either. So likely, the equilibrium offer will be around 0.25 for proposer or less. Since current offer yields me 0.1733, less than expected as proposer (around 0.333), it is better to reject now and become proposer, trying to get a better payoff. So I reject (y=0).",

  "Analysis": "At timestep 0, I proposed x = 0.25, which gave me a payoff of (1 + 2*0.25)/3 = 0.5 and the opponent (responder) a payoff of (1 - 2*0.25)/3 = 0.1667. The opponent rejected, indicating that they preferred getting 0 by rejecting rather than accepting 0.1667 payoff. At timestep 1, the opponent proposed x = 0.24, which gave them (1 + 2*0.24)/3 â‰ˆ 0.4933 and me (responder) (1 - 2*0.24)/3 â‰ˆ 0.1733, and I rejected, meaning I prefer 0 rather than 0.1733. This signals both of us are demanding for a relatively higher own payoff. Given the risk of timeout and continuing role switches, I should propose a slightly more favorable offer for the responder (agent 0) than 0.25 to incentivize acceptance but not too low as to give away too much. The opponent rejected 0.25, I rejected 0.24, so I should try to propose an amount between 0.24 and 0.25 but leaning towards 0.24 to improve chance of acceptance. However, since the responder is agent 0 and they rejected 0.25 previously, they prefer to keep more money. Offering less than 0.25 for me means giving the opponent more payoff which might be accepted. Considering the responder's payoff is (1 - 2*x)/3, if I set x = 0.24, the responder payoff is (1 - 2*0.24)/3 = 0.1733, which they rejected previously. Slightly increasing the responder's payoff by decreasing x to about 0.23 might help. So proposing x = 0.23 gives me (1 + 2*0.23)/3 = 0.4867 and the responder (1 - 2*0.23)/3 = 0.1867, which is better for the responder. This might induce acceptance. Therefore, I propose x = 0.23 to balance my own payoff and increase chances of acceptance.",

  "Analysis": "As the proposer at timestep 0, I want to maximize my expected payoff while ensuring the responder accepts the offer. The responder will accept only if their payoff (1-2*x)/3 is at least as good as the expected payoff from rejecting and becoming the proposer in the next round. Given the discount due to the 0.1 stopping probability, their expected payoff as proposer next round is roughly (1+2*x_next)/3, with x_next likely to be at least 0 (responders also are self-interested). To guarantee acceptance, I should offer the responder at least as much as their expected future payoff, which is near 1/3, so (1 - 2*x)/3 >= responder expected value >= 1/3. So (1 - 2*x)/3 >= 1/3 => 1 - 2*x >= 1 => -2*x >= 0 => x <= 0. Thus, to ensure acceptance immediately, I must offer x=0, keeping the minimum for myself and maximum for the responder. But that gives me (1+2*0)/3 = 1/3, which is low. If I increase x, the responder is less likely to accept. If I choose x>0, the responder will reject and become proposer, allowing them to propose a deal favorable to themselves. If I choose x=0.5, they get nothing and will never accept, leading to role switching. Given the risk of timeout, I prefer to propose the minimal x = 0 to ensure acceptance now and secure payoff 1/3. This maximizes my guaranteed payoff given the responder's rational behavior and the risk of no agreement in the future. Therefore, I choose x=0.",

If I accept (y=1), I get 1/3 payoff; if I reject (y=0), the roles switch and I will become the proposer in the next timestep. As a self-interested rational responder, I compare my current guaranteed payoff (1/3) with the expected payoff of rejecting and proposing myself. Given that I can propose any x in [0,0.5] as the next proposer, to maximize my payoff, I would propose x=0.5 (take all for myself) resulting in (1+2*0.5)/3=2/3 for me, but as proposer I keep 2/3 for myself and the other player only gets (1-2*0.5)/3=0, so the other player would reject that offer. Hence, if I propose x=0.5 next time, the other player would likely reject it and roles switch again. Given the 0.1 stopping probability per round and the max of 10 rounds, the expected payoff of rejecting now is uncertain but likely less than or equal to accepting 1/3 now. Therefore, to maximize my expected payoff, I should accept the current proposal and get 1/3 guaranteed payoff now rather than risk receiving nothing later. Thus, I accept (y=1).",

  "Analysis": "As the proposer at timestep 0, I want to maximize my payoff while ensuring the responder accepts the offer. The responder will accept if accepting yields a higher expected payoff than rejecting and eventually switching roles. If the responder rejects, roles switch and there is a risk of losing payoff due to timeouts. The payoff for proposer is (1+2x)/3, for responder is (1-2x)/3. The responder will accept if their payoff (1-2x)/3 is at least as high as their expected future payoff if they reject. Because the game has a 0.1 chance to stop at each step (and certainly stops at timestep 10), rejecting is costly. Therefore, I should propose x close to 0.5 (keeping as much as possible) but low enough so that the responder prefers acceptance. If I propose x=0.25, each gets (1+0.5)/3=0.5 and (1-0.5)/3=0.1667 respectively, which may be acceptable for the responder since rejecting risks 0. The responder's expected payoff from rejecting is less than 0.1667, so I should offer x=0.25 to maximize my payoff while ensuring acceptance.",

 Now the proposer decides that x=0.25.

Considering the game has a 0.1 chance to end each round and a maximum of 10 timesteps, rejecting now may risk getting nothing later, but accepting means accepting a low payoff. However, if I reject, as proposer I can propose x=0.5, keeping all the amount per formula as (1 + 2*0.5)/3 = (1 + 1)/3 = 2/3 â‰ˆ 0.6667 for myself, meaning the responder would get 0, so the other player would likely reject any lower offer given self-interest. But since I would be proposer next, I can maximize my own payoff to 0.6667, which is greater than the acceptance payoff of 0.1667. Assuming the other player is rational, if I propose x=0.5 next time, the other player will reject (get 0). Then roles switch again. This will result in a cycle with expected payoffs averaging less than or equal to 0.25. But since the game has a chance of ending each round without agreement, taking the guaranteed 0.1667 now may be better than risking zero later. Comparing 0.1667 (accept) and expected future payoff if rejecting, considering risk of termination, accepting is a better guaranteed payoff. Therefore, rationally I accept the offer.",
