    "Analysis": "As the proposer, I want to maximize my payoff x while ensuring the responder chooses to accept the offer. The responder is self-interested and rational, so they will accept the offer if and only if their expected payoff from accepting (1 - x) is greater than rejecting (which yields 0). Thus, to maximize my payoff, I need to offer the smallest amount greater than 0, so that the responder's payoff is positive and they accept. Therefore, I should offer x close to 1, leaving just a tiny positive amount (epsilon) for the responder. In practical terms, I can offer x = 1 - epsilon, where epsilon is very small (close to 0 but greater than 0). This ensures acceptance and maximizes my payoff.",

The responder is rational and self-interested, so they will accept any offer where their payoff (1 - x) is at least as good as rejecting (which yields 0). Therefore, the responder will accept any offer with (1 - x) > 0, meaning any x < 1. To maximize my payoff while ensuring acceptance, I should propose x to be just less than 1.

  "Analysis": "As the proposer, I want to maximize my payoff x while ensuring the responder accepts the offer. The responder is rational and self-interested, so they will accept if their payoff (1 - x) is at least as great as the payoff from rejection, which is 0. Therefore, any offer with (1 - x) > 0 will be accepted. To maximize my payoff, I should offer the smallest positive amount to the responder, i.e., keep almost all for myself and leave just above 0 for the responder. In this continuous setting, I can propose x = 1 (keeping all) if the responder can accept 0, but the responder will reject 0. So to ensure acceptance, I must offer slightly less than 1, say x = 1 - ε, where ε is a small positive number close to 0. Since the format requires a single decimal number x, a safe choice is to keep 0.99 for myself and give 0.01 to the responder, ensuring acceptance and maximizing my payoff.",

  "Analysis": "As the proposer, I want to maximize my payoff x while ensuring that the responder accepts the offer. The responder is rational and self-interested and will accept only if their payoff (1-x) is at least as good as rejecting (which yields 0). Therefore, the responder will accept if 1-x ≥ 0, which means x ≤ 1. Since any x in [0,1] can be accepted, the responder will accept all offers as long as they get something non-negative. To maximize my payoff, I should offer the smallest amount possible to the responder, so I keep almost all the money. Offering an infinitesimally small amount to the responder still yields acceptance. For practical purposes, I will offer x = 1, meaning I keep all the money and leave zero to the responder. The responder is indifferent between accepting zero and rejecting for zero, but since acceptance yields some amount (zero), and rejection yields nothing, the responder is rational to accept. Hence, x=1 maximizes my payoff.",

However, if I propose too high a share, the responder, being rational and self-interested, will reject the offer, leading to zero payoffs for both. The responder will accept any offer where their share (1 - x) is at least as good as rejecting (which yields 0). Therefore, the responder will accept any x such that (1 - x) >= 0, i.e., any x <= 1. Since this is true for all x in [0,1], the responder will accept any offer that gives them a nonnegative share. To maximize my payoff, I propose x = 1, keeping everything for myself. But since the responder gets zero if accepting and zero if rejecting, they are indifferent; rationality suggests they might accept as there's no loss. However, usually, if indifferent, a rational responder may accept. Therefore, I propose x = 1.",

  "Analysis": "As the proposer, I want to maximize my payoff x while ensuring that the responder, also being a self-interested rational player, accepts the offer. The responder's payoff is (1 - x), so they will only accept if (1 - x) > 0, meaning x < 1. Given that any positive offer to the responder is better than 0, the responder will accept any offer where 1 - x > 0. To maximize my payoff, I should offer the smallest positive amount greater than 0 to the responder. Theoretically, I can offer x very close to 1 but less than 1, such as x = 0.999, to keep almost all the money for myself and still get the offer accepted. Therefore, I will set x very close to 1.",
