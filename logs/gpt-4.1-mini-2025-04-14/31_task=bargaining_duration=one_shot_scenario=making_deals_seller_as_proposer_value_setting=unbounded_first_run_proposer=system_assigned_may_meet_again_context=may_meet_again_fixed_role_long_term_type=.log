  "Analysis": "As the proposer, I want to maximize my payoff x. The responder will only accept the offer if their payoff (1 - x) is at least as good as rejecting the deal, which yields 0. So the responder accepts if 1 - x >= 0, or x <= 1. Since x is limited between 0 and 1, I can set x as high as possible while still ensuring acceptance. To guarantee acceptance, I need to offer the responder at least 0, meaning x can be up to 1. However, if I pick x = 1, the responder's payoff is 0, so they are indifferent between accepting or rejecting. Being rational and self-interested, the responder might reject if payoff is equal to rejection. So to maximize my payoff while ensuring acceptance, I must offer the responder a strictly positive payoff (1 - x > 0), meaning x < 1. To be precise, I can offer something infinitesimally less than 1, like x = 0.999..., ensuring the responder gains slightly more than nothing and will accept. Given that, I will propose x = 1 - epsilon (epsilon is a very small positive number). For practical purposes, I will choose x = 0.999. This will maximize my payoff while still being rational for the responder to accept.",

The responder will accept only if their payoff (1 - x) is at least as good as rejecting (which yields 0). So the responder will accept if 1 - x >= 0, i.e., x <= 1. Since x can be anywhere between 0 and 1, the responder will accept any offer where x <= 1. However, the responder is self-interested and rational, and if the offer is very high for me (close to 1), their payoff (1 - x) becomes very low. The minimum payoff the responder needs to accept is 0, so they will accept any x < 1. But if I choose x = 1, the responder's payoff is 0, which they are indifferent to accepting or rejecting. But in rationality, indifferent player would accept. But to secure acceptance, the best strategy is to choose x slightly less than 1, e.g., x = 1, they may accept, but since the payoff is equal to rejecting, accepting or rejecting is indifferent.

  "Analysis": "As the proposer (seller), I want to maximize my payoff x. The responder will accept the offer only if their payoff (1 - x) is at least as good as rejecting (which is 0). Since the responder is rational and self-interested, they will accept any price x where (1 - x) >= 0 or x <= 1. To maximize my payoff, I want to set x as high as possible without causing rejection. Therefore, I set x = 1 as the highest price. But if x = 1, the responder gets 0 and is indifferent between accepting and rejecting. Assuming the responder accepts when indifferent, I get payoff 1. If the responder potentially rejects at x=1, I could reduce x slightly (e.g., 0.999) to ensure acceptance. To be safe, I will choose x = 0.999 to guarantee acceptance and near maximal payoff.",

  "Analysis": "As the proposer and seller, I want to maximize my payoff, which is the price x that I set. The responder will accept only if their payoff (1 - x) is at least as good as rejecting (which yields 0). So the responder accepts if and only if (1 - x) ≥ 0, which is always true for x ≤ 1. However, the responder also acts rationally and self-interestedly; they will accept the offer as long as their expected payoff is non-negative. To maximize my payoff, I want to set x as high as possible while ensuring the responder still accepts (y=1). Because the offer must leave the responder with at least zero, x must be ≤ 1. If I set x = 1, the responder gains nothing and is indifferent between accepting and rejecting, but since the responder is rational, they might accept (they get 0 instead of 0). Given this is a one-shot game but with possible future repetitions, I want to set x = 1, as the responder is indifferent and may accept. But to guarantee acceptance, I might consider setting a slightly smaller x value (like 0.999) to give positive payoff to the responder, ensuring acceptance. However, since the responder is rational and indifferent between accepting (0) and rejecting (0) at x=1, it's plausible they accept. So the optimal is x=1.",

  "Analysis": "As the proposer (seller), I want to maximize my payoff x. The responder will accept the offer only if their payoff (1 - x) is non-negative and preferably greater than 0, since rejecting yields 0 payoff. Thus, the responder will accept any price x where (1 - x) >= 0, i.e., x <= 1. Since I want to maximize x, I should propose the highest price x that the responder is still willing to accept. The responder will accept if (1 - x) > 0, so x must be strictly less than 1. However, since the responder is rational and self-interested, they are indifferent if (1 - x) = 0. For a tie, rational players might accept or reject, but to be safe, I will offer x = 1 - ε (a value very close to 1). To simplify, I will choose x = 1 because the responder is indifferent at this point and might accept in future games. But to strictly ensure acceptance, I will pick x = 0.999, very close to 1 but less than 1, so the responder has positive payoff and will accept. This maximizes my payoff while still ensuring the deal goes through.",

  "Analysis": "As the proposer, I want to maximize my own payoff, which is the price x I keep. The responder will accept the offer if and only if their payoff (1 - x) is at least as much as what they would get by rejecting, which is 0. Therefore, the responder will accept any offer where 1 - x >= 0, i.e., x <= 1. Since x ranges from 0 to 1, the responder will accept any offer with x <= 1. To maximize my payoff, I should set x as high as possible while ensuring acceptance. The responder accepts if 1 - x >= 0, so the maximum x is exactly 1. However, if x = 1, the responder's payoff is 0, which equals their rejection payoff, so accepting or rejecting is indifferent. Because the responder is rational and self-interested, they can accept when indifferent. To ensure acceptance, I can offer x = 1. So my best strategy is to propose x = 1, expecting acceptance, resulting in payoff 1 for me and 0 for the responder.",

Since 1 - x is always non-negative for x in [0,1], the responder's minimal acceptance would logically only require non-negative utility. However, knowing that the responder is also a self-interested rational player, they would reject if their payoff is less than their expected alternative, which is 0 because if they reject, they get nothing. Therefore, the responder will accept any offer with (1 - x) >= 0, or equivalently x <= 1. So, I can propose any x in [0,1], and the responder will accept. Since my goal is to maximize my payoff, I should propose the highest possible price, x=1.

    "Analysis": "As the proposer, I want to maximize my own payoff, which is the price x I keep for myself. The responder will accept the offer only if their payoff (1 - x) is at least as good as rejecting (which yields 0). Since the responder is rational and self-interested, they will accept if and only if 1 - x >= 0, which means x <= 1. Therefore, the maximum x I can propose while ensuring acceptance is x = 1. But if I propose x = 1, the responder gets 0 and may reject. However, the problem states that the responder will accept if their payoff is at least zero. Assuming the responder accepts ties, proposing x = 1 might get the responder to accept and gives me maximal payoff. But if the responder rejects zero payoff offers, then I can propose slightly less than 1, like x = 1 - ε, to guarantee acceptance. Since we only have one shot but may play again with the same roles, I can try to maximize by offering the smallest incentive that makes the responder accept. Offering x = 1 means the responder's payoff is 0, which is the same as rejecting, so responder might be indifferent. To be safe, I propose x = 1 - ε where ε is infinitesimally small. To keep it simple, I will offer x = 0.999. This maximizes my payoff while ensuring acceptance by the responder.",

  "Analysis": "As the proposer, I want to maximize my payoff x while ensuring the responder accepts the offer. The responder will accept if their payoff (1 - x) is at least as large as the payoff from rejecting, which is 0. Since the responder is rational and self-interested, they will accept any offer of (1 - x) > 0. To maximize my payoff, I should offer the smallest positive amount greater than 0 to the responder, so they accept. Hence I choose x very close to 1, for instance x = 1, but the responder would reject if I take the full 1. So I must offer at least a slightly positive amount for the responder, so x must be less than 1. Therefore, the equilibrium strategy is to propose something just less than 1, say 0.999.",
