  "Analysis": "As the proposer, I want to maximize my own payoff x. The responder is rational and self-interested, and will accept any offer if their payoff (1 - x) is at least as good as rejecting (which gives 0). Therefore, the responder will accept any offer where 1 - x >= 0, or x <= 1. To maximize my payoff, I should offer the smallest possible amount that the responder will accept, which means I keep almost all 1 for myself and leave the smallest positive amount to the responder. Since the responder accepts any offer where their payoff is non-negative, I can set x very close to 1 (e.g., x = 1) and the responder will accept since 1 - 1 = 0. So, I will keep x = 1, leaving 0 for the responder, which is still accepted because the responder is indifferent between 0 payoff and rejection payoff 0. Hence, my expected payoff is maximized at 1.",

Since both players are self-interested and rational, the responder will accept if and only if 1 - x > 0, i.e., x < 1. Given this, I can offer the smallest positive amount for the responder to accept, keeping almost the entire amount for myself. The minimal positive amount can be arbitrarily close to 0, but we must choose an actual number within [0,1]. Thus, I should choose x slightly less than 1, for example, x = 0.999.

    "Analysis": "As the proposer, I want to maximize my own payoff x, while ensuring the responder accepts the offer. The responder will only accept if their payoff (1-x) is greater than 0, because rejecting yields 0. Since the responder is rational and self-interested, they will accept any offer where (1-x) > 0, i.e., x < 1. Offering x = 1 (keeping everything) results in 0 payoff for the responder, who will reject. Therefore, the best strategy is to propose the smallest positive amount for the responder to accept, i.e., make x as close to 1 as possible but less than 1. For concreteness and clarity, I will propose x = 0.9999, leaving 0.0001 for the responder. This maximizes my payoff while yielding a minimal positive reward to the responder so they accept.",

Because x must be between 0 and 1 inclusive, I can choose x = 1 - ε, where ε is arbitrarily small.

  "Analysis": "As the proposer, I want to maximize the amount I keep, which is x, while ensuring that the responder accepts the offer. The responder will accept if their payoff (1 - x) is at least as good as rejecting (which gives 0). Since the responder is rational and self-interested, they will accept any offer with (1 - x) >= 0, i.e., any x <= 1. To maximize my payoff, I want to minimize the amount left to the responder, so I will set x as close as possible to 1 (keeping almost all for myself), knowing that the responder will still accept any positive payoff. Therefore, the optimal proposal is to keep x = 1 for myself and give 0 to the responder, who will accept since 0 is their baseline payoff for rejection. However, since a payoff of zero might make the responder indifferent and accepting or rejecting both result in zero payoff, the responder being rational can accept to avoid rejecting nothing. In conclusion, setting x=1 gives me the highest payoff with no incentive for the responder to reject.",

  "Analysis": "As a self-interested rational proposer, I want to maximize my own payoff x while ensuring that the responder accepts the offer. The responder will accept the offer if their payoff (1 - x) is at least as good as rejecting, which is 0. Since the responder is rational and self-interested, they will accept any positive amount of payoff. Therefore, I can maximize my payoff by offering the smallest positive amount to the responder and keep the rest. Hence, I choose x close to 1, leaving the responder with an epsilon > 0. For simplicity, I choose x = 1, meaning I keep everything and the responder gets 0. However, if the responder rejects at 0, then I get 0 anyway. To guarantee acceptance, I need to offer a tiny amount to the responder. Therefore, I pick x = 0.999999 (nearly 1) to ensure acceptance and maximize my payoff.",
