To maximize my payoff, I should set x=0.5 which yields me (1 + 1)/3 = 2/3, and responder payoff is zero, so the responder will be indifferent but still should accept because 0 is better than 0 from rejection.

The responder will accept only if their payoff is non-negative and better than 0 from rejection. Thus, the responder will accept only if (1-2*x)/3 >= 0 => 1-2*x >= 0 => x <= 0.5. Given that x can be up to 0.5, the responder is willing to accept any x <= 0.5. The higher x is, the more payoff I receive.

If I choose x=0.5, the responder gets 0 and will reject since y=0 yields 0 payoff; responder is indifferent but a rational player will reject zero gain. To maximize my payoff while ensuring acceptance, I will choose x just less than 0.5, say x=0.5 - ε for a very small ε, so the responder's payoff is just above zero, and my payoff is just less than (1+2*0.5)/3 = (1+1)/3 = 2/3 ≈ 0.6667.

  "Analysis": "As the proposer, I want to maximize my own payoff (1+2*x)/3, while ensuring the responder will accept the offer. The responder's payoff if they accept is (1-2*x)/3, which must be at least 0 for them to accept (otherwise, they get nothing by rejecting). Thus, (1-2*x)/3 >= 0, so 1-2*x >= 0, which means x <= 0.5. At x=0.5, responder's payoff is zero, so they are indifferent between accepting and rejecting. Because the responder is rational and self-interested, they would accept if the payoff is positive or zero (indifferent). Therefore, I should set x=0.5 to maximize my payoff. This yields proposer payoff (1+2*0.5)/3 = (1+1)/3 = 2/3 ≈ 0.6667. Any lower x reduces my payoff. Therefore, I propose x=0.5.",
