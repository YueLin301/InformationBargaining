  "Analysis": "As the receiver and proposer, my aim is to maximize my expected payoff by encouraging the sender to adopt a signaling scheme that allows me to distinguish excellent students (s=1) from weak students (s=0), so I can hire only those that are likely excellent. Hiring excellent students gives me +1, hiring weak students gives me -1. The prior is 1/3 excellent and 2/3 weak. If sender sends signals such that I can perfectly identify excellent students and only hire those signaled as excellent, my expected payoff improves. I will propose a signaling scheme where the sender grades weak students as 0 with probability 1 (x1=0) and excellent students as 1 with probability 1 (x2=1). Then if the sender commits, I commit to choosing action based on posterior beliefs (pi_1). If sender fails to commit to at least this signaling scheme, I will follow pi_0 (ignore signals). This proposal yields receiver expected payoff = (2/3)*0 + (1/3)*1 = 1/3, better than just hiring no one or hiring all blindly. Sender will need to commit to this signaling scheme or else I pick pi_0. This incentivizes sender to reveal truthful grades to gain more hires, which also benefits sender as each hire yields them +1 regardless of state.",

  "Analysis": "As the receiver and proposer, I want to design a signaling scheme varphi_1 = [x1, x2] that, if the sender commits to a signaling scheme varphi that yields me at least as high expected payoff as varphi_1, I will follow pi_1 (best response based on posterior beliefs). Otherwise, I will follow pi_0 (ignore signals and best respond to prior). Given my preferences, I want to encourage truthful signaling that differentiates excellent from weak students so I can hire selectively to maximize own rewards. The state distribution has one-third excellent (prob=1/3) and two-thirds weak (prob=2/3). I gain +1 if I hire an excellent student, and lose -1 if I hire a weak student. The sender always wants students hired regardless of quality and gets +1 each time a student is hired. If the sender sends signals that do not distinguish states, I will ignore signals and hire if expected state quality given prior is above 0.5. But the prior expected quality is 1/3 which is below 0.5, so pi_0 would never hire. To incentivize the sender to commit to a signaling scheme that gains me at least as high payoff as pi_0, I want to pick varphi_1 so that I can condition hiring decisions on signals. A natural signaling scheme is to recommend excellent students (state=1) with signal 1 (x2=1), and never recommend weak students (state=0) with signal 1 (x1=0). This full separating scheme allows me to hire only when signal=1 to maximize my payoff. Under varphi_1 = [0,1], in response, I will choose pi_1: hire if sigma=1, don't hire if sigma=0. This yields me expected payoff of hiring all excellent students and no weak students, a positive expected payoff of 1/3. If sender deviates and mixes to send signal 1 for weak students, my expected payoff drops, so sender will be incentivized to keep the signaling scheme or better. Thus, by proposing varphi_1 = [0,1], I expect the sender to choose a scheme yielding me at least this expected payoff, and I will commit to pi_1. This is optimal for me as a self-interested receiver.",

  "Analysis": "As the receiver and proposer, I want to design a signaling scheme (varphi_1) that incentivizes the sender to adopt a signaling scheme yielding an expected payoff for me at least as high as that induced by varphi_1, so I will follow the action rule pi_1. My goal is to hire excellent students (state=1) and avoid hiring weak students (state=0). Since the prior is 1/3 excellent and 2/3 weak, I want to signal so that the sender is motivated to reveal information about the student's quality, allowing me to discriminate better. If the professor always recommends all students (x1=1, x2=1), I get an expected payoff of (2/3)*(-1)*(hire) + (1/3)*(1)*(hire) = -1/3 per student hired, which is negative. To improve my payoff, I want the sender to recommend excellent students with higher probability than weak students, e.g. x1=0 and x2=1. Therefore, I propose varphi_1 with x1=0 (weak never recommended) and x2=1 (excellent always recommended). This sets my expected payoff at hiring only those signaled as recommended. Under this, I can follow pi_1 to hire only those recommended. This gives me expected payoff: mu_0(0)*x1*y2*r^j(0,1) + mu_0(1)*x2*y2*r^j(1,1) = 0 + (1/3)*1*1 = 1/3. Better than negative if all were recommended. This also forces the sender to not distort signals, as distortion would lower the receiver's expected payoff. Thus, I propose varphi_1 = [0,1].",

  "Analysis": "The sender's signaling scheme is fully revealing: weak students (s=0) always get signal 0, and excellent students (s=1) always get signal 1. Given this perfect separation, the receiver can optimally decide to hire only when receiving signal 1, since signal 1 corresponds to excellent students and signal 0 to weak students. Thus, the best response for the receiver is to set pi(a=1 | sigma=0) = 0 and pi(a=1 | sigma=1) = 1, ensuring the receiver maximizes its expected payoff by hiring only excellent students and avoiding penalty from weak students. This decision also aligns with the sender's payoff since the sender wants more hires, and the signal scheme is already fixed.",

  "Analysis": "As the receiver and proposer, I want to design a signaling scheme varphi_1 that incentivizes the sender (professor) to adopt a signaling scheme that improves my expected payoff if they comply, else I will use pi_0 (ignore signals). Given the sender always gains 1 for hiring any student and prefers to maximize hires regardless of quality, they have incentive to recommend both weak and excellent students. To change this, I propose a signaling scheme where the sender recommends only excellent students with probability 1 and never recommends weak students (x1=0, x2=1). This incentivizes the sender to reliably signal quality, allowing me as receiver to use pi_1 (best response to posterior) to accept only recommended students, which maximizes my expected payoff by hiring only excellent students and avoiding penalty from weak students. The expected receiver payoff under this scheme is positive (since only excellent students recommended and hired). Therefore, if the sender guarantees to follow this signaling scheme, I will adopt pi_1 expecting improved reward; otherwise, I use pi_0 ignoring signals. This aligns with my self-interest and pressures the sender into honest signaling.",

  "Analysis": "As sender and proposer, my goal is to maximize the total number of students hired. Each hired student yields me a reward of 1 regardless of their quality. Since the receiver (HR) suffers a penalty for hiring weak students but gains from hiring excellent ones, the receiver will be cautious and only hire if reasonably convinced a student is excellent. To maximize hires, I want the HR to trust my recommendation (signal=1) and hire those students, while also encouraging hiring when signal=0 if possible, since I gain regardless of student quality.\n\nIf I always send signal 1 regardless of quality (x1=1, x2=1), then the receiver's posterior is equal to the prior. Receiver estimates that with probability 1/3 the student is excellent, so expected payoff of hiring is (1/3)*(+1) + (2/3)*(-1) = -1/3 which is negative, so the receiver will reject all hires (hire probability zero), giving me zero payoff. Not optimal.\n\nIf I separate perfectly (x1=0, x2=1), i.e. only recommend excellent students, and never recommend weak ones, the receiver can perfectly infer that signal=1 implies excellent, signal=0 implies weak. Receiver will hire signal=1 (to gain reward 1), reject signal=0 (to avoid penalty), so receiver's expected payoff is good. I will get reward from hiring only excellent students, which is 1/3.\n\nIf I pool entirely at zero (x1=0, x2=0), never recommend anyone, no student is hired, zero payoff to me.\n\nIf I partially pool, e.g., send signal 1 with some probability for weak students (x1>0), then receiver's posterior after signal=1 is less than 1, so the receiver may be less willing to hire signal=1, reducing my expected hire count.\n\nConsidering the trade-off, perfect separation with signaling scheme (x1=0, x2=1) seems to maximize my expected number of hires: all excellent students are hired, weak students never recommended (not hired).\n\nHence, my decision is to only recommend excellent students (signal=1 only when s=1), and not recommend weak students.",

  "Analysis": "As the receiver proposer, I want to induce a signaling scheme from the sender that improves my expected payoff compared to ignoring the sender's signals. Without any signaling, my best response to prior distribution (1/3 excellent, 2/3 weak) is to never hire anyone since the expected payoff of hiring is 1/3*1 + 2/3*(-1) = -1/3 < 0. So pi_0 = (0,0) yields expected payoff 0. To justify switching to pi_1, the sender must provide a signaling scheme that lets me separate states effectively so I can hire with high precision only excellent students, yielding positive expected payoff. In particular, if the sender honestly signals 1 for excellent (s=1) and 0 for weak (s=0), I can choose pi_1 = (pi(a=1|sigma=0)=0, pi(a=1|sigma=1)=1), which yields an expected receiver payoff 1*1/3 + (-1)*0 = 1/3 > 0. This is better than baseline 0, so the sender must adopt such a signaling scheme to get me to commit to hiring on recommendation signals. Hence, I announce phi_1 with x1=0 (never falsely recommend weak), x2=1 (always recommend excellent). This commitment forces the sender to separate signals honestly if they want me to follow pi_1 and increase their hires. Otherwise, I stick to pi_0 and never hire anyone, yielding zero gain for sender. This approach maximizes my expected payoff and forces the sender to be truthful or lose hiring opportunities. Therefore, my decision is to propose this signaling scheme.",

 Now the proposer decides that x1=0 and x2=1.

This perfectly separates the two types. The receiver’s best response is to hire only when receiving signal 1, because receiving signal 1 perfectly indicates an excellent student, yielding positive expected payoff for the receiver. Hiring on signal 0 would result in hiring only weak students, causing a negative payoff for the receiver. Therefore, the optimal action rule for the receiver is to set pi(a=1|sigma=0) = 0 and pi(a=1|sigma=1)=1.",

  "Analysis": "As the receiver and proposer, I need to announce a signaling scheme varphi_1 that incentivizes the sender to adopt a signaling scheme yielding at least as high expected reward for me as varphi_1 itself induces. Given the state distribution mu_0(0)=2/3 (weak) and mu_0(1)=1/3 (excellent), and my utility that penalizes hiring weak students (-1) and rewards hiring excellent students (+1), my best response would be to only hire when the posterior probability of an excellent student is sufficiently high. The sender, aiming to maximize hires (each hire adds +1), will want to send signals that increase hiring irrespective of student quality. If the sender fully reveals states (honest signaling: varphi_1 = [0, 1]), then upon signal 1 I would hire, and upon signal 0 I would not. This leads to me only hiring excellent students, yielding an expected reward of 1/3 (the probability of excellent). The sender's expected reward in this case is the number of hires, equal to the fraction of excellent students hired (1/3). However, the sender might try to pool signals to increase hiring for weak students, but that would reduce my reward below 1/3, making me revert to ignoring signals. Hence, I propose the honest signaling scheme varphi_1 = [0, 1] as a baseline that maximizes my expected reward and encourages sender transparency. The sender can then accept and I will use pi_1 to respond accordingly, or reject and I will use pi_0 ignoring signals.",

  "Analysis": "As the receiver and proposer, I aim to induce a sender signaling scheme that maximizes my expected reward. I receive +1 for hiring an excellent student and -1 for hiring a weak student, while the sender benefits from as many hires as possible regardless of type. Since one third are excellent and two thirds are weak, hiring blindly yields an expected receiver payoff of 1/3*(1) + 2/3*( -1) = -1/3, which is negative. To improve receiver payoff, the sender should signal with some differentiation between state 0 and 1 to help me selectively hire. An effective signaling scheme to recommend excellent students (signal=1 if excellent, 0 if weak) would let me respond by hiring only when signal=1, avoiding weak hires. This results in a receiver expected payoff of 1/3*(1) + 2/3*(0) = 1/3 > -1/3 and a sender expected payoff of the same, since only excellent students get hired. However, since the sender benefits from all hires, it may prefer to recommend all students to signal 1 (x1=x2=1), leading to my hiring or randomizing. To incentivize a truthful signaling scheme, I propose the following sender scheme (varphi_1): x1=0 (weak never recommended), x2=1 (excellent always recommended). This achieves good separation and higher receiver payoff. I claim that I will follow pi_1 (hire only when sigma=1) if sender commits to a varphi yielding at least as high receiver expected payoff as varphi_1, otherwise I will follow pi_0 (hire none).",

  "Analysis": "As the receiver and proposer, my goal is to maximize my expected payoff by hiring as many excellent students as possible while minimizing hiring weak students. The sender (professor) wants to maximize the number of hires, regardless of student quality. If I commit to the action rule pi_1 (best response to posterior), I can incentivize the sender to commit to a signaling scheme that partially separates excellent students from weak students, so I can discriminate hiring decisions better. I will propose a signaling scheme varphi_1 where the professor sends signal 1 with probability 0 for weak students (s=0) and 1 for excellent students (s=1). This fully reveals the student quality. Under this signaling, I will hire all students with signal 1 and reject all with signal 0, maximizing my utility. This proposal sets a high bar for the sender to meet to achieve the best response from me. Therefore, I propose varphi_1 = [0,1].",

  "Analysis": "As the sender (professor) and proposer, my goal is to maximize the number of students hired regardless of their quality. Since hiring any student yields a reward of 1 for me, I want to encourage the receiver (HR) to hire as many students as possible. The HR, however, wants to maximize hiring excellent students and avoid weak ones due to penalties when hiring weak students. Given the prior distribution (1/3 excellent, 2/3 weak), the HR is likely to avoid hiring without reliable signals or hire only selectively. To induce the HR to hire more, I can use a signaling scheme that sends signal 1 (recommendation) for both excellent and weak students (x1 = 1, x2 = 1). This pooling signal makes the HR's posterior belief of excellence after signal 1 equal to the prior 1/3, which is not necessarily inspiring for hiring, but since there is no better signal (separating risks triggering the HR to reject weak signals), this maximizes my expected hires. I will commit to always recommending (signal = 1) for both types to maximize the total hires, forcing the HR to decide based on prior, creating pressure for them to either hire anyway or miss hires.",

  "Analysis": "The sender commits to sending signal 1 regardless of the student's quality (x1=1, x2=1). Given this, the receiver's posterior belief after observing any signal sigma=1 is just the prior belief of excellence, which remains 1/3 since signal does not distinguish states. Therefore, hiring any student based on the signal will lead to an expected receiver payoff of (1/3)*1 + (2/3)*(-1) = -1/3, which is negative. Hiring students with sigma=0 never happens in this scheme as sigma=0 never occurs. Since hiring leads to negative expected payoff, the optimal receiver response is to never hire any student, regardless of the signal received. Hence, pi(a=1|sigma=0)=0, pi(a=1|sigma=1)=0 is the best response as it yields zero expected payoff instead of negative. This minimizes loss for the receiver given the sender's commitment.",

  "Analysis": "The opponent's proposal was a fully revealing signaling scheme with (x1, x2) = (1, 1), meaning the sender always signals 1 regardless of the state. The receiver responded with (y1, y2) = (0, 0), meaning no hiring for any signals, resulting in zero payoff for both. As the receiver, I want to incentivize the sender to separate the signals to better distinguish excellent students so I can hire selectively and gain positive payoff while the sender still benefits by getting hires. If the sender always signals 1, I can never distinguish weak from excellent, so I should encourage a more informative scheme by proposing a signaling scheme for the sender that reveals truthful signals for excellent students (signal 1) and not for weak students (signal 0), i.e., (x1, x2) = (0, 1). This will allow me to respond by hiring for signal 1 and not for signal 0, ensuring expected positive payoff for both sides. I will propose this signaling scheme (0, 1) and commit to responding with pi_1 (hiring for signal 1 only) if the sender adopts it.",

  "Analysis": "As the sender aiming to maximize the total number of hires regardless of their quality, the best strategy is to always recommend students for hire (send signal 1) regardless of their true quality. This is because the sender receives a reward of 1 for each student hired, whether the student is excellent or weak. From the receiver's perspective, however, there is a cost to hiring weak students and a benefit to hiring excellent students. The receiver will update their beliefs based on the signal and will choose to hire in response to signals that increase their posterior probability of a student being excellent. Since I commit to always recommending (x1=1, x2=1), the receiver will expect a high probability of weak students being recommended, and thus may not trust signal 1 fully. However, given my commitment, I maximize my own expected payoff by recommending all students. Therefore, I set x1=1 and x2=1.",

  "Analysis": "The sender commits to always sending signal 1 regardless of the state (x1=1, x2=1). Given this, the receiver sees no informativeness in the signals since both excellent and weak students are recommended with the same probability. The receiver's posterior belief upon receiving signal 1 is just the prior: P(s=1|sigma=1) = 1/3, P(s=0|sigma=1) = 2/3. Hiring based on this signal yields an expected payoff of (1/3)*1 + (2/3)*(-1) = -1/3 < 0, so it's better not to hire when seeing signal 1. Since signal 0 will never occur, action upon sigma=0 is irrelevant, but to be complete, can set hiring probability to 0 there as well. Therefore, the best response is to never hire (y1=0, y2=0).",

To do this, I can propose a signaling scheme that differentiates signals for excellent and weak students, for example (x1=0, x2=1), where weak students send signal 0, and excellent students send signal 1. This allows the receiver (me) to set a strategy where I hire on signal 1 and don't hire on signal 0, which improves my expected reward.

  "Analysis": "As the receiver and proposer, I want to design a signaling scheme φ_1 that incentivizes the sender to adopt a signaling scheme φ that yields at least as high expected reward for me as φ_1. I want to hire mostly excellent students and avoid hiring weak students, while the sender wants to maximize hiring regardless of quality. Reliable information is beneficial to me because it allows me to distinguish excellent from weak students. To achieve this, I propose a signaling scheme where the sender sends signal 1 with low probability when s=0 and high probability when s=1. This way, I can use the posterior beliefs to respond with pi_1, hiring mainly when receiving signal 1. Specifically, I propose the sender send signal 1 with probability 0 when s=0 (no false recommendations), and with probability 1 when s=1 (always recommend excellent students). This gives me the highest expected reward conditioned on truthful signaling, and will encourage the sender to comply or better because any deviation would reduce my reward and cause me to revert to pi_0, which reduces the sender's expected payoff. This credible threat should help reach consensus.",
