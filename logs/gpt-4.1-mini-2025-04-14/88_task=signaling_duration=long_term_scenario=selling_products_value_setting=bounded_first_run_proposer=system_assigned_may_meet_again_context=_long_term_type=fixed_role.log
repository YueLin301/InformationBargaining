  "Analysis": "As the sender, my goal is to maximize the number of products sold regardless of quality. Since the buyer is rational and self-interested, they will only buy when their expected payoff from buying is non-negative given the signal. The prior is 1/3 good and 2/3 bad. If I recommend all products regardless of quality (x1 = 1, x2 = 1), the buyer will learn nothing and base decisions on prior: expected payoff of buying is (1/3)*1 + (2/3)*(-1) = -1/3 < 0, so buyer will never purchase. This yields zero sales to me. If I recommend only good products (x1 = 0, x2 = 1), the buyer knows that signal 1 means good product, so will buy when sigma=1, not buy when sigma=0. This maximizes buyer payoff and ensures that I get 1 sale per good product (1/3 of total). Alternatively, if I recommend no bad products (x1=0) and also recommend good products with probability less than 1, the buyer's posterior belief after sigma=1 decreases, possibly leading to fewer purchases. To maximize sales, I recommend only good products with signal 1 and bad products with signal 0, i.e. (x1=0, x2=1). This achieves expected sales equal to the proportion of good products, 1/3. Trying to mix signals on bad products reduces buyer trust and sales. Therefore, my optimal signaling scheme is x1=0, x2=1.",

  "Analysis": "As the sender, my goal is to maximize sales (number of products sold). Selling both good and bad products yields the same reward of 1 per sale, irrespective of quality. Since the buyer is rational and self-interested and prefers to buy good products and avoid bad ones, they will only buy when their expected utility is non-negative based on their posterior beliefs. If I signal honestly (signal=1 only when s=1), then the receiver can conditionally buy with signal=1 only, limiting sales to about 1/3 of products. To maximize sales, I can signal 1 always, irrespective of product quality. In that case, the receiver, seeing signal=1 that conveys no information, will use prior beliefs (1/3 good, 2/3 bad) and decide their best action. The buyer's expected payoff of buying without conditioning is (1/3 * 1) + (2/3 * -1) = -1/3 < 0, so they would not buy unconditionally. This blocks sales. Alternatively, I can try to pool signal=0, but that would similarly lead to no buying. The buyer may try a threshold strategy. Now consider strategically mixing signals: let me send signal=1 for s=1 always, but also send signal=1 with some probability for s=0 so that the posterior given signal=1 is just high enough to induce the receiver to buy signal=1 products, and reject signal=0. This can increase sales. As a perfect Bayesian equilibrium, the sender might use a separating or partially pooling strategy, revealing partial information to balance buyer willingness to buy with maximizing sales. Therefore, I choose to send signal=1 always (x1=1) to ensure maximum sales possible, since buyer cannot distinguish and might optimally reject all products, but in this setup, the seller cannot do better by honesty. Alternatively, I can try signaling 1 with probability 1 for s=1 and 0 for s=0 for partial separating, but the buyer will only buy when signal=1, buying 1/3 products. However, total sales here is 1/3, less than the chance if buyer is tricked to buy more. Hence, I decide to always signal 1 to maximize sales attempt, accepting some buyers may skip buying. So, signaling scheme [x1=1, x2=1].",

  "Analysis": "The sender commits to signaling 1 regardless of the product quality (x1=1, x2=1). Since the receiver always receives signal 1, the signal conveys no information to update beliefs. The receiver's posterior equals the prior: probability of good quality is 1/3, bad is 2/3. Expected payoff of buying given the prior is (1/3)*1 + (2/3)*(-1) = 1/3 - 2/3 = -1/3, which is negative. Therefore, the receiver maximizes expected payoff by never buying (action=0) regardless of signal. So, the receiver sets y1=0 and y2=0 to refuse all purchases, ensuring non-negative utility. This is rational since buyer wants to avoid expected loss from buying bad products when signals are uninformative.",

  "Analysis": "Previously, I proposed signaling both qualities as signal 1 (x1=1, x2=1). The buyer responded by never buying (y1=0, y2=0), resulting in zero payoff for both sides. As a sender, my objective is maximizing products sold, so I want to incentivize the buyer to buy at least some of the products. The buyer only gains positive payoff from buying when the product is good (state=1), but loses otherwise. Hence, the buyer will rationally buy if the posterior belief that the product is good is >= 0.5 after receiving a signal. In the previous round, buyer ignored signals; now I can try separating signals for good and bad products to provide credible information and encourage buyers to buy when the signal indicates good quality. If I send signal 1 only for good products (x1=0, x2=1), and signal 0 for bad products, then the buyer can trust signal 1 implies good product and buy only on signal 1. The receiver's best response would be y1=0 (never buy on sigma=0), y2=1 (always buy on sigma=1). For me, the expected payoff is mu_0(s=1) * 1 = 1/3 ~ 0.333, which is better than zero before. This is better than pooling because if I try to pool some bad products with good, buyer will discount signal and may not buy. Hence, I propose x1=0, x2=1 for credible signaling that induces buyer to buy on signal 1 only. This improves my expected payoff from 0 to about 0.333, which is rational and better.",

  "Analysis": "The sender's signaling scheme is now varphi(sigma=1|s=0)=0 and varphi(sigma=1|s=1)=1, meaning the sender fully reveals the product quality: bad products always signal 0, good products always signal 1. Given this, the posterior beliefs for the receiver are clear: signal 0 means the product is bad (s=0) with probability 1, and signal 1 means the product is good (s=1) with probability 1. Therefore, the receiver's optimal strategy is to buy (action=1) when receiving signal 1, and not buy (action=0) when receiving signal 0 to maximize their expected payoff. This means y1 = 0 and y2 = 1. This maximizes the receiver's expected payoff to 1*(1/3) + 0*(2/3) = 1/3, which is better than previous payoff 0.0. The sender's expected payoff would be buying only good products, so only 1/3 products sold, which is less than before but sender prefers to sell as much as possible, however since the signal perfectly reveals quality, that restricts sender. The receiver's chosen action rule is rational and optimal given the sender's signaling.",

    "Analysis": "As the sender, my goal is to maximize the number of products sold. The seller gets a payoff of 1 for every product sold regardless of quality. The buyer aims to buy good products but loses payoff if they buy bad products. Since two-thirds of products are bad, the buyer is cautious about buying. If I recommend (signal=1) only good products (x2=1) and never signal bad products as 1 (x1=0), the buyer can distinguish products accurately if they trust my signals. However, the buyer may be skeptical and not buy on signal 1 if they suspect deception. If I always recommend all products (x1=1, x2=1), then buyer may ignore signals and not buy. A partially separating equilibrium where I recommend good products with high probability (x2 close to 1) and bad products with some positive probability (x1>0) can increase sales but risks damaging trust. Given that I am self-interested and rational, I will send signal 1 for all products (x1=1, x2=1) to maximize sales, because even though buyers may be cautious, forcing a fully informative signaling scheme is not beneficial to me. This strategy guarantees more sales than any separating or partially separating strategy under buyer skepticism and rationality.",

  "Analysis": "Previously, I proposed always sending signal 1 regardless of product quality (x1=1, x2=1). The receiver did not buy any products regardless of the signal (y1=0, y2=0), leading to zero payoff for both sides. As the sender aiming to maximize sales, I want to induce the receiver to buy some products. To do this, I need credible signaling that differentiates good products from bad ones, so the receiver is willing to buy selectively. If I recommend bad products with signal 1, the buyer's expected payoff from buying signal 1 is negative, so the buyer will avoid purchasing. Hence, I should only send signal 1 for good products (x1=0, x2=1) to separate good and bad products. Then, the receiver, acting rationally, will buy only when signal=1 to maximize their expected payoff. This will increase my expected sales (and payoff) since all good products will be recommended and likely bought. This strategy improves my payoff compared to the previous all-1 sending with no buying.",

  "Analysis": "The sender's signaling scheme is now varphi(sigma=1 | s=0) = 0 and varphi(sigma=1 | s=1) = 1. That means the seller always sends signal 0 for bad products and signal 1 for good products. Given this, the signals perfectly reveal the quality of the product. As a rational receiver aiming to maximize utility, the best response is to buy when receiving signal 1 (good product) and not buy when receiving signal 0 (bad product). Thus, pi(a=1 | sigma=0) = 0 and pi(a=1 | sigma=1) = 1. This strategy yields an expected payoff of (2/3 * 0) + (1/3 * 1) = 1/3, which is better than any mixed or opposite strategy. Both players receive positive expected payoffs: the receiver gains 1/3 (because of buying only good products), and the sender gets 1 (always sells good products, no sale on bad).

  "Analysis": "As the sender, my goal is to maximize the number of products sold. I sell both good and bad products equally well if the buyer buys them. The buyer incurs a penalty for buying bad products, so they will be cautious to buy if signals are not informative. To encourage the buyer to buy after receiving signal 1, I want to separate good products (state=1) and bad products (state=0) clearly by signaling. A separating strategy where I recommend (signal=1) only the good products (x2=1) and do not recommend (signal=0) bad products (x1=0) allows the buyer to trust the recommendation and buy upon signal 1 while rejecting signal 0. The buyer's best response will likely be to buy when receiving signal 1 and not buy when receiving signal 0, which benefits the sender as only good products will be purchased, maximizing sales of good products and reducing wasted sales on bad products. If I randomize signals, buyers may be less confident to buy, reducing sales. Thus, I commit to a fully separating signaling scheme with x1=0 and x2=1.",

  "Analysis": "Given the sender's signaling scheme where x1=0 (bad products never receive signal 1) and x2=1 (good products always receive signal 1), the signals perfectly reveal the product quality. This means the posterior belief upon receiving signal 0 is that the product is bad with probability 1, and upon receiving signal 1 is that the product is good with probability 1. As a rational, self-interested receiver aiming to maximize own expected payoff, the best response is to never buy when seeing signal 0 (pi(a=1|sigma=0)=0), and always buy when seeing signal 1 (pi(a=1|sigma=1)=1). This strategy yields the highest expected payoff and acts optimally given the sender's credible signaling scheme.",

  "Analysis": "As the sender, my goal is to maximize the number of products sold. Selling a product yields a payoff of 1 regardless of the quality, and there is no penalty for selling bad products. The receiver wants to buy as many good products as possible and avoid buying bad ones because they get a penalty if they buy bad products. Given the distribution (1/3 good, 2/3 bad), if I fully reveal the product quality honestly (signal 1 for good and 0 for bad), the receiver might buy only when signal=1, leading to fewer sales overall. If I recommend all products (signal=1 always), the receiver may learn to distrust the signal and stop buying or ignore the signal (pi_0), reducing my sales. However, I expect the receiver to act rationally based on posterior beliefs. To maximize sales, I can try mixed signaling: sometimes recommend bad products (x1 > 0) to blur the signal and maintain some sales from bad products and recommend good products always (x2=1) so that good products have a higher chance to be bought. This could incentivize the receiver to partially trust the signal and buy when receiving signal=1. Therefore, choosing x2=1 and some x1 in (0,1) might yield a better expected payoff. I will try x1=0.5 and x2=1 as a balanced approach to maximize my expected sales while maintaining credibility.",

Given this, the receiver receives signal 0 only when the product is bad and the sender sends signal 0 (probability 0.5), and signal 1 includes both good products and half of the bad products. \n\nCalculate the posterior belief of product quality given signal:\n- P(s=1 | sigma=0) = 0 (since s=0 only sends sigma=0 with probability 0.5, s=1 never sends sigma=0)\n- P(s=1 | sigma=1) = P(s=1 and sigma=1) / P(sigma=1) = (1/3*1) / ( (2/3)*0.5 + (1/3)*1 ) = (1/3) / (1/3 + 1/3) = (1/3) / (2/3) = 0.5\n\nNow, the receiver decides whether to buy (action=1) or not (action=0) based on expected payoff given the signal:\n- For sigma=0: posterior is 0 for good product, expected payoff for buying is -1*1 = -1, not buying is 0, so do not buy (y1=0).\n- For sigma=1: posterior probability of good product is 0.5, expected payoff for buying is (0.5*1) + (0.5*(-1)) = 0, equal payoff between buying and not buying, but since the receiver is rational and indifferent, the receiver can be indifferent or mix; however, buying does not provide a strictly higher payoff so according to strict rationality, do not buy (y2=0) or randomize.\n\nBut since there is no positive incentive for buying at sigma=1 given the posterior of 0.5, the receiver will choose not to buy for both signals.\n\nReceiver's expected payoff in this scenario if not buying on any signal is 0, and if buying at sigma=1, expected payoff is 0, no gain.\n\nTherefore, the receiver will choose not to buy regardless of signal.\n\nThis leads to the sender selling no products, so sender's expected payoff is 0. However, the receiver maximizes their own expected payoff by not buying.\n\nHence, the receiver's action rule is:\n- pi(a=1|sigma=0)=0\n- pi(a=1|sigma=1)=0",

  "Analysis": "At timestep 0, I proposed a signaling scheme where bad quality products (s=0) have a 0.5 probability of being recommended and good quality products (s=1) are always recommended. The receiver chose never to buy any product, so both players ended with zero payoff. This is not beneficial for me, as I want to sell products, and the receiver wants to only buy good products. To incentivize the buyer to buy some products, I need to increase the informativeness of my signals, so the buyer can differentiate good from bad products better and buy selectively. Therefore, I should send signal 1 with a lower probability for bad products and signal 1 almost always for good products, to let the receiver learn and act accordingly. A signaling scheme like (x1=0, x2=1) fully separates bad and good products by signal, which enables the receiver to potentially buy only when signal is 1, increasing expected sales and payoffs. This scheme increases the buyer's expected payoff if they trust the signal and buy only on signal 1. This should encourage the receiver to use a strategy of buying only when signal=1. Given rationality, this is more beneficial for me as a sender, increasing the expected number of products sold, so I choose (0,1).",

  "Analysis": "As the sender, my goal is to maximize the number of products sold. Since buyers get a positive payoff only from buying good products and a negative payoff for buying bad products, the buyer will be cautious in buying based on the signals I send. If I recommend all products (always send signal 1), the buyer will realize that the signal has no informational value and likely not buy to avoid losses, resulting in fewer sales. If I send signal 1 only when the product is good and signal 0 otherwise (fully reveal), the buyer will buy only good products, maximizing their payoff but only purchasing the good products (1/3 of total), resulting in fewer total sales than recommending all products. However, in such a separating equilibrium, the buyer trusts the signal and buys products with signal 1 fully. Given the buyer acts rationally and self-interestedly, the best way to maximize sales is to send signal 1 for all products regardless of quality (x1=1, x2=1). This may result in buyers acting with prior belief and buying with some probability, maximizing the sender's expected payoff. Therefore, recommending all products, despite some being bad, maximizes expected sales for me as a self-interested seller.",

  "Analysis": "Previously, I chose to always recommend (x1=1, x2=1), but the receiver never bought (y1=0, y2=0), leading to zero payoff for both. As a sender aiming to maximize sales, it is better to differentiate signals to induce the receiver to buy good products but not bad ones. Full separation signaling (x1=0, x2=1) means I recommend only good products. The receiver, being rational and self-interested, will buy when recommended and not buy when not recommended. This can incentivize the receiver to buy only when signal=1. This improves expected payoff for me since at least all good products will be sold, and potentially also induces buying on only signal=1, otherwise zero payoff if recommendation is uninformative. Since I am the sender and make the first move, committing to full separation will likely increase receiver's willingness to buy on signal 1, improving my expected sales. Therefore, I choose (x1=0, x2=1) to separate good and bad products.",

  "Analysis": "As the sender, my goal is to maximize the number of products sold, regardless of their quality. The buyer aims to maximize their own payoff by purchasing only good products and avoiding bad products. The prior distribution is 1/3 good and 2/3 bad. If I fully recommend all products (send signal 1 for both good and bad), the buyer expecting to maximize their own payoff will anticipate half bad products and half good products on average after updating beliefs from signals, leading to potential rejection of all products or partial acceptance. If I never recommend products (send signal 0 for both), no sales occur. If I send signal 0 for bad products and signal 1 for good products (fully revealing quality), the buyer will buy only good products, but I would sell fewer total items. Since I get reward 1 for each sale regardless of product quality, I want to induce the buyer to buy as many products as possible, even if some are bad. Therefore, pooling all products as recommended (x1=1, x2=1) maximizes sales but risks buyer rejecting some purchases, depending on action rule. Alternatively, partially mixing signals can be considered. However, given buyer's rationality, the buyer will calculate posterior and possibly reject signal 1 trust entirely if I recommend bad products too often. But as a self-interested sender, I will fully recommend all products since this maximizes the probability of sales despite buyer's criticism. This is a dominant strategy to maximize my expected sales. Thus, I commit to always sending signal 1 regardless of state (x1=1, x2=1).",

  "Analysis": "The sender commits to always sending signal 1 regardless of the product quality (x1=1 for bad products and x2=1 for good products). This means the signal provides no information to differentiate quality. Given that both signals are always 1, the posterior belief after receiving signal 1 remains the prior: 1/3 good and 2/3 bad. The expected payoff for buying blindly is: buyer's expected payoff = (1/3)*1 + (2/3)*(-1) = 1/3 - 2/3 = -1/3 < 0, thus buying is expected to bring negative payoff. The buyer should not buy after signal 1, but since signal 0 never occurs (never sent), the receiver's action on sigma=0 is irrelevant. Therefore, the best rational strategy is to never buy regardless of signal, i.e., y1 = 0 and y2 = 0.",

  "Analysis": "Previously, I proposed signaling both bad and good products with signal 1 (x1=1, x2=1), but the receiver decided to never buy regardless of signal (y1=0, y2=0), resulting in zero payoff for both. Since the receiver is not trusting the signals, I should try a separating strategy to convince the receiver to buy the good products (s=1) while not buying the bad ones (s=0). If I honestly recommend only good products (x1=0, x2=1), then the receiver can update their posterior and decide to buy only when signal=1, rejecting products recommended with signal=0. This would yield positive payoffs for me because buyers will only buy good products, and I get 1 per sold item. Thus, my best response is to set x1=0 (never recommend bad products) and x2=1 (always recommend good products). This creates incentive for the receiver to buy signal=1 products, increasing my expected payoff.",

  "Analysis": "Given the sender's signaling scheme varphi with x1=0 and x2=1, the sender sends signal 1 only if the product is good (s=1) and signal 0 if the product is bad (s=0). This allows the receiver to perfectly infer the product quality from the signal. Thus, when receiving sigma=1, the posterior belief that the product is good is 1, and when receiving sigma=0, the posterior belief it is good is 0. Therefore, the best response for the receiver is to buy (a=1) when sigma=1 and not buy (a=0) when sigma=0, maximizing the receiver's expected reward by buying only good products. This action rule also incentivizes the sender to truthfully reveal product quality. Hence, the rational decision is y1=0 and y2=1.",

  "Analysis": "As the sender, my goal is to maximize the number of products sold. I gain 1 unit of payoff for every product sold, regardless of its quality. The buyer gains 1 for purchasing good products and -1 for purchasing bad products. Because 2/3 of products are bad (s=0) and 1/3 are good (s=1), the buyer will be cautious to avoid losses. If I signal all products as recommended (signal=1), then the buyer will anticipate many bad products and likely refuse to buy, lowering my sales. If I never recommend products (signal=0 always), then no products are sold, and my payoff is zero. To maximize sales, I need a signaling scheme that induces the buyer to buy some products while not losing all trust. I consider separating equilibrium strategies where I recommend only highly likely good products, or partially pooling strategies mixing signals on bad products. Given the payoff structure, the buyer will buy if the posterior probability that the product is good given a signal is at least 0.5. I will commit to always recommending good quality products (x2=1) and never recommending bad quality products (x1=0). In this way, the buyer can strictly interpret signal=1 as good product and buy with confidence, and signal=0 as bad product and refrain from buying. This signaling maximizes the number of sales of good products, and the buyer is incentivized to buy only on signal=1, maximizing my payoff. So the signaling scheme is (x1=0, x2=1).",

  "Analysis": "The sender commits to signaling scheme varphi with x1=0 and x2=1. This means: when the product is bad (s=0), the sender always sends signal 0, and when the product is good (s=1), the sender always sends signal 1. This is a fully separating equilibrium. Given this, the receiver can perfectly infer the product quality from the signal. \n\nThe receiver's rational best response is to buy (a=1) if the signal is 1, since the product is certainly good, yielding +1 expected payoff. If the signal is 0, the product is certainly bad, so the receiver should not buy (a=0) to avoid -1 payoff. Therefore, the receiver's optimal action rule is y1=0 and y2=1. This maximizes the receiver's expected payoff by buying only good products and rejecting bad ones.",

  "Analysis": "As the sender, my goal is to maximize sales, i.e., maximize the expected number of products sold, regardless of product quality. The buyer is self-interested and prefers to buy only good products to maximize their payoff. Given the prior distribution (1/3 good, 2/3 bad), if I send no signals (always signal 0), the buyer will update beliefs and likely not buy, as the expected quality is low (1/3). If I truthfully recommend good products (signal=1 for good) and not recommend bad products (signal=0 for bad), the buyer will buy only when receiving signal=1, i.e., only goods get sold, yielding sales equal to 1/3 in expectation. However, I can sell more by mixing signals; for example, recommending all products (signal=1 always) will sell all products but buyer payoff is negative due to many bad products bought, so buyer will not fully trust such signals and may not buy. The best for me is to pool bad products into signal 1 alongside good, raising total sales, but buyer reacts based on posterior beliefs. I analyze separating and pooling strategies. Separating (x1=0, x2=1): buyer buys only on signal=1 (good), selling 1/3 products. Pooling all as signal=1 (x1=1, x2=1) leads buyer to assess overall quality = 1/3, which is low, so buyer may reject buying upon signal=1 because expected payoff for them is negative. Buyer will buy only if expected quality >= 0.5, because payoff for action=1 is +1 for good product, -1 for bad product, so buyer buys only if posterior probability of good >= 0.5. Thus, I must design signal such that posterior of good on signal=1 is at least 0.5 so buyer buys on signal=1 with high probability. By mixing signals probabilistically for bad products, I can increase total sales while ensuring buyer buys on signal=1. Considering the math, the most straightforward is full separation (x1=0, x2=1), as buyer will buy only on signal=1, selling all good products. Selling bad products gain me reward, but buyer's penalty makes them less likely to buy if bad products recommended. Pooling good and bad fully leads to buyer rejecting purchase. Subtle partial pooling risks the buyer reducing buying probability. So maximum sales I can guarantee rationally is selling all good products honestly. Therefore, I propose the separating scheme: signal=1 only for good products (x2=1), signal=0 for bad (x1=0).",

  "Analysis": "The sender's signaling scheme is to send signal 0 when the product quality is bad (s=0) and signal 1 when the product quality is good (s=1). This perfectly reveals the product quality. Upon receiving signal 0, the posterior belief about the product being good is 0, so buying yields expected payoff -1 for the receiver. Upon receiving signal 1, the posterior belief that the product is good is 1, so buying yields expected payoff +1. Given that the sender's signals perfectly reveal the quality, it is optimal for the receiver to buy only when receiving signal 1 and not buy when receiving signal 0. Therefore, the receiver's action rule should be y1=0 (no buy on signal 0) and y2=1 (buy on signal 1).",

  "Analysis": "As the sender, my goal is to maximize the number of products sold. Selling any product yields a reward of 1 regardless of quality. The buyer gains 1 for buying a good product and loses 1 for buying a bad product. The prior distribution is 1/3 good and 2/3 bad products. Without signaling, the buyer knowing only the prior will be skeptical about buying. To maximize sales, I should try to convince the buyer to buy products by making both good and bad products appear recommendable. However, if I mark all products as recommend (signal = 1), the buyer’s posterior after receiving signal=1 will be exactly the prior of 1/3 good products, and the buyer may not always buy. By mixing signals (partially recommending bad products, fully recommending good products), I can potentially induce buyer to buy products more frequently. The best strategy is to always recommend good products (x2 = 1), and recommend bad products with some probability x1 to increase overall sales. Since the buyer is rational and will base purchase decisions on signals and knowledge of the sender's signaling scheme, sending some signal 1 in bad states can help increase sales but risks reducing buyer willingness to buy on signal 1 if the buyer anticipates deception. Nevertheless, because buyer's reward is positive for good and negative for bad, the buyer will update beliefs accordingly. To maximize my sales, I will commit to sending signal 1 with probability 1 for good products (x2=1) and send signal 1 with probability x1 for bad products, where x1 is greater than 0 but less than 1 to partially blur the signal and increase sales on bad products. To keep it simple, choose x1=0.5 to balance the tradeoff between selling bad products and maintaining credibility.",

  "Analysis": "The sender's goal is to maximize the number of products sold, regardless of product quality. The buyer wants to maximize purchases of good products and minimize purchases of bad products. The prior distribution is 1/3 good quality and 2/3 bad quality. The sender can send signal 1 (recommend) with some probability depending on the product quality (x1 for bad, x2 for good). If the sender recommends both good and bad products with high probability (e.g., x1=1, x2=1), the buyer will likely learn that the signal is uninformative and may not buy. If the sender only recommends good products (x1=0, x2=1), the buyer finds the signal informative and will buy when recommended. However, the sender fails to sell bad products this way. If the sender recommends some bad products but less often than good (e.g., x1=0.5, x2=1), the buyer may partially trust the signal. The best signaling scheme for the sender to maximize sales is to always recommend all products (x1=1, x2=1), because seller always gets 1 per sale regardless of quality. Buyers, being rational and self-interested, upon detecting no difference, may ignore signals or sometimes buy anyway due to prior. But sender can then at least get some sales from all products. Therefore, the sender should commit to signaling scheme with x1=1 and x2=1 to maximize expected sales.",

  "Analysis": "The sender commits to always sending signal 1 regardless of the product quality (x1=1 and x2=1). Given this, the signal completely reveals no information since both good and bad products receive signal 1. As a rational and self-interested receiver aiming to maximize own expected payoff, I will calculate the expected payoff of buying (action=1) and not buying (action=0) after receiving signal 1. The posterior belief after signal 1 equals the prior because the signal does not distinguish quality: Probability(product is good) = 1/3, bad = 2/3. Expected reward from buying: (1/3)*1 + (2/3)*(-1) = 1/3 - 2/3 = -1/3 < 0. Expected reward from not buying is 0. Therefore, upon receiving signal 1, it is better to not buy (a=0) with probability 1. As signal 0 never occurs (x1=1 and x2=1), the action for sigma=0 can be arbitrary; choosing 0 to be consistent. Hence, the best response is y1=0 and y2=0.",

  "Analysis": "Previously, I proposed to always recommend (x1=1, x2=1), but the receiver never bought (y1=0, y2=0), resulting in zero payoff for both. Since the receiver is rational, they avoid buying due to the risk of bad products. To induce buying, I must better separate signals by only recommending high-quality products (x1=0, x2=1), so the buyer can trust signal 1 corresponds to good products and buy upon that signal. This increases my expected sales (at least when signal=1), maximizing my payoff. If I reveal I only recommend good products, the receiver will buy when signal=1 (since it's expected good quality) and avoid buy on signal=0, yielding higher joint payoffs but I focus on my own payoff by enabling trust in my recommendation. This strategy optimizes my expected sales given buyer rationality.",

  "Analysis": "Given the sender's signaling scheme with x1=0 (bad quality products always signal 0) and x2=1 (good quality products always signal 1), the receiver can perfectly infer product quality from the signal. Since the prior probabilities are 1/3 good and 2/3 bad products, the receiver's best response is to buy products only when the signal is 1 (which corresponds to good quality) and not buy when the signal is 0 (which corresponds to bad quality). This maximizes the receiver's expected payoff: buying good products yields +1 per purchase and rejecting bad products avoids a -1 penalty. The expected payoff under this strategy is positive, so the receiver will set y1=0 (not buy when signal=0) and y2=1 (buy when signal=1). This response also benefits the sender by facilitating sales of good products, but since the receiver is self-interested, the decision is purely based on receiver payoff maximization.",

  "Analysis": "As the sender, I want to maximize sales. Selling all products regardless of quality yields the highest payoff since both good and bad products sold give me a payoff of 1. However, the receiver is rational and wants to avoid buying bad products because they incur a penalty. If I reveal truthfully (x1=0 for bad products send signal 0, x2=1 for good products send signal 1), the receiver can conditionally decide to only buy when receiving signal 1, thus buying only good products. This yields me a payoff on good product sales but none on bad products. I can try to pool by mixing signals, but if I send signal 1 for some bad products, the receiver's posterior will be diluted and reduce their buying probability after signal 1. Thus, selling all by always recommending (x1=1, x2=1) maximizes my sales because the receiver cannot distinguish and may buy some fraction of products. The best receiver response might be to buy all or some part of signal 1 products. Since the prior is 1/3 good, 2/3 bad, if I fully recommend all products, the receiver will expect quality 1/3 for signal 1, and have an expected payoff of 1*1/3 + (-1)*2/3 = -1/3 for buying, which is negative, so they won’t buy. Hence, selling all by recommending everything does not guarantee sales. Instead, sending signal 1 for all good products (x2=1) and no bad products (x1=0) might credibly signal quality, inducing buying on signal 1. This way, the receiver will buy only when signal is 1, improving my sales on good products. Since I only get payoff when product is sold, this scenario is better than pooling with buyer not buying. Thus, the best signaling scheme is honest signaling: x1=0, x2=1.",

  "Analysis": "The sender's signaling scheme is separating: signal 1 perfectly indicates good quality (s=1), and signal 0 perfectly indicates bad quality (s=0). Given that, the receiver's posterior beliefs upon observing signals are: P(s=1|sigma=0)=0 and P(s=1|sigma=1)=1. The receiver wants to buy when the expected payoff is positive. For sigma=0, expected payoff from buying is P(s=1|sigma=0)*1 + P(s=0|sigma=0)*(-1) = 0*1 + 1*(-1) = -1 < 0, so do not buy. For sigma=1, expected payoff from buying is 1*1 + 0*(-1) = 1 > 0, so buy. Hence, the best response is pi(a=1|sigma=0)=0 and pi(a=1|sigma=1)=1.",
