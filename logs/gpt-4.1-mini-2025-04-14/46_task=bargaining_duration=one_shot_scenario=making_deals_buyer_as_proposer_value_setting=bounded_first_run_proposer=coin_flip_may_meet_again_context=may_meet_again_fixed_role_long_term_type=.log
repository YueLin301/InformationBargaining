  "Analysis": "As the proposer, I want to choose a price x between 0 and 0.5 to maximize my payoff, which is (1 + 2*x)/3, while ensuring that the responder accepts the offer. The responder will accept only if their payoff (1 - 2*x)/3 is at least 0, otherwise they get nothing by rejecting. So to ensure acceptance, I must have (1 - 2*x)/3 >= 0, which implies x <= 0.5. Since x can be as high as 0.5, I maximize my payoff by choosing x = 0.5. At x=0.5, responder's payoff is zero, so responder is indifferent between accepting and rejecting; since they're rational, they may accept (no payoff loss) or reject (no gain). To be safe, I can choose x just slightly less than 0.5 to guarantee strictly positive payoff for responder and acceptance. But since rational responders do not accept negative payoffs, setting x=0.5 makes responder payoff zero, which is acceptable. Therefore, choosing x=0.5 maximizes my payoff at (1 + 2*0.5)/3 = (1 + 1)/3 = 2/3 ~ 0.6667 with responder payoff 0. Alternatively, I could offer less to get safer acceptance but at lower payoff. Since responder is rational and self-interested, they will accept if payoff is non-negative. Hence, choosing x=0.5 maximizes my payoff.",

The responder's payoff if accepting is (1 - 2*x)/3, and they will only accept if this payoff is non-negative, i.e., (1 - 2*x)/3 >= 0, which simplifies to x <= 0.5. Given I can propose any price x in [0,0.5], the responder will accept any x in this range. To maximize my payoff, I choose the highest possible x, which is 0.5. This leaves the responder with zero payoff, the minimum they can accept, but still non-negative, so they should accept. Hence, I propose x=0.5 to maximize my utility.",

  "Analysis": "As the proposer, I want to maximize my own payoff (1+2*x)/3 while ensuring that the responder accepts the offer. The responder's payoff if accepting is (1-2*x)/3. Since the responder is self-interested and rational, they will accept the offer only if their payoff is at least 0, otherwise, they will reject. The minimum payoff they are willing to accept is 0, so (1-2*x)/3 >= 0 implies x <= 0.5. Since x can be as large as 0.5, I can set x = 0.5 to maximize my payoff, which gives me (1 + 2*0.5)/3 = (1 + 1)/3 = 2/3. The responder would get (1 - 2*0.5)/3 = (1 - 1)/3 = 0, which is acceptable as they get zero payoff rather than negative. Therefore, I will propose x = 0.5 to maximize my own payoff, anticipating the responder to accept because zero payoff is better than rejection payoff of zero.",

Since the responder is rational and self-interested, they will accept any offer giving them non-negative payoff. To maximize my own payoff, I set x = 0.5, where I get (1 + 2*0.5)/3 = (1 + 1)/3 = 2/3 ≈ 0.6667 and the responder gets zero, so the responder is indifferent but not worse off rejecting.

  "Analysis": "As the proposer, I want to maximize my payoff, which is (1 + 2*x)/3. The responder will accept the offer only if their payoff (1 - 2*x)/3 is at least as good as rejecting (which gives 0). Therefore, (1 - 2*x)/3 >= 0 implies x <= 0.5. Since x must be between 0 and 0.5, the responder is indifferent if x = 0.5 and accepts for any x <= 0.5. To maximize my payoff, I should set the highest x allowed, which is 0.5. At x=0.5, my payoff is (1 + 2*0.5)/3 = (1 + 1)/3 = 2/3 ≈ 0.6667, and the responder's payoff is 0. To ensure acceptance, I can set x=0.5 since the responder is rational and indifferent between accepting zero and rejecting zero, but accepting still gives non-negative payoff. Therefore, I will choose x=0.5 to maximize my own payoff.",

 Now the proposer decides that x=0.5.

The responder will accept only if their payoff (1-2*x)/3 is greater than 0, otherwise they reject and both get 0. Thus, responder accepts iff (1-2*x)/3 > 0, or equivalently x < 0.5. To maximize my payoff while ensuring acceptance, I should propose the largest x possible less than 0.5 to keep more payoff. Choosing x = 0.5 yields responder payoff 0, still acceptable since 0 is not less than 0, but responder indifferent, may accept or reject. To be safe, I propose x slightly less than 0.5 (e.g., 0.4999), ensuring responder strictly positive payoff and acceptance. Therefore, I choose x close to 0.5 to maximize my payoff while ensuring acceptance.",
