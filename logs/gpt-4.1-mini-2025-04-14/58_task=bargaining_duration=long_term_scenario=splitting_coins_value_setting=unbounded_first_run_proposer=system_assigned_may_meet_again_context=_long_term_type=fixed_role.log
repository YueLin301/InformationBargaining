  "Analysis": "As the proposer at timestep 0, I want to maximize my payoff while ensuring the responder accepts the offer. The responder will accept the offer if the payoff (1 - x) they receive from acceptance is greater than 0, as rejection yields zero payoff to both. The responder is rational and self-interested, so any positive share (1 - x) > 0 is acceptable. To maximize my payoff, I want to offer the smallest positive amount to the responder. However, offering exactly 0 leaves the responder with zero reward, which will be rejected as indifferent players prefer accepting over rejecting if payoffs are equal is not guaranteed. Thus, offering the smallest positive amount epsilon > 0 is ideal. Since the game is defined on real numbers between 0 and 1, I'll choose x = 1 - ε, where ε is a very small positive amount close to 0, so the responder prefers acceptance. For practical purposes, I will use x = 0.999, leaving 0.001 to the responder, which maximizes my payoff subject to acceptance.",

The responder is rational and self-interested, so they will accept the offer only if (1 - x) > 0, meaning they get a positive payoff. To maximize my payoff, I should offer the smallest positive amount to the responder that ensures acceptance, i.e., I keep almost all the money but leave the responder with a minimal positive payoff. However, since the offer is continuous, I can offer just above 0 for the responder, e.g., x = 0.99, keeping 99% for myself and 1% for the responder. This will be accepted as it gives the responder a positive payoff better than 0 from rejection. Therefore, I propose x = 0.99.",

Since getting 0.01 now is better than 0 if the game ends, and my rejection might lead to no better offers, I need to evaluate if rejecting has expected higher payoff.

The responder is rational and self-interested, so they will accept only if the offer's remainder (1 - x) is at least as good as their best expected payoff in future rounds. Since the game ends at timestep 5, both players know that rejecting the offer leads to zero payoff eventually. Hence, the responder will accept any offer that gives them a positive payoff, no matter how small. To maximize my payoff while still getting accepted, I should offer the smallest amount above 0 to the responder.

  "Analysis": "As the proposer at timestep 0, I want to maximize my own payoff. The responder will accept any offer that gives them at least as much payoff as rejecting (which is 0). So I can offer the smallest positive amount to the responder, 0, meaning I keep the entire amount for myself, x=1. The responder will accept since they get 0 or more. However, if the responder is rational and self-interested, they will only accept if they get at least something positive because accepting 0 is indifferent to rejecting (both 0 payoff), they might reject due to no gain. To ensure acceptance, I should offer a minimal positive amount, say a very small epsilon, so the responder gets some non-zero payoff. Since minimal positive real number is difficult to represent precisely, I will use x=0.99 (I keep 99%, responder gets 1%) which should be acceptable to the responder since 1% > 0 payoff from rejecting. This maximizes my payoff while ensuring acceptance.",

Proposal:
 Now the proposer decides that x=0.99.
