Therefore, the responder will accept if 1 - x >= 0, i.e., x <= 1. Since x <= 1 always, the responder will accept any x in [0,1], but the responder prefers to accept only if they get a positive payoff, so x must be less than or equal to 1. To maximize my payoff, I should set x as high as possible but making the responder indifferent between accepting and rejecting, which is x = 1. At x = 1, the responder's payoff is 0, which is equal to rejecting. Rationally, responders accept if payoff >= 0, so they accept at 0 payoff. Thus, I will choose x = 1 to maximize my payoff.",

Since any x <= 1 yields a non-negative payoff for the buyer, and rational responders accept offers that give them non-negative payoff, the buyer will accept any x <= 1. To maximize my payoff, I will set x as close to 1 as possible, since at x=1 the buyer gets 0 payoff but still accepts, since rejecting yields 0 as well.

The responder will accept the offer if and only if their payoff (1 - x) is at least 0, i.e., 1 - x >= 0 or x <= 1. Since any offer x between 0 and 1 will give the responder a non-negative payoff, the best I can do is to propose the highest x such that the responder still accepts. The responder, being rational, will accept any offer with a positive payoff for themselves. If I propose x = 1, the responder payoff is zero (1 - 1 = 0), which is indifferent but still acceptable. Hence I can propose x = 1 to maximize my payoff while still getting the offer accepted.",

The responder (buyer) will accept the price if and only if their payoff (1 - x) is non-negative and rationally better than rejecting (which yields 0). Since the responder is rational and self-interested, they will accept any offer where 1 - x >= 0, meaning any x <= 1. They gain something rather than nothing. To maximize my payoff, I will propose x = 1, keeping all the value. However, then the responder gets 0, so they are indifferent between accepting and rejecting. Assuming they accept in the case of indifference to maximize my payoff, x=1 is optimal. Alternatively, if they reject to at least cause me to get 0, I can lower the price slightly to x = 1 - ε, with ε→0. To be safe and more realistic, I propose x = 1, which gives me the maximum payoff.",

  "Analysis": "As the proposer, I want to maximize my payoff x, but the responder will only accept an offer if their payoff (1 - x) is at least as good as rejecting (which yields 0). Since the responder is rational and self-interested, they will accept any offer where 1 - x >= 0, i.e., x <= 1. To maximize my payoff, I should offer the minimum amount that ensures acceptance, which is x = 1, but then the responder gets 0 and may reject since they are indifferent. However, since the responder's payoff for accepting is 1 - x and rejecting is 0, and the responder is rational, they will accept any offer strictly better than 0. So, I can choose x just less than 1 to get almost the full amount while ensuring acceptance. To simplify, I will choose x = 1, considering the responder will accept if indifferent because rejection results in zero payoff, but to be safer, I will slightly reduce x to guarantee acceptance. So I will choose x = 0.999.",

Since the responder is self-interested and rational, they will accept the offer only if their payoff (1-x) is at least zero, i.e., x <= 1. To ensure the responder accepts, I should offer the minimum amount that makes the responder indifferent between accepting and rejecting, which is when their payoff is zero. Offering x = 1 means the responder gets 0, which they will accept since it's not negative and yields no worse than rejecting. Offering any x > 1 is not allowed, and offering less than 1 will increase their payoff but decrease mine. Since playing again is possible, and roles may switch, offering x=1 is most rational as it maximizes my payoff while still being acceptable to the responder.",

Since the responder is rational and self-interested, they will accept any offer with (1 - x) >= 0, i.e., x <= 1. To maximize my payoff, I should set x as high as possible while ensuring acceptance, which means offering the minimum that the responder needs to accept, so (1 - x) > 0, or x < 1. Given that the responder is rational, they will accept any nonzero positive payoff. Thus, I can set x very close to 1. To avoid any uncertainty in acceptance, I set x = 1, which makes the responder indifferent between accepting and rejecting (getting 0 either way). They might reject at x=1, so it’s safer to slightly lower x to ensure acceptance. Hence, I choose x = 0.999 to guarantee acceptance with nearly maximal payoff.",

Since they are rational and self-interested, they will accept any offer where (1 - x) >= 0, i.e., x <= 1. To maximize my payoff while ensuring acceptance, I choose x as close to 1 as possible. However, if I propose x = 1, the responder's payoff is 0, and they are indifferent but can reject without loss, so to ensure acceptance, I lower x slightly, for example, x = 0.99999. This ensures the responder strictly prefers acceptance (1 - 0.99999 = 0.00001 > 0). Thus, I maximize my payoff while ensuring the deal is accepted.",

  "Analysis": "As the proposer, I want to maximize my payoff x while ensuring the responder accepts the offer. The responder receives 1 - x if they accept. Being rational and self-interested, the responder will accept only if their payoff is at least as much as rejecting (which gives 0). Therefore, the responder will accept any offer where 1 - x >= 0, i.e., x <= 1. To maximize my payoff, I can set x as high as possible without losing acceptance, so x = 1 is acceptable to the responder since they get 0. However, the responder may reject if the payoff is exactly 0 since that's indifferent. Given potential future games and rationality, it's safer to give the responder at least a tiny positive payoff (e.g., 1 - x > 0) to ensure acceptance. But since we play once, the minimal positive payoff can be arbitrarily close to zero. For a concrete number, setting x = 1 means the responder gets 0 and might reject, which is risky. Alternatively, setting x = 0.999 gives the responder 0.001, ensuring acceptance. Thus, I choose x = 0.999 to maximize my payoff and secure acceptance.",

 Now the proposer decides that x=0.999.
