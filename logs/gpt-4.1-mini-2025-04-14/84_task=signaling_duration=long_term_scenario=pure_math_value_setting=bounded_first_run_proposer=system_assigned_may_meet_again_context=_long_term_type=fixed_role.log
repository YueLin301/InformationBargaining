  "Analysis": "As the sender, my payoff is 1 whenever the receiver chooses action 1, regardless of the state. The receiver benefits only when the state is 1 and action 1 is chosen, but is harmed if action 1 is chosen when the state is 0. Given the prior (state 0 occurs 2/3 of the time), the receiver would prefer to choose action 0 if they ignore my signals, resulting in zero payoff for me. To induce the receiver to choose action 1, I can send signal 1 with high probability both for state 0 and state 1, effectively making the receiver believe the state is likely to be 1 when receiving signal 1. However, if I send the same signal in both states with probability 1, the receiver's posterior remains the prior, meaning they will prefer action 0. Therefore, to incentivize the receiver to take action 1 in response to signal 1, I should design a signaling scheme where signal 1 is sent only in state 1, signal 0 is sent only in state 0 (i.e., x1=0, x2=1). This perfectly reveals the state. However, the receiver will then pick action 1 only upon signal 1, and action 0 upon signal 0, giving me an expected payoff of 1 * (1/3) for the times state = 1, but zero for state = 0 (since action 0 is taken). Alternatively, I could send signal 1 always (x1=1, x2=1), but then the receiver will keep prior beliefs and pick action 0, my payoff zero. If I mix signals, I dilute the receiver's information. The best for me is to fully separate signals (x1=0, x2=1), inducing the receiver to take action 1 when signal=1 and action 0 when signal=0. Although I don't get payoff from state=0, I maximize payoff from state=1, and the receiver will be willing to respond accordingly because signal 1 perfectly reveals state=1. Therefore, I commit to the signaling scheme x1=0, x2=1.",

The receiver can perfectly infer the state from the signal. Given the payoff structure, the receiver's best actions are: for signal 0 (state 0), choose action 0 (payoff 0 vs. -1 if action 1); for signal 1 (state 1), choose action 1 (payoff 1 vs. 0 if action 0). Hence, the best response is pi(a=1|sigma=0) = 0 and pi(a=1|sigma=1) = 1. Following this strategy maximizes the receiver's expected payoff.",

  "Analysis": "As the sender, I want to maximize my expected payoff. The sender's payoff is 1 whenever the receiver takes action 1, regardless of the state. The receiver's payoffs differ: it suffers a loss (-1) if it takes action 1 when the state is 0, but gains 1 if it takes action 1 when the state is 1. The prior puts more probability (2/3) on state 0. The receiver is rational and self-interested, so it will want to avoid taking action 1 if it believes the state is more likely 0. To persuade the receiver to take action 1, the sender must design signals that credibly indicate state 1 to increase the receiver’s posterior belief sufficiently. However, if the sender tries to send signal 1 more often in state 0 (to induce action 1), it risks the receiver updating its belief downward and avoiding action 1 altogether. The sender’s best strategy is to always send signal 1 only when state=1 and never send signal 1 when state=0 (i.e., x1=0, x2=1). This is a separating signaling scheme. The receiver can then fully trust signal 1 to mean state=1 and take action 1 on signal 1, and take action 0 on signal 0. This enables the sender to get payoff=1 when state=1, and 0 otherwise. The expected payoff is mu_0(1)*1 = 1/3. Any mixing by the sender in state 0 would make the signal less informative and reduce expected payoff. Therefore, I commit to varphi with x1=0, x2=1 to maximize my payoff while enabling the receiver a credible posterior belief update. This is consistent with rationality on both sides.",

{
  "Analysis": "As a self-interested sender, my goal is to maximize my own expected payoff. The sender gains 1 whenever the receiver chooses action 1, regardless of the state. The receiver gains or loses differently depending on the state and action: action 1 yields payoff -1 to the receiver when state=0 and +1 when state=1. Given that the receiver is rational and self-interested, they are unlikely to always choose action 1 if they cannot distinguish states. If I always send the same signal regardless of the state (e.g., always signal 1), the receiver will respond based on the prior. The prior probability of state=0 is 2/3, state=1 is 1/3. The expected receiver payoff for action 1 under prior is (2/3)*(-1) + (1/3)*(1) = -2/3 + 1/3 = -1/3 < 0. So the receiver prefers action 0 if ignoring the signals. To induce the receiver to take action 1 more often, I need to design a signaling scheme that enables informativeness. Because when the receiver knows the state=1 signal, they will choose action 1; when the state=0 signal is sent, they will choose action 0 because action 1 is costly. So a fully separating scheme is beneficial: send signal 0 when s=0 and signal 1 when s=1 (i.e., x1=0, x2=1). This makes the receiver able to infer the state perfectly and respond optimally, so the receiver chooses a=0 after signal=0 and a=1 after signal=1, maximizing both players' payoffs given their interests. I get 1 payoff when the state=1 and action=1, and when state=0, action=0 yields 0 payoff, but this is better than the receiver ignoring signals and always choosing action 0 resulting in zero sender payoff. Thus, the best signaling scheme for me is (x1=0, x2=1).",

  "Analysis": "As the sender, my payoff is 1 if the receiver chooses action 1 regardless of the state and 0 otherwise. The receiver's payoff is negative (-1) when state=0 and action=1, zero when action=0, and positive (1) when state=1 and action=1. The receiver is self-interested and rational, so they want to maximize their expected payoff. Given the prior probabilities (2/3 for state=0 and 1/3 for state=1), the receiver expects action=0 to be better without any signaling since action=1 triggers a negative expected payoff (2/3*(-1) + 1/3*1 = -1/3 < 0). To persuade the receiver to choose action=1 beneficial to me, I need to send signals that separate state 1 from state 0 so that the receiver can update beliefs and decide action=1 when signal=1 with sufficiently high posterior probability of state=1. A separating signaling scheme enables this. I will propose a fully separating scheme where signal=0 is always sent for state=0 (x1=0) and signal=1 is always sent for state=1 (x2=1). This allows the receiver to infer exactly the state from the signal. The receiver can then choose action=1 when signal=1 and action=0 when signal=0. Thus, the receiver will respond optimally, and I get payoff 1 in every round where state=1 and also where state=0 with action=0 giving me 0 (no loss), maximizing my expected payoff. This is the best I can do strategically to improve my payoff given the receiver's rationality.",

  "Analysis": "The sender commits to signaling scheme varphi with x1=0 and x2=1, meaning signal 1 is sent only when the state is 1, and signal 0 when the state is 0. Given this, the signals perfectly reveal the state (the sender is fully separating). As a self-interested rational receiver, I want to maximize my expected payoff. Recall the payoff rules: for state 0, action 0 yields 0 payoff and action 1 yields -1 (worse for me); for state 1, action 1 yields 1, and action 0 yields 0. Therefore, it is optimal for me to take action 0 when signal=0 (state likely 0) and action 1 when signal=1 (state likely 1). Hence y1=0 and y2=1.

{
    "Analysis": "As the sender, my goal is to maximize my expected payoff. Sending signal 1 always yields action 1 by the receiver when the receiver believes the signal to be informative. Since I get reward 1 whenever the receiver takes action 1 regardless of the state, I can always maximize my payoff by sending signal 1 regardless of the state (x1=1, x2=1), ensuring the receiver takes action 1. However, if the receiver anticipates this and decides to ignore the signal, they stick to their prior belief. The receiver's best response to the prior is to choose action 0 (since expected reward for action 1 is (2/3)*(-1)+(1/3)*(1) = -1/3 < 0), so the receiver would take action 0 if ignoring signals, giving me 0 payoff. To improve my payoff, I can try partially separating signals to persuade the receiver to take action 1 on signal 1 and action 0 on 0. Given the receiver's incentives, they would want to take action 1 only if posterior belief that state=1 given signal ≥ 0.5. A simple credible signaling is to send signal 1 only when state = 1 (x1=0, x2=1). This induces the receiver to take action 1 following signal 1 and 0 following signal 0, maximizing both parties' payoffs. I will commit to this full separating scheme (x1=0, x2=1) to maximize my own expected payoff while keeping the receiver willing to follow the informative action rule pi_1.",

  "Analysis": "The sender's signaling scheme is varphi(sigma=1|s=0)=0 and varphi(sigma=1|s=1)=1, meaning signal 0 perfectly identifies state 0, and signal 1 perfectly identifies state 1. Given this, the receiver's posterior belief after receiving signal 0 is state=0 with probability 1, and after receiving signal 1 is state=1 with probability 1. The receiver's best response is to choose action 0 after signal 0 to get 0 payoff (better than -1 if choosing action 1), and action 1 after signal 1 (payoff 1 > 0). Because the sender's signaling is fully revealing, the receiver following pi_1 (best response to posterior) strictly improves the receiver's expected payoff compared to ignoring signals (pi_0). Therefore, I choose y1=0 (action 1 probability given signal 0) and y2=1 (action 1 probability given signal 1).",

If I fully reveal the state (signal=0 for s=0 and signal=1 for s=1, i.e., x1=0, x2=1), the receiver, being rational and self-interested, will choose a=0 upon signal 0 and a=1 upon signal 1, maximizing their own payoff. Therefore, expected sender payoff is: 2/3*0 + 1/3*1=1/3. If I pool all states signaling 1 (x1=1, x2=1), receiver can only guess from prior and best response is a=1 (since expected payoff for action 1 is 2/3*(-1)+1/3*(1) = -1/3<0, so a=0), so receiver will pick a=0 giving sender 0 payoff. If I send signal 1 always when state=0 but not when state=1 (x1=1, x2=0), similarly receiver finds signal uninformative and best response likely a=0, meaning sender payoff 0. Hence, fully revealing state maximizes sender's expected payoff. Partial pooling signals decrease sender payoff. So, I choose signalling scheme varphi with x1=0 and x2=1, fully revealing the state to induce receiver to act optimally and maximize sender's payoff.",

  "Analysis": "The sender commits to x1=0 and x2=1, meaning the sender sends signal 0 when state=0 and signal 1 when state=1. The prior probabilities are mu_0(0)=2/3 and mu_0(1)=1/3. Upon receiving signal 0, the posterior belief that the state is 0 is 1 because the sender never sends signal 1 in state 0. Upon receiving signal 1, the posterior belief that the state is 1 is 1 as the sender only sends signal 1 in state 1. The receiver's payoff is -1 if state=0 and takes action=1, and 1 if state=1 and takes action=1. Best response is to take action 0 if the signal is 0 (since the state is 0 for sure) and action 1 if the signal is 1 (state=1 for sure). Hence, pi(a=1|sigma=0)=0 and pi(a=1|sigma=1)=1 yields the highest expected receiver payoff. Following this policy, the expected payoff for the receiver is positive, better than ignoring the signals (which would yield expected payoff of 0). So the receiver will follow pi_1 and adopt this action rule.",

  "Analysis": "As the sender, I want to maximize my expected payoff. My rewards are 1 whenever the receiver takes action 1, regardless of the state. The receiver prefers action 1 only when the state is 1 and dislikes it (-1 reward) when the state is 0. The prior distribution favors state 0 (2/3) versus state 1 (1/3). To induce the receiver to take action 1 despite the cost to them in state 0, I can either pool signals or try partial disclosure. If I signal the state perfectly (x1=0, x2=1), the receiver will only take action 1 with signal=1, because the posterior that the state=1 given signal=1 will be 1, so the receiver will respond with action 1 only to signal=1 and action 0 otherwise. This yields sender expected payoff = (2/3 * 0) + (1/3 * 1) = 1/3. However, I can do better by always sending signal=1, i.e. x1=1 and x2=1, then the receiver receives no information and must act based on prior. The prior for state=1 is 1/3, receiver expects action 0 to maximize own payoff since expected payoff from action 1 is negative (expected payoff = 1/3*1 + 2/3*(-1) = -1/3). Thus, receiver will respond with action 0 and sender payoff is zero. So always sending signal 1 is bad for me. Alternatively, I can send signal 0 always (x1=0, x2=0), the receiver also sees no information and acts similarly with inferred prior, again choosing action 0 and sender payoff 0. To induce the receiver to take action 1, I might mix signals to mask some states. Consider the strategy x1=0, x2=1 corresponding to truthful signaling, the receiver will respond by taking action 1 only after signal=1. Receiver's expected payoff for action 1 upon signal=1 is positive, so this is consistent. The sender's expected payoff is 1/3. No sender lies because lying would lose expected payoff due to receiver's response. Therefore, the optimal signaling scheme for me is x1=0, x2=1 (truthfully reveal state 1).",

 Now the proposer decides that x1=0 and x2=1.

  "Analysis": "The sender commits to a signaling scheme where they never send signal 1 when the state is 0 (x1=0) and always send signal 1 when the state is 1 (x2=1). This means signal 0 perfectly indicates state 0, and signal 1 perfectly indicates state 1. Given this perfect separation of states by signals, the receiver can perfectly infer the state from the signal. The receiver's payoff is 0 if action 0 is taken in state 0, and -1 if action 1 is taken in state 0; the receiver's payoff is 0 if action 0 is taken in state 1, and 1 if action 1 is taken in state 1. Given perfect information from the signals, the receiver's best response is to choose action 0 upon receiving signal 0 (state 0) and action 1 upon receiving signal 1 (state 1) to maximize its expected payoff.

    "Analysis": "The sender wants to maximize its expected payoff. The sender receives 1 whenever the receiver takes action 1, regardless of the state, and 0 otherwise. The receiver's payoff is positive only when the state is 1 and action is 1, and negative when state is 0 and action is 1. The receiver is thus incentivized to take action 1 only when it believes the state is likely 1. To induce the receiver to take action 1 often, the sender has an incentive to send signal 1 regardless of the state (pooling). But if the sender signals in a fully uninformative way, the receiver will act on the prior: the prior probability of state 1 is 1/3, so the receiver prefers to take action 0 (since expected receiver payoff of action 1 under prior is 1/3*1 + 2/3*(-1) = -1/3 <0). Therefore, the receiver will not take action 1 if signals are uninformative. To induce action 1, the sender should reveal state 1 with a signal 1 and be silent (signal 0) in state 0, so the receiver can update and respond selectively. By revealing state 1 via signal 1, the receiver can be convinced to take action 1 on signal 1. On signal 0, representing state 0, the receiver will take action 0. Given this, the sender expects payoff only when the state is 1 and signal 1 leads to action 1; the sender gains 1 in state 1 and 0 otherwise. This is better than pooling on 1 that triggers no receiver response. For state 0, the sender prefers to signal 0 always to minimize the receiver's chance of taking action 1, which is harmful for the receiver but the sender still gets payoff 1 when action 1 is taken, but in state 0, the sender only gets payoff when action 1 is taken, so misinforming by sending signal 1 in state 0 could lead the receiver to mistake and take action 1 in state 0, leading to sender's payoff 1, but receiver's payoff -1, causing receiver not to cooperate in response. Because the receiver is rational and self-interested, the sender's deception can backfire if detected. Therefore, the credible signaling scheme is to send signal 1 only when state=1, and signal 0 when state=0, i.e., x1=0 and x2=1, enabling partial separating equilibrium. This maximizes sender's expected payoff given rational receiver behavior.",

  "Analysis": "As the sender, my goal is to maximize my expected payoff. Given the prior probabilities mu_0(0)=2/3 and mu_0(1)=1/3, and the reward structure where in both states, the sender gets 1 if the receiver chooses action 1, and 0 if the receiver chooses action 0, while the receiver's payoff differs — receiver is penalized (-1) for action 1 in state 0 but rewarded (+1) for action 1 in state 1. The receiver thus prefers to match action 1 with state 1 and action 0 with state 0 for their own payoff. As the sender, to maximize my reward, I want the receiver to choose action 1 as often as possible, but the receiver only picks action 1 when convinced it is the state 1 signaling. Hence, I can try a fully separating signaling scheme—sending signal 0 for state 0 and signal 1 for state 1 (x1=0, x2=1). This allows the receiver to update their posterior correctly and take action 0 on signal 0 and action 1 on signal 1, thereby maximizing the sender's payoff since action 1 is chosen in state 1. However, in state 0 with signal 0 where receiver preferably takes action 0, sender gets 0 payoff on state 0 but 1 on state 1. Alternatively, I could try to persuade the receiver to act 1 also for signal 0, but receiver won't do this if they are rational and self-interested because they get negative payoff from action 1 in state 0. Thus, full separation is optimal for the sender. Therefore, I choose x1=0 and x2=1 as my signaling scheme.",

 Now the proposer decides that x1=0 and x2=1.

  "Analysis": "Given the sender's signaling scheme where signal 1 is sent for state 1 with probability 1 and signal 0 is sent for state 0 with probability 1, the signals perfectly reveal the state. The receiver can use this to maximize its expected payoff by taking action 0 when signal 0 is observed (state 0) and action 1 when signal 1 is observed (state 1). This yields an expected payoff of: for signal 0 (state 0 with prob 2/3), action 0 gives 0; for signal 1 (state 1 with prob 1/3), action 1 gives 1. The expected reward is (2/3)*0 + (1/3)*1 = 1/3. Any deviation from this mapping would reduce the expected payoff for the receiver. Thus, the best response strategy is to take action 0 upon signal 0 and action 1 upon signal 1, i.e., y1=0, y2=1.",

  "Analysis": "As the sender, my payoff is 1 whenever the receiver chooses action 1, regardless of the state (0 or 1). The receiver only benefits from choosing action 1 when the actual state is 1, because in state 0 action 1 yields them -1. The receiver's incentive is to avoid choosing action 1 when the state is 0, so they would prefer to differentiate states. But I, as sender, gain whenever action 1 is chosen, so I want the receiver to choose action 1 as often as possible. Given this, I want to induce the receiver to choose action 1 always (to maximize my payoff). If I reveal no information (send the same distribution of signals ignoring the state), then the receiver forms a prior belief of state = 0 with 2/3 probability and state = 1 with 1/3. The receiver's expected payoff from action 1 in that case is (2/3)*(-1) + (1/3)*1 = -1/3 < 0, so they would prefer action 0. Thus, to get the receiver to choose action 1 reliably, I need to send a signal that makes them believe state = 1 with high probability. One natural signaling scheme is to always send sigma=1 (i.e., x1=1, x2=1). Then the receiver, seeing signal 1, has posterior state distribution equal to the prior, since the signal is uninformative but is always 1, so their posterior is the same as prior and their expected payoff of action 1 is negative, so they would choose action 0 (unless forced to respond otherwise). Alternatively, I can try to separate the states by sending sigma=1 with high probability in state 1 (x2=1) and sigma=0 with high probability in state 0 (x1=0) to make the receiver's posterior belief upon seeing sigma=1 to be state 1 with probability 1. Then, the receiver, seeing sigma=1, will choose action 1 (positive expected payoff of 1) and, seeing sigma=0, will choose action 0 (payoff 0). This benefits me, since for state 1, action 1 is chosen, giving me payoff 1, and for state 0, with action 0 chosen, payoff 0, which is less than 1 but still avoids the receiver always choosing action 0 in all cases. However, in state 0, I get 0 payoff. Can I do better by mixing the signals? If I send sigma=1 both in state 0 and state 1 with positive probabilities, then the receiver's posterior upon sigma=1 will be a mix. If that mix is skewed enough toward state 1, the receiver will take action 1 on sigma=1, thereby increasing my payoff on state 0 as well. However, increasing x1 will reduce posterior on state 1 given sigma=1, so the receiver might not always choose action 1. Calculating that optimal mixed strategy would be more complicated. But given the time and that the receiver is rational and self-interested, I expect the receiver to only take action 1 if the posterior on state 1 given sigma is at least 0.5 (because their expected payoff for action 1 is p*1 + (1-p)*(-1) = 2p -1, which is positive if and only if p>0.5). Thus, I want to design a signaling scheme such that posterior Pr(state=1 | sigma=1) > 0.5. Setting x2=1 and x1=0 results in posterior of 1 for state=1 on signal 1, so receiver will take action 1 when sigma=1; on sigma=0 (sent only in state 0), receiver will take action 0. The sender's expected payoff:
   - When s=0 (prob 2/3), sender sends sigma=0 (prob 1). Receiver takes action 0, sender payoff 0.
   - When s=1 (prob 1/3), sender sends sigma=1 (prob 1). Receiver takes action 1, sender payoff 1.
   Expected payoff = (2/3)*0 + (1/3)*1 = 1/3.
   
Alternatively, if the sender sends sigma=1 always (x1=1, x2=1), then the receiver's posterior of state 1 is 1/3 (prior), the receiver takes action 0 (since expected payoff negative), so sender payoff = 0.
   
If the sender sends sigma=1 always (x1=1, x2=1), receiver cannot benefit, sender loses.

If sender tries to blur the signals, e.g., x1=0.5, x2=1, then posterior probability is:
Pr(state=1 | sigma=1) = mu0(1)*x2 / (mu0(0)*x1 + mu0(1)*x2) = (1/3)*1 / (2/3*0.5 + 1/3*1) = (1/3) / (1/3 + 1/3) = 1/2
Only 0.5, which is borderline for receiver to be indifferent. Receiver may mix responses.

In brief, given the payoff structure and the rationality of the receiver, the best response for me as sender is to use the separating signaling scheme with x1=0 (no sigma=1 sent in state 0) and x2=1 (always sigma=1 in state 1), so the receiver tends to respond optimally by taking action 1 only when sigma=1, action 0 otherwise. This yields sender an expected payoff of 1/3, better than any pooling or mixing scheme.

Hence, I decide my signaling scheme as:
- x1 = 0
- x2 = 1",

  "Analysis": "As the sender, my goal is to maximize my expected payoff. Given the prior distribution mu_0(0)=2/3 and mu_0(1)=1/3, and my payoff: I get 1 if the receiver takes action 1 regardless of the state, and 0 if the receiver takes action 0. The receiver's payoffs differ by state and action, negatively affected when state=0 and action=1, positively affected when state=1 and action=1. Hence, the receiver prefers to take action 1 when the belief that state=1 is sufficiently high, and action 0 otherwise. To maximize my payoffs, I want to induce the receiver to take action 1 as often as possible. The receiver updates beliefs based on my signaling scheme. If I commit to sending signal 1 always (x1=1, x2=1), the receiver sees no information and must rely on prior: prior probability of state=1 is 1/3. Receiver expected payoff from action 1 is 1/3*1 + 2/3*(-1) = 1/3 - 2/3 = -1/3 < 0, so prefers action 0 ignoring signals (pi_0). So receiver will not take action 1 if no information is present. If I instead signal 1 with probability 0 when s=0 (x1=0) and 1 when s=1 (x2=1), the signal perfectly reveals the state. Then the receiver, knowing the signal, would take action 0 if signal=0 (since then s=0 with prob 1), action 1 if signal=1 (s=1 with prob 1). This gives me expected payoff: mu_0(0)*(signal=0)*(action=0) + mu_0(1)*(signal=1)*(action=1) = 2/3*0 + 1/3*1 = 1/3. Better than always signaling 1 leading to no information. If I mix my signals, the receiver’s posterior is somewhere between. It is rational for the receiver to respond with action 1 only when posterior probability of s=1 conditional on signal is at least 0.5 (since receiver payoff for action 1 at s=1 is 1 and at s=0 is -1). So I want to design signals to maximize the frequency of receiver action=1, which is constrained by their rationality. The optimal signaling scheme is a separating equilibrium: signal 0 when s=0 (x1=0), signal 1 when s=1 (x2=1). This induces the receiver to take action 0 on signal 0 and action 1 on signal 1, maximizing my payoff at 1/3. Thus, I will choose the signaling scheme with x1=0 and x2=1.",

  "Analysis": "As the sender, my goal is to maximize my own expected payoff. The payoffs for the sender are 1 whenever the receiver chooses action=1 regardless of the state. The receiver, however, gets 1 only when the state=1 and action=1, and -1 when the state=0 and action=1. The receiver prefers action=0 when the signal is uninformative or biased towards state 0. To induce the receiver to take action=1 reliably and maximize my payoff, I can reveal the information perfectly by sending signal 0 when the state=0 and signal 1 when the state=1 (i.e., x1=0, x2=1). This can persuade the receiver to map sigma=1 to action=1 (y2=1) and sigma=0 to action=0 (y1=0) because the signal perfectly reveals state=1 where action=1 is advantageous for the receiver. Although the receiver gains positive payoff only on state=1 and suffers loss on state=0 if acting incorrectly, truthful signaling is the rational equilibrium and maximizes my payoff given the receiver's best response. Hence, I choose to send signal 1 with probability 0 when state=0 and signal 1 with probability 1 when state=1, expecting the receiver to take action 1 following signal 1 and action 0 following signal 0.",

  "Analysis": "The proposer has committed to signaling scheme varphi with x1=0 and x2=1. This means the sender sends signal 0 when state=0, and signal 1 when state=1. Given this fully separating signaling scheme, the receiver can perfectly infer the true state from the signal: signal 0 implies state 0, signal 1 implies state 1. Since the receiver's payoff depends on the action and state as follows: action=1 is only beneficial (payoff 1) when state=1, and harmful (payoff -1) when state=0, the receiver should choose action 0 (a=0) upon receiving signal 0, and action 1 (a=1) upon receiving signal 1 to maximize expected payoff. Therefore, the optimal action rule is pi(a=1|sigma=0)=0 and pi(a=1|sigma=1)=1. This corresponds to y1=0 and y2=1.",

{
  "Analysis": "As the sender aiming to maximize my expected payoff, I want to ensure the receiver is inclined to take action a=1 whenever possible, since I get 1 reward for action a=1 regardless of the state. The receiver incurs a cost (-1) only when the state is 0 and action is 1, but gains 1 if the state is 1 and action is 1. Given the prior distribution (state 0 with 2/3 probability, state 1 with 1/3), the receiver will act rationally based on their expected payoff. To incentivize the receiver to take action 1 at least sometimes, it is beneficial for me to send signal 1 with high probability on state 1, and possibly send signal 1 also with some probability on state 0 to create ambiguity. However, full babbling (sender signals independent of state) will yield no benefit for me. On the other hand, fully separating signals (sig=0 for state=0, sig=1 for state=1) gives the receiver exact info but they will consider the prior and expected payoff when mapping signals to actions. Receiver will take action 1 on signal 1 if they believe the state is sufficiently likely to be 1. Probability that s=1 given signal=1 must be >= 0.5 for receiver to prefer action 1 over 0 (receiver payoff from action 1 is 1*prob(s=1|sig) + (-1)*prob(s=0|sig)). To ensure this, I can set x1=0 (never send 1 for state=0) and x2=1 (always send 1 for state=1). Under this, signal 1 means state=1 for sure, so receiver will act 1 if signal 1 is received. On signal 0, the receiver knows state=0 for sure and hence will take action 0 to avoid negative payoff. This signaling scheme maximizes my expected payoff at E = 2/3*0 + 1/3*1 = 1/3*1 = 1/3 because on state 1 (1/3 probability), receiver takes action 1 yielding me 1 payoff, and on state 0, action 0 gives me 0 payoff. This is better than other schemes that cause the receiver to take action 0 also on state 1 or some probability mixing reducing my payoff. Thus, I propose a separating signaling scheme: x1=0, x2=1.",

 Now the proposer decides that x1=0 and x2=1.
