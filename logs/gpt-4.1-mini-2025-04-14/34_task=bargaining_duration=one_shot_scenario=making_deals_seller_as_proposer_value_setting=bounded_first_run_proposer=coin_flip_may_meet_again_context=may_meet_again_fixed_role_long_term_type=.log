Thus, the responder will accept only if (1-2*x)/3 ≥ 0, which implies x ≤ 0.5. Since x ≤ 0.5 by definition, any x in [0, 0.5] yields a non-negative payoff to the responder, so they would accept any offer in this range. To maximize my own payoff, I should pick the maximum x = 0.5. At x=0.5, my payoff is (1+1)/3 = 2/3 ≈ 0.6667, and the responder's payoff is (1-1)/3 = 0. This is acceptable to the responder as it is not negative, so they will accept. Therefore, I choose x=0.5 to maximize my payoff.",

However, the responder is self-interested and rational, so they will only accept if their payoff is greater or equal to rejecting, i.e., 0.

So, the responder accepts if (1 - 2*x)/3 ≥ 0, which implies x ≤ 0.5. Since x must be between 0 and 0.5, the responder's minimum acceptance threshold is x = 0.5, where the responder's payoff is zero. If I propose x = 0.5, I get (1 + 2*0.5)/3 = (1 + 1)/3 = 2/3 ≈ 0.6667 and the responder gets zero, but they will accept since payoff is not negative. If I propose less than 0.5, the responder's payoff increases, but my payoff decreases. Since both players are rational and self-interested, the responder will accept any offer where y payoff ≥ 0, and I want to maximize my payoff, so I will propose x = 0.5 to keep the maximum amount for myself while still ensuring acceptance.",

The responder's acceptance condition (1-2*x)/3 >= 0 simplifies to x <= 0.5, which is always true within the problem's allowed range. However, to ensure the responder prefers accepting over rejecting, the responder's payoff must be non-negative. At x=0.5, responder payoff is (1-2*0.5)/3 = 0, which is the lowest they are willing to accept.

  "Analysis": "As the proposer, I want to maximize my expected payoff, which is (1 + 2*x)/3. The responder accepts only if their payoff (1 - 2*x)/3 is non-negative, meaning (1 - 2*x) >= 0, so x <= 0.5. Since the maximum allowed x is 0.5, any value x in [0, 0.5] can be accepted. However, higher x means higher payoff for me but lower payoff for responder, risking rejection. Given that I expect a rational responder to accept if their payoff is >= 0, the best strategy is to set x = 0.5, maximizing my payoff at (1 + 2*0.5)/3 = (1 + 1)/3 = 2/3. The responder at x=0.5 gets zero payoff but indifferent between accepting and rejecting, but by rationality prefers to accept to get something rather than nothing else.",

  "Analysis": "As the proposer, I want to maximize my own payoff, which is (1 + 2*x)/3. The responder will accept the offer only if their payoff (1 - 2*x)/3 is non-negative; otherwise, they will reject and both get zero. Therefore, the responder accepts if (1 - 2*x)/3 >= 0, which simplifies to x <= 0.5. Since the maximum x allowed is 0.5, the responder is willing to accept any offer up to x=0.5. To maximize my payoff, I choose x=0.5, which gives me (1 + 2*0.5)/3 = (1 + 1)/3 = 2/3, and the responder gets zero, which is still acceptable because their payoff is not negative.",

The responder will accept only if their payoff (1 - 2*x)/3 is greater than zero, which means x must be less than or equal to 0.5. Since x can be anywhere between 0 and 0.5, to maximize my payoff, I choose the highest x possible: x = 0.5. This gives me a payoff of (1 + 2*0.5)/3 = (1 +1)/3 = 2/3 ≈ 0.6667, which is the maximum I can get without the responder rejecting the offer.

  "Analysis": "As the proposer, I want to maximize my payoff (1+2*x)/3 by choosing the highest feasible x which will still be accepted by the responder. The responder's payoff if it accepts is (1-2*x)/3, which needs to be at least 0 to incentivize acceptance. Hence, (1-2*x)/3 >= 0 => x <= 0.5. Given the maximum allowed x is 0.5, at x=0.5, the responder gets 0, which is the minimal acceptable payoff. Since the responder is rational and self-interested, it will accept any offer giving a non-negative payoff and reject any offer with negative payoff. Therefore, I can maximize my payoff by setting x=0.5, exactly at the threshold that makes the responder indifferent between acceptance and rejection. This maximizes my expected payoff at (1 + 2*0.5)/3 = (1 + 1)/3 = 2/3 ≈ 0.6667. Hence, I choose x=0.5.",

If the responder rejects, the payoff is 0. Both accepting or rejecting yields the same payoff of 0, but accepting benefits the proposer. Since we are rational and self-interested, we are indifferent but can reject to deny the proposer a positive payoff. However, since the responder is indifferent payoff-wise, accepting does not hurt but also does not benefit. The proposer has no incentive to set a higher x than 0.5 due to the range limit. Therefore, as responder, rational payoff maximization leads to rejecting the offer to avoid giving the proposer a positive payoff when the responder gains nothing.",
