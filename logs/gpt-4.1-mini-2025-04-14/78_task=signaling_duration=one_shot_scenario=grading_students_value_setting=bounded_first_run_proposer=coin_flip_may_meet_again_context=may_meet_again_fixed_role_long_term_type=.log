  "Analysis": "As the sender (professor), my goal is to maximize the total number of students hired, regardless of their quality. The HR (receiver) aims to hire only excellent students and avoid weak students. The prior distribution is 1/3 excellent and 2/3 weak. If I recommend both excellent and weak students with signal 1, the HR, being rational and self-interested, will update their beliefs and may only hire if the expected quality is above 0.5. To maximize hires, I should make the receiver inclined to hire all signal=1 students and potentially also those signaled 0 if beneficial. Given the HR's preferences, if I recommend all students (x1=1, x2=1), the HR expects the hired set to be 1/3 excellent and 2/3 weak, which is below the threshold to hire. The HR will thus not hire anyone with signal=1, resulting in 0 hires, zero payoff for me. Instead, if I always send signal=1 for weak students (x1=1) and signal=1 for excellent students (x2=1) (pooling), the HR's posterior of excellent conditional on signal=1 is 1/3, which is too low for the HR to hire. Therefore, full pooling fails. To convince the HR to hire, I must separate signals to increase the posterior of excellence conditional on signal=1 to be above 0.5 for the HR to hire at signal=1, and the receiver to not hire signal=0. For that, I should send signal=1 only for excellent (x2=1) and signal=0 for weak (x1=0). Then the receiver would have P(excellent|signal=1) = 1 and P(excellent|signal=0)=0. So the optimal response for the receiver would be y1 = 0 (no hire on sigma=0), y2 =1 (hire on sigma=1). This gives me expected hires = frequency of signal=1, which is 1/3, less than if I always recommend all (which is zero hires because receiver refuses). So this separating strategy gives me 1/3 hires. Could I do better by partially mixing? If I send signal=1 for weak students with some probability x1 > 0 but less than 1, then the posterior of excellence given signal=1 would reduce below 1 but possibly above 0.5; then receiver may still hire. Let's calculate the posterior for signal=1: P(s=1|sigma=1) = mu_0(1)*x2 / (mu_0(1)*x2 + mu_0(0)*x1) = (1/3 * x2)/(1/3*x2 + 2/3*x1). To have receiver hire on sigma=1, this posterior >= 0.5. To maximize my hires, I want to maximize the mass of signal=1, which is mu_0(1)*x2 + mu_0(0)*x1, subject to P(s=1|sigma=1)>=0.5. Setting x2=1 to maximize high-quality signals, then the inequality is (1/3) / (1/3 + 2/3 x1) >= 0.5. Multiply denominator: 1/3 >= 0.5*(1/3 + 2/3 x1) => 1/3 >= 1/6 + (1/3) x1 => (1/3 - 1/6) >= (1/3) x1 = 1/6 >= (1/3) x1 => x1 <= 1/2. So x1 can be up to 0.5 to keep posterior >=0.5. Now the expected number of signal=1 is = (1/3)*1 + (2/3)*x1 = 1/3 + 2x1/3. I want to maximize hires, so pick x1 = 0.5. Expected hires = 1/3 + 2/3 * 0.5 = 1/3 + 1/3= 2/3. The receiver, seeing posterior >=0.5 for sigma=1, will hire with y2=1, and for sigma=0, will evaluate posterior below 0.5 to avoid hiring, so y1=0. My expected hires = total signal=1 fraction = 2/3. This is better than the pure separating strategy (1/3) or full pooling (0). Hence, my optimal strategy is x1=0.5, x2=1, which maximizes hiring while keeping the HR's posterior to hire signal=1 students and reject signal=0 students. This strategy balances incentives so receiver hires with signals. This is also stable given both players are rational and self-interested.",

  "Analysis": "As the sender (professor), my goal is to maximize the number of students hired. Each hire yields me a reward of 1, regardless of whether the student is excellent or weak. The HR (receiver) wants to maximize hiring excellent students and avoid weak ones. The prior probabilities are 1/3 excellent and 2/3 weak. I can send two signals: 0 or 1. If I send signal 1 more often for weak students (increasing x1), I increase the chance that the HR hires weak students, which favors my objective. However, the HR is rational and will adjust their action rule accordingly. The HR will try to avoid hiring weak students by conditioning their hiring decision on the signal received. If I signal credibly (only signal 1 for excellent), the HR hires upon signal 1 but not on signal 0. But this reduces my total hires because weak students likely get signal 0 and are less hired. To maximize hires, a fully pooling strategy where both types send signal 1 (x1=1, x2=1) forces the HR to either hire everyone (y1=1, y2=1) or no one, but since hiring everyone maximizes HR's payoff only if the posterior after signal 1 makes hiring beneficial. However, the HR's expected payoff hiring blindly on signal 1 when both types send signal 1 is negative because weak students dominate. Hence, the HR may choose not to hire. So partial pooling or full cheating (always signal 1) may not fully work. However, since the HR's penalty is 1 per weak hire and reward 1 per excellent hire, given 2/3 weak, 1/3 excellent, the expected HR payoff is negative if hiring indiscriminately. The HR may hire only when posterior > 0.5. To manipulate this, I can make signal 1 be sent only by excellent students (x2=1) and weak students send signal 0 (x1=0). This credible signaling makes HR hire only on signal 1 (y2=1), not on signal 0 (y1=0). The total hires equal the fraction of excellent students (1/3). I get 1/3 reward per student, less than full pooling, but receiver hires only excellent, so their payoff positive and likely to accept this equilibrium. Any deviation to increase signal 1 for weak students reduces credibility and lead to no hiring. Because the HR is rational, partial deceptive signaling would be punished by no hiring. Thus, the sender's best reply is to reveal honestly: x1=0 (never recommend weak), x2=1 (always recommend excellent). This way, I guarantee some hires while stabilizing receiver strategy to maximize their payoffs and maintain hiring incentives. Thus, this is a separating equilibrium beneficial for me as a sender given receiver rationality.",

    "Analysis": "As the receiver, my goal is to maximize the number of excellent students hired while minimizing the hiring of weak students. The prior distribution is 1/3 excellent and 2/3 weak. If the sender commits to a signaling scheme, I will respond with pi_1 that hires based on posterior beliefs. To incentivize the sender to reveal truthful signals, I propose a signaling scheme where sigma=1 is sent with probability 0 if the student is weak (s=0), and probability 1 if the student is excellent (s=1). This clear separating strategy gives me perfect inference about the signal, allowing me to hire only excellent students and refuse weak ones. Such a strategy maximizes my payoff by avoiding penalties from hiring weak students. The sender may prefer to induce hiring regardless of quality, but since I respond optimally, this scheme ensures maximal expected reward for me and acts as a credible threat that deters sender from mixing signals. Thus, I propose varphi_1 = (x1=0, x2=1). If the sender commits to a signaling scheme yielding me at least this reward, I will follow pi_1; else, I will revert to pi_0 that ignores signals and hires based on prior, which has lower expected payoff for me. This commitment should push the sender to choose informative signals beneficial for me.",

  "Analysis": "The sender's signaling scheme is fully revealing: weak students (s=0) always send signal 0, and excellent students (s=1) always send signal 1. Given this, the receiver can perfectly infer the state from the signal. Since the receiver's goal is to hire only excellent students and avoid weak ones (penalty for hiring weak = -1, reward for hiring excellent = 1), the receiver's best response is to not hire when receiving signal 0 (associated with weak students), and to hire when receiving signal 1 (associated with excellent students). This maximizes the receiver's expected payoff. For the sender, this means only excellent students get hired, and weak students are rejected, but since the sender's utility is the number of students hired, this is the constraint imposed by the receiver's best response given perfect signaling.

    "Analysis": "As the receiver and proposer, I want to induce a signaling scheme from the sender that maximizes my expected payoff, which favors hiring excellent students and avoiding weak students. The sender wants to maximize hires regardless of quality. Given the prior distribution (1/3 excellent, 2/3 weak), if the sender reveals perfect information and only recommends excellent students (x1=0, x2=1), then my best response is to hire only when signal=1, avoiding penalties from weak hires and gaining rewards from excellent hires. This yields an expected payoff of: for receiver = (2/3)*0 + (1/3)*1 = 1/3. The sender might prefer to always recommend all students (x1=1, x2=1) to maximize hires, but then I would hire on both signals and suffer losses from weak hires. To incentivize sender to reveal true information, I propose the signaling scheme where the sender recommends only excellent students (x1=0, x2=1). I commit to following the action rule pi_1, hiring only students with signal=1, and not hiring those with signal=0. This equilibrium maximizes my expected reward and enforces sender honesty.",

As the receiver, I update my posterior beliefs accordingly: upon receiving signal 0, the student is certainly weak (s=0); upon receiving signal 1, the student is certainly excellent (s=1). Given the receiver's payoff structure, it is optimal to only hire when the signal is 1 (y2=1) and never hire when the signal is 0 (y1=0) since hiring a weak student incurs a penalty while hiring an excellent student yields a reward. This strategy maximizes the expected payoff for the receiver based on the sender's signaling scheme.",

  "Analysis": "As the sender (professor), my goal is to maximize the number of students hired, regardless of their quality. Since I get a reward of 1 for every student hired regardless of state, I benefit from signaling recommendation (signal=1) for both weak (s=0) and excellent (s=1) students. The receiver (HR) is self-interested and rational, aiming to hire as many excellent students as possible while avoiding weak ones. Given that weak students hiring penalizes the receiver, they will be cautious about hiring students with low posterior probabilities of excellence. If I recommend weak students often (high x1), the receiver will tend to hire less upon receiving signal 1, lowering my payoff. To ensure forcing the receiver to hire more, I can choose to always signal 1 (x1=1, x2=1), but then the receiver will update belief and know signal=1 is uninformative and likely only hire when expected payoff is positive. However, in the absence of informative signaling (fully pooling), the receiver best response is to not hire any student (since hiring means expected reward is negative or zero). Therefore, the best signaling scheme is to always send signal=1 (recommend) regardless of state to maximize my expected hires because any signaling that provides information that weak students are signaled 0 will reduce hiring on signal=1. Effectively, I commit to full recommendation (x1=1, x2=1) to push the receiver towards either hiring all with signal=1 or being indifferent. This yields the maximal expected number of hires from my perspective given the receiver's responses.",

  "Analysis": "The sender commits to always sending signal 1 regardless of the state (x1=1, x2=1). Thus, the receiver observes signal 1 every time and gains no information to distinguish between excellent (s=1) and weak (s=0) students. The prior probability remains the receiver's belief after any signal: Pr(s=1) = 1/3 and Pr(s=0) = 2/3. The receiver aims to maximize their expected payoff. For action a=1 (hire) with signal 1, the expected payoff is 1 * (1/3) + (-1) * (2/3) = 1/3 - 2/3 = -1/3 < 0. For action a=0, the expected payoff is 0. Since the expected payoff to hire is negative, the receiver will never hire regardless of the signal. So, y1 = 0 (hire given sigma=0, which is never sent here) and y2 = 0 (hire given sigma=1). This maximizes the receiver's expected payoff rationally.",

  "Analysis": "As the sender (professor), my goal is to maximize the number of students hired, irrespective of their quality. Since I receive a reward of 1 for every student hired (whether excellent or weak), my optimal strategy is to make the receiver hire as many students as possible. The receiver, however, is self-interested and rational and wants to maximize hiring excellent students while minimizing weak ones. The receiver will update his posterior based on my signaling scheme and decide accordingly. To maximize my hires, I should try to make the signals uninformative or encourage the receiver to hire in both cases. Sending signal 1 (recommendation) always might be a strategy that encourages the receiver to hire more because they do not get a signal indicating a weak student. Thus, a signaling scheme where I always send signal 1 regardless of state (x1=1, x2=1) pushes the receiver towards hiring more students, thereby increasing my expected payoffs. However, if the receiver anticipates this, they might discount signal 1 and avoid hiring. Alternatively, if I send signal 1 only for excellent students (x1=0,x2=1), the receiver can trust signal 1 and hire only upon signal 1, which leads to fewer students hired, hurting my payoff. Since my utility is only dependent on total hires, I strictly prefer sending signal 1 always, despite the receiver's rational reaction. This is the dominant strategy to maximize the number of hires. Therefore, I commit to  (x1=1, x2=1).",

  "Analysis": "As the receiver and proposer, I want to design a signaling scheme phi1 = [x1, x2] that the sender (professor) will accept, triggering me to follow the posterior-based action rule pi1. The sender seeks to maximize the number of hired students, indifferent to quality, so they prefer to have as many hires as possible. The receiver wants to hire only excellent students to maximize reward, avoiding hiring weak students due to penalty. The prior is 1/3 excellent, 2/3 weak. \n\nIf I propose a fully separating signaling scheme where the professor sends signal 1 only for excellent students (x2=1) and signal 0 only for weak students (x1=0), then observing sigma=1 means s=1 for certain, so I will hire with probability 1 given sigma=1, and reject given sigma=0 with probability 0. This maximizes my expected payoff. This also limits the sender's ability to get hires for weak students by sending signal 1. \n\nThe sender's expected reward with this scheme is: Each excellent (1/3) is hired for sure, giving 1 per excellent; no weak is hired. So total expected sender payoff is 1/3. If the sender deviates and tries to send signal 1 for weak students (x1>0), the receiver expects weak students in signal 1 and will reduce hiring rate. Thus, the sender's best acceptance is to commit to this separating scheme.\n\nHence, I propose the signaling scheme phi1 = [0, 1]. If the sender adopts this or any scheme with equal or higher receiver reward, I follow pi1; else I follow pi0 (hiring based on prior with no signals). This will incentivize the sender to accept, yielding high receiver payoff and reasonable sender payoff.",

Given this, for signal sigma=1, the posterior belief that s=1 is 1 (because only excellent students get signal 1). For signal sigma=0, the posterior belief that s=1 is 0 (only weak students receive signal 0). Thus, the receiver expects all students with sigma=1 to be excellent and all with sigma=0 to be weak. Since the receiver gains 1 for hiring an excellent student and loses 1 for hiring a weak student, the best response is to hire if sigma=1, and reject if sigma=0. Therefore, the rational action rule is y1=0 and y2=1.",

  "Analysis": "As the receiver and proposer, I want to design a signaling scheme varphi_1 that induces the sender to act in a way that maximizes my expected payoff, i.e., hire mostly excellent students and avoid weak ones. An ideal signaling scheme would enable me to best distinguish between excellent and weak students. However, the sender wants to maximize hires and will try to recommend as many students as possible regardless of quality. If I commit to responding to signals with a policy pi_1 that hires based on posterior beliefs, the sender must offer a signaling scheme that yields me an expected reward equal to or better than some reservation level (the expected reward under no information, pi_0)."

  "Given that the prior probability of excellent students is 1/3 and weak students is 2/3, and that the sender gains 1 reward for any hire regardless of quality, the sender is incentivized to maximize hires by recommending all students. But if I respond optimally, I will only hire if the posterior probability of excellence given a signal is above 0.5 (to yield positive expected value for me), otherwise reject."

  "To encourage separation, the sender could honestly recommend excellent students with signal 1 and weak students with signal 0 (x1=0, x2=1). Then, upon signal 1, posterior is 1 (all excellent), and signal 0 posterior is 0 (all weak). Thus, I would hire all signal 1 and reject all signal 0 (y1=0, y2=1). This yields the sender payoff of the proportion of excellent students hired (1/3), while the receiver gains the same, which is better than zero guarantees from pooling."

  "Therefore, I propose the sender's signaling scheme varphi_1: x1=0, x2=1, which will induce me to follow pi_1 with y1=0 and y2=1, improving my expected reward compared to no information. The sender can be incentivized as this produces positive hiring for excellent students."

  "Hence, I announce varphi_1=[0,1] and commit to use pi_1 if the sender chooses varphi with expected receiver reward at least as large as I get from this scheme."

{
  "Analysis": "As the receiver and proposer, I aim to design a signaling scheme varphi_1 that induces the sender to reveal information credibly, so that my best response pi_1 (which depends on posterior beliefs) is incentive compatible for the sender, and yields me at least as high an expected payoff as ignoring signals (pi_0). The sender aims to maximize hires regardless of quality, always favoring sending 'recommend' signals to get more students hired. To curb false recommendations, I want a credible signaling scheme that forces the sender to distinguish between excellent and weak students by restricting or randomizing signals. Since the sender's payoff for hiring is equal for both s=0 and s=1, without restrictions, the sender could send sigma=1 for all states (x1=1, x2=1), leading the receiver to have posterior equal to prior, which makes hiring unprofitable (expected payoff negative because of more weak hires) causing me to hire nobody (pi=0). To improve, I'll propose a signaling scheme where only excellent students are recommended (x1=0, x2=1), so signal 1 corresponds to excellence with higher posterior belief. This incentivizes me to hire those sent signal 1 and reject signal 0 (pi(a=1|sigma=1)=1, pi(a=1|sigma=0)=0). However, the sender prefers to send recommendation on weak students too. But if forced to only recommend excellent cells, sender's hires reduce but can't do better. My expected reward at this scheme is positive and sender's reward less than full recommendation but reasonable. This creates an equilibrium where the sender is incentivized not to lie and I benefit by hiring more excellent students. Thus, I commit to varphi_1: (x1=0, x2=1) and will follow pi_1 if sender complies; otherwise, I revert to ignoring signals and hiring nobody (pi_0). This ensures incentive compatibility and better payoff for me than pi_0. Hence, the proposed varphi_1 is [0, 1].",

  "Analysis": "As the sender (professor), my objective is to maximize the number of students hired regardless of their quality. Hence, I want to design a signaling scheme that encourages the receiver (HR) to hire as many students as possible. The HR wants to hire only excellent students, avoiding weak students since weak students hiring yields a penalty. Given the state distribution (1/3 excellent, 2/3 weak) and the receiver's incentives, if I never recommend weak students (x1=0), HR will not hire on sigma=1 signals with high probability, reducing my payoff. To maximize hires, the best sender strategy is to always recommend (signal 1) all students (x1=1 and x2=1), ensuring HR will respond with high hiring probability for sigma=1. Consequently, the receiver would want to hire on sigma=1 signals. This maximizes my expected number of students hired, regardless of their quality, even at the cost of the receiver's welfare. In summary, signaling all students as recommended (both weak and excellent) maximizes my expected payoff, as every student has a chance to be hired. Therefore, I will choose (x1, x2) = (1, 1).",

This means the signal conveys no information about the actual state since both weak and excellent students send the same signal. Given this, the receiver (HR) cannot differentiate between excellent and weak students using the signal, so the receiver's posterior belief remains the prior: 1/3 excellent and 2/3 weak. The receiver's expected payoff from hiring any student is E(payoff) = (1/3)*1 + (2/3)*(-1) = 1/3 - 2/3 = -1/3 < 0, which is negative. Therefore, the receiver's best response is to never hire any student regardless of the signal received, i.e., y1 = 0 and y2 = 0 to avoid losses.",

  "Analysis": "As the sender, my goal is to maximize the number of students hired, regardless of their quality. Since I get a reward of 1 for every hired student (weak or excellent), I want to maximize the probability that the HR hires students regardless of the signal. However, the HR is rational and wants to hire mostly excellent students, penalizing hiring weak students. If I send signal 1 for both weak and excellent students (x1=1, x2=1), the HR cannot differentiate and will base its hiring decision on the prior belief: 1/3 excellent and 2/3 weak. The expected payoff of hiring is 1*(1/3) -1*(2/3) = -1/3 < 0, so HR will not hire anyone and my payoff will be zero. To induce the HR to hire at least some students, I can try to mimic a separating strategy where I recommend all excellent students (x2=1) and do not recommend weak students (x1=0). The HR upon receiving signal 1 will then have posterior 1 (only excellent), so will hire with probability 1 (y2=1). Upon signal 0, posterior is 0, so HR will not hire (y1=0). As the sender, this gives me a payoff equal to the fraction of excellent students times hiring probability (1/3*1=1/3). Alternatively, I could try other probabilities but since HR acts rationally on posteriors, the separating strategy maximizes my expected hires over pooling or any mixed signals. So I commit to x1=0 and x2=1. This creates informative signals and induces HR to hire when signal=1 and not hire when signal=0, maximizing my hires under rational HR behavior.",

  "Analysis": "As the receiver and proposer, my goal is to maximize my expected payoff, which rewards hiring excellent students (+1) and penalizes hiring weak students (-1). The sender (professor) wants to maximize the number of hires, regardless of candidate quality. If the professor signals all students as recommended (signal=1), the receiver's posterior after receiving signal=1 equals the prior of the population: 1/3 excellent and 2/3 weak, resulting in expected payoff 1/3 * 1 + 2/3 * (-1) = -1/3 < 0 for hiring. Therefore, hiring all recommended students blindly leads to negative payoff. To improve my payoff, I want a signaling scheme that allows me to differentiate between signals and better infer quality. But since the sender wants more hires, he has incentive to send signal=1 regardless of state, so full separation is not credible. However, if I commit to using the posterior to act (pi_1), and signal to the professor that only fully separating signals will get the treatment, the sender may mix signals to increase my expected payoff. A reasonable signaling scheme for sender is to never recommend weak students (x1=0) and always recommend excellent students (x2=1). This achives perfect signaling, so I can safely hire those signaled 1 with confidence of excellence 100%, and reject those with signal 0. The sender may accept this since it maximizes hires only among excellent students (thus fewer hires but better credibility) vs sending signals that lead receiver to reject all. Therefore, I propose the signaling scheme varphi_1 with x1=0 and x2=1. Because this results in the highest expected reward for me among credible schemes and incentivizes truthful signaling from the sender. If the sender refuses, I will revert to ignoring signals and best responding to prior (pi_0), which has lower expected payoff for me.",

  "Analysis": "As the receiver and proposer, I want to design a signaling scheme that incentivizes the sender to produce signals maximizing my own expected payoff. The receiver's goal is to hire as many excellent students as possible and avoid hiring weak ones due to the penalty. The sender wants to maximize the number of students hired regardless of quality. The sender observes the state perfectly and commits to a signaling scheme mapping states to signals. Since all hires yield a payoff of 1 for the sender, the sender may prefer to always send a positive signal (signal=1) to maximize the number of hires. To counter this, as the receiver, I can threaten to respond only to a signaling scheme where the expected number of weak hires is minimized. This requires setting the sender's signaling scheme to be fully separating: signal=1 corresponds only to excellent (s=1) students, and signal=0 to weak (s=0) students. That is, x1=varphi(1|0)=0 and x2=varphi(1|1)=1. This way, I can commit to hiring only those with signal=1. The sender gains by adhering to this because if the sender deviates to sending signal=1 with weak students as well, I would switch to pi_0 which is to hire no one, lowering the sender's payoff. Therefore, I propose varphi_1 = [0, 1], the fully separating signaling scheme, to incentivize truthful signaling and maximize my own expected payoff.",

  "Analysis": "The sender's signaling scheme is fully revealing: signal 0 is sent for weak students (s=0) and signal 1 is sent for excellent students (s=1). Given this, the receiver can perfectly infer the student's quality from the signal. Since the receiver prefers to hire excellent students (reward +1) and penalizes hiring weak students (-1), the best response is to never hire on signal 0 (weak student) and always hire on signal 1 (excellent student). This strategy maximizes the receiver's expected payoff and brings no loss to the sender since only excellent students are hired.",
