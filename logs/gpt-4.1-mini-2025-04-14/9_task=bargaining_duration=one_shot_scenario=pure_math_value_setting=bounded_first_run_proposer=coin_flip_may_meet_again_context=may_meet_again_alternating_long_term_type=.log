At x=0.5, responder payoff is zero, so they are indifferent but will accept to maximize their utility in a rational setting. Thus, choosing x=0.5 maximizes my payoff to (1+2*0.5)/3 = (1+1)/3 = 2/3.

The responder will accept the offer only if their payoff from acceptance, (1 - 2*x)/3, is at least as high as the payoff from rejection, which is 0. This means (1 - 2*x)/3 >= 0, or 1 - 2*x >= 0, so x <= 0.5. Since x must be between 0 and 0.5, the responder will accept any x in this range. To maximize my payoff, I should choose x = 0.5 to keep the maximum amount for myself. At x=0.5, my payoff is (1 + 2*0.5)/3 = (1 + 1)/3 = 2/3 ≈ 0.6667, and the responder's payoff is (1 - 2*0.5)/3 = (1 - 1)/3 = 0, which is the lowest the responder will accept. The responder is rational and self-interested, so they will accept since 0 is not worse than rejection payoff (which is 0). Therefore, x=0.5 maximizes my payoff and will be accepted.",

This means if I accept, my payoff is 0, and if I reject, my payoff is also 0. Since accepting does not improve my payoff compared to rejecting, I am indifferent but rationality suggests accepting or rejecting? Since accepting results in no loss but no gain, indifference; but no incentive to accept, rejecting yields 0, so acceptance or rejection yield the same payoff of 0. To be strictly self-interested and rational, accepting is fine as it does not produce a worse outcome, but rejection is also fine. Both choices are payoff equivalent. However, to prevent the proposer from exploiting me completely in future rounds, I might reject to signal unwillingness. But since this is a one-time game, and no outside effects given, my best payoff is 0 either way. I will accept (y=1) as it avoids unnecessary conflict and is payoff equivalent.",

The responder will only accept if their payoff (1-2*x)/3 is at least 0, otherwise they reject and both get 0. So the responder will accept only if (1-2*x)/3 >= 0, which implies 1-2*x >= 0, or x <= 0.5. Since the maximum x I can choose is 0.5, the responder will accept any x in [0, 0.5]. Rationally, the responder will accept any offer because their payoff is non-negative. So to maximize my payoff, I choose x = 0.5, which gives me (1+2*0.5)/3 = (1+1)/3 = 2/3, the maximum possible payoff. The responder gets (1-2*0.5)/3 = (1 -1)/3 = 0, no gain but not negative, so they accept. Thus, the best strategy is x = 0.5.",
