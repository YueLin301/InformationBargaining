    "Analysis": "As the proposer, I want to maximize my payoff x, but the responder must accept the offer for me to get any payoff. The responder receives (1 - x) if they accept and 0 if they reject. Since the responder is rational and self-interested, they will accept only if (1 - x) >= 0, which means x <= 1. To maximize my payoff while ensuring acceptance, I should set x as high as possible while still giving the responder an incentive to accept. Setting x = 1 leaves the responder with zero payoff, which is equal to rejecting, so the responder is indifferent and might reject. To ensure acceptance, I can offer x just slightly less than 1, say x = 1 - ε with an infinitesimally small ε > 0. Since ε cannot be zero, in practice I choose the price very close to 1, ensuring the responder gets a very small positive payoff (1 - x > 0) and will accept. Thus, I will choose x = 1 to maximize my payoff, anticipating the responder will accept given payoff is at least zero.",

The responder will accept if their payoff (1 - x) is at least as high as their payoff from rejecting (0). Since the responder is rational and self-interested, they will accept any offer where (1 - x) >= 0, i.e., x <= 1. To maximize my payoff x, I can propose the highest x that the responder will accept, which is x = 1. However, if I propose x = 1, the responder gets 0 and will be indifferent between accepting and rejecting; in such tie cases responders typically reject offers that give them zero payoff because accepting or rejecting yields the same payoff and rejection might be chosen. To ensure acceptance, I must propose x < 1, say x = 0.999..., so the responder gets slightly more than zero and will accept.

The responder, being rational and self-interested, will accept the offer only if their payoff (1 - x) is at least as good as rejecting (which is 0). Therefore, the responder will accept if 1 - x >= 0, i.e., x <= 1. Since the responder will accept any x <= 1, I want to maximize x but not exceed 1. Any x greater than 1 would not be accepted, but since the price must be between 0 and 1, the maximum x I can propose is 1. The responder will accept, as their payoff is 0, which is equal to rejecting. Being rational, indifferent responders usually accept. Hence, my optimal decision is to propose x = 1.",

To maximize my payoff, I should set x as high as possible while still ensuring acceptance, i.e., x = 1. However, the responder will only accept if their payoff is non-negative, so at x=1, their payoff is 0, which they are indifferent to accepting or rejecting. Since the responder is rational, they would accept any non-negative payoff (including zero) if it yields them as much or more than rejecting, which gives zero.

The responder will accept if their payoff (1 - x) is at least as good as rejecting, which gives them 0. Therefore, (1 - x) >= 0, meaning x <= 1. To maximize my payoff, I should select the highest x such that the responder is still willing to accept. Setting x just less than or equal to 1 is acceptable, but if x = 1, responder payoff is 0, so they are indifferent and may accept or reject. To guarantee acceptance, offer x slightly less than 1, for example x = 1, is optimal from my perspective considering rational acceptance at zero payoff is acceptable. However, the problem doesn't specify tie-breaking, but since responder is rational and indifferent, accepting gives 0 payoff which is no worse than rejecting. So the maximum x I can ask for is 1.",

Since the responder is indifferent between accepting and rejecting when the payoff is zero, they will accept if their payoff is equal or greater than 0, so x <= 1 is acceptable.
