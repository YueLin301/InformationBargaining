  "Analysis": "As the proposer, I want to maximize my own payoff x. The responder will accept the offer only if their payoff (1-x) is at least as good as rejecting (which yields 0). Since the responder is rational and self-interested, they will accept any offer where (1-x) > 0. So, the smallest positive offer I can make to the responder is any value slightly greater than 0. To maximize my share, I should offer the responder the smallest amount that makes them accept, say an infinitesimally small positive amount epsilon, and keep approximately 1 for myself. However, since epsilon must be a real number between 0 and 1, I will choose x close to 1, but less than 1 (e.g., 0.9999). This ensures the responder prefers accepting the offer (getting a small positive payoff) over rejecting (which gives zero).",

Since the responder is rational and self-interested, they will accept the offer if they get a payoff greater than 0 by accepting, i.e., (1 - x) > 0.

  "Analysis": "As the proposer, my goal is to maximize my own payoff, which is x. The responder will accept the offer only if their payoff (1-x) is at least as good as rejecting (0). Since the responder is self-interested and rational, they will accept any offer where (1-x) > 0, meaning any x < 1. To maximize my payoff, I want to offer the smallest possible share to the responder that they will still accept. Offering x = 1 means the responder gets 0 and will reject, resulting in 0 payoff for me. Offering any x just less than 1 will be accepted. Therefore, the best is to propose x = 1, which would be rejected and payoff 0, or slightly less than 1 (like 0.999999), where the responder will accept and I get nearly 1. It is logical and consistent to propose x = 1 - epsilon (epsilon arbitrarily small).

{
    "Analysis": "As the proposer, I want to maximize my own payoff x. The responder will accept any offer where their payoff (1-x) is at least 0, meaning any offer with x <= 1 will be accepted, since getting something is better than getting nothing. To maximize my payoff while ensuring acceptance, I should offer the smallest positive amount possible to the responder (essentially 0 or close to 0). This way, I keep nearly all the money and the responder prefers accepting this offer over rejecting and getting 0. Given the rationality of both players, the responder will accept any accepted share greater than 0. Therefore, my best decision is to propose x = 1, meaning I keep the entire amount and offer zero to the responder, but since the responder will reject zero, I will slightly reduce my share to just less than 1 (for example, 0.999...); however, since the responder can only accept or reject, and I cannot offer a strictly less than 1 with infinite precision here, I'll choose x=1 but knowing responder will reject; thus, I must pick x = 1 - ε, where ε is infinitesimally small, practically 0. To ensure acceptance, I choose x=0.999999. This maximizes my payoff while ensuring acceptance.",

  "Analysis": "As the proposer, I want to maximize my payoff x, but the responder will only accept if (1 - x) >= 0, meaning the responder must get a non-negative payoff. Since the responder is rational and self-interested, they will reject any offer that gives them less than zero payoff, and will accept any offer where their payoff is positive. Offering (1 - x) = 0 is equivalent to offering the responder nothing, which will be rejected. Therefore, the minimal positive amount I must offer to get acceptance is very close to 0, say epsilon > 0, so that the responder prefers accepting with a payoff close to 0 rather than rejecting and receiving 0. To maximize my payoff, I propose to keep almost the entire amount, close to 1, leaving the smallest positive fraction to the responder. As 0 is the lowest amount the responder can get while still accepting, I propose x = 1 - epsilon, practically 1, for some tiny positive epsilon. For this task, I'll choose x = 0.999999 to represent this idea.",
