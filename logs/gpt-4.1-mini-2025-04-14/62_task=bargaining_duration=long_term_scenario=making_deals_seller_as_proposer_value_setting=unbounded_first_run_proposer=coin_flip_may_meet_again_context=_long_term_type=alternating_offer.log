  "Analysis": "As the proposer, I want to maximize my payoff x. The responder will accept only if their payoff (1 - x) is at least as good as their expected payoff from rejecting and becoming the proposer in the next round. Since there's a 10% chance of timeout each round and the maximum number of steps is 10, the expected continuation value for the responder is relatively low. The responder is also self-interested and rational, so they will only accept offers where (1 - x) is greater or equal to what they can expect by rejecting. Given the risk of timeout (which yields zero payoff), the responder will accept any offer giving them a positive payoff. So I can offer x close to 1, but to ensure acceptance, I should offer a very small positive share to the responder so that they prefer acceptance to rejecting with some risk of getting zero in later rounds. Therefore, I choose x = 0.95, giving the responder 0.05, which they are likely to accept.",

 Now the proposer decides that x=0.95.

Given that the game can continue with role switching and has a timeout, I need to decide if accepting 0.05 now is better than rejecting and then becoming the proposer. As the proposer, I can choose x to maximize my payoff. In my turn as proposer, I would set x close to 1 to maximize my payoff, but the responder might reject if (1-x) is too low. However, due to the possibility of rejection and role switching, I can anticipate that the other player will reject too-high x, so the equilibrium price is around 0.5. Thus, rejecting now and becoming proposer next turn gives a chance for better payoff. Also, given the high x now (0.95), the payoff for me is very low (0.05). Hence, rejecting is rational.",

    "Analysis": "At timestep 0, the opponent proposed x=0.95, leaving me (the responder) only 0.05, which I rationally rejected because accepting such a low payoff is not beneficial. Now, at timestep 1, I am the proposer and want to offer a price x that maximizes my payoff while ensuring the responder (the opponent) accepts it. The opponent will accept the offer if their payoff (1 - x) is at least as good as the expected payoff they could get by rejecting and proposing at the next timestep. Given rationality and self-interest, the opponent expects a similar bargaining scenario at the next step, but with roles reversed and possibly one less timestep. Given the limited number of timesteps and 0.1 chance of stopping each round, the opponent will likely accept any offer where their payoff is not less than zero and better than what they expect from continuing. Offering an extremely high x like 0.95 previously was rejected, so I should offer a lower x to increase the chance of acceptance, but I want to maximize my payoff. Offering x=0.9 gives the opponent 0.1, which is better, but may still be rejected. To assure acceptance, I should consider offering about x=0.8, giving the opponent 0.2. This gives the opponent a more reasonable payoff and increases likelihood of acceptance, while retaining a substantial payoff for me. Given the discounted chance of continuation and role switching, the opponent would not reject an offer giving at least 0.2 payoff. Therefore, I choose x=0.8.",

 Now the proposer decides that x=0.8.

  "Analysis": "As the proposer at timestep 0, my goal is to maximize my payoff x. The responder will accept the offer only if their payoff (1 - x) is at least as much as they expect to get if they reject and roles switch. Since the game has a 10% chance of ending each round and a hard stop at timestep 10, the expected future payoff for the responder decreases over time. At the initial timestep, given rationality and self-interest on both sides, the responder won't accept an offer where their payoff is less than or equal to their expected payoff in the next round. The responder's expected payoff in the next round is approximately equal to the equilibrium payoff in the alternating-offer bargaining with discount factor 0.9 per round (since 0.1 chance of stopping means discount factor roughly 0.9). Given this, the equilibrium offer x is roughly 0.55 - 0.6, meaning I can keep about 55-60% of the price. To maximize my payoff, I offer x=0.6, leaving 0.4 for the responder, which should be acceptable given the discounting and role switching.",

{
  "Analysis": "As the proposer at timestep 0, I want to maximize my payoff x, but the responder will accept only if their payoff (1-x) is at least as much as they expect to get if they reject now and become proposer in the next round. Both players are rational and self-interested, and there's a 10% chance that the game ends after each round, and a hard limit at timestep 10. The responder will expect a similar bargaining situation when they become proposer. Because of the risk of timeout, the responder's expected value when rejecting decreases with time, making them more likely to accept offers that leave them marginally positive. At the first round, the responder expects that as proposer they can propose a high x, but they risk timeouts. The classic subgame perfect equilibrium of alternating offers with discounting leads to an equilibrium split of payoffs; the proposer can offer the responder just enough to accept. Since the timeout probability per round is 0.1, the responder's expected continuation value is approximately the equilibrium payoffs discounted by this risk. Simplifying, offering the responder around 0.5 or slightly less might be rejected, but offering them around 0.5 or more will be accepted. To maximize my payoff, I will offer the minimum that the responder would accept—i.e., leave them their expected continuation value. We estimate this to be roughly around 0.45 to 0.5. Therefore, I propose x = 0.55, keeping 55% and leaving 45% to the responder. This is likely to be accepted by a rational responder valuing their expected payoff and the risk of timeout.",

    "Analysis": "I am the proposer at timestep 0, seeking to maximize my payoff x. The responder will accept only if their payoff (1 - x) is at least as good as their expected payoff from rejecting and becoming proposer next turn. Because each round has a 0.1 chance of terminating without agreement, the expected continuation payoff if rejected is smaller but positive. The optimal strategy is to offer the responder their minimum acceptable payoff, which in equilibrium is 0.5, since both are symmetric self-interested rational players. Offering x = 0.5 means I keep half the price, and the responder gets half, which they will accept rather than risk zero payoffs. Offering more to myself risks rejection and role switching with some timeout risk. So I propose x = 0.5.",

The responder will accept if their payoff (1 - x) is at least as good as their expected payoff from rejecting and later proposing. Since the game has at most 10 timesteps and a 0.1 probability of ending each round, the responder anticipates they will get 0 if they reject now and risk the game ending or having to settle for less. The responder is rational and self-interested, so they will accept any offer that gives them at least the expected value of future offers. The minimal acceptable offer to the responder would be close to zero but more than zero to motivate acceptance. To maximize my payoff, I can offer the smallest positive amount to the responder, i.e., x close to 1. Given the risk of timeout and role-switching, responder will accept offers with (1-x) down to about zero. Therefore, I choose x=0.9 to balance getting a high payoff and ensuring the offer is accepted.",

  "Analysis": "As the proposer at timestep 0, I want to maximize my payoff by choosing the highest price x that the responder is still willing to accept. The responder will accept if their payoff (1 - x) is at least as good as the expected payoff from rejecting and switching roles, considering the 0.1 probability the game ends each round and the maximum 10 rounds. Since both players are rational and self-interested, the responder will accept offers where (1 - x) is greater or equal to the expected payoff they can get as a proposer in the next round. Because the discount on delay (due to probabilistic ending) is small, I can propose a price that leaves the responder just enough incentive to accept, which is slightly less than or equal to 0.5. Proposing x = 0.5 splits the payoff equally, responder gets 0.5. To maximize my payoff, I propose x slightly above 0.5, but if it's too high, responder will reject. The rational responder will accept only if their payoff is better than expected future offers, but given the discount, they will accept a bit less than 0.5. Therefore, I propose x = 0.55, expecting the responder to accept since 0.45 payoff is slightly less but still potentially better because the game may end if they reject and roles switch. This balances maximizing my payoff and assuring acceptance.",

{
  "Analysis": "As the proposer and a self-interested rational buyer, I want to maximize my payoff, which is the price x I propose. The responder wants to maximize their payoff, which is 1 - x if they accept. The responder will accept if the expected payoff from accepting is better than the expected payoff from rejecting. Given the symmetrical nature of the game and role switching after rejection, the responder knows that if they reject, roles switch and the opponent becomes the proposer at timestep 1. Since there is also a 10% chance the game might end each round and a maximum of 10 rounds, both sides prefer to reach an agreement early. The standard subgame perfect equilibrium in alternating offers bargaining with discounting or probability of termination implies that the proposer should propose the minimal amount acceptable to the responder to ensure acceptance, while maximizing their own payoff. Since there is a 10% chance of game ending each round, the responder discounts future payoffs. This discount factor d is 0.9 (continuation probability). The proposer's offer x should satisfy that the responder prefers accepting now (payoff 1 - x) over rejecting and getting an expected value of d times what they expect in the next round as proposer. By symmetry, expected payoff for the responder as proposer at timestep 1 is the same as my payoff at timestep 0, because roles switch and time advances by 1 with a discount. We can solve for x accordingly: Let V be the expected payoff for the proposer at timestep 0, then the responder as proposer at timestep 1 has expected payoff V. The responder will accept offer x if 1 - x >= d * V. The proposer wants to maximize x subject to this. At equilibrium, 1 - x = d * V, and V = x (proposer's expected payoff). From these two equations, V = x and 1 - x = d * V = d * x, so 1 - x = d * x => 1 = x(d + 1) => x = 1/(1 + d) = 1/(1 + 0.9) = 1/1.9 ≈ 0.5263. Thus, the optimal price x to propose is approximately 0.5263, which gives the responder payoff 1 - 0.5263 = 0.4737, which is exactly equal to the discounted expected value of rejecting. This offer will be accepted by the responder, maximizing my expected payoff under rationality and self-interest given the discounting. Therefore, I will propose x = 0.5263.",

 Now the proposer decides that x=0.5263.

The responder will accept only if their payoff (1 - x) is at least as high as the expected payoff if the offer is rejected. If the offer is rejected, roles switch and the responder becomes the proposer at timestep 1. Since the game can end randomly with 0.1 probability at each step or definitely at timestep 10, the responder's expected payoff from rejecting now is less than 1, but increases with waiting for a better offer in future rounds. Therefore, to induce acceptance now, I must offer at least the responder's expected future payoff from rejecting now. Given the discount due to random timeout (0.1 chance of stopping each step), the expected responder payoff from waiting is less than 1 but close to it. So I should offer x close to 0, leaving almost all to the responder, to secure acceptance now and avoid the risk of zero payoff if game times out.

{
  "Analysis": "As the proposer at timestep 0, I want to maximize my payoff x. The responder, being rational and self-interested, will accept if their payoff (1 - x) is at least as good as the expected payoff from rejecting and switching roles. When the responder rejects, they become the proposer and get to propose a price themselves, with the probability that the game ends after each round being 0.1. Considering the discount from timeout risk, the most rational responder's acceptance threshold is that (1 - x) should be no less than their expected payoff from becoming proposer at the next timestep. Given symmetry and discount, a fair split is likely the subgame perfect equilibrium. To ensure acceptance, I can offer a small surplus to the responder, just above what they'd expect if rejecting. Offering x = 0.9 keeps me with 0.9 and the responder with 0.1. If the responder rejects, they risk zero if the game ends quickly and the possibility to get higher payoff later, but with the timeout risk, their expected payoff is about 0.5. Therefore, I should offer a price x close to 0.5 to ensure acceptance. Offering x = 0.5 maximizes my expected payoff while ensuring acceptance by responder. If I offer more than 0.5, risk rejection; if less, lose payoff unnecessarily.",

    "Analysis": "As the proposer at the initial timestep (0), I want to maximize my expected payoff while ensuring the responder, who is also rational and self-interested, accepts the offer. The responder will accept any offer where their payoff (1 - x) is at least as good as what they expect from rejecting and switching roles, taking into account the timeout probability and discounting the value of future offers. Given the 0.1 probability of stopping each round and the maximum 10 timesteps, the responder can expect to propose at timestep 1 if they reject now, aiming for a similar or better outcome. To make the responder accept, I should offer a slightly better expected value than what they can get by rejecting and switching roles. Offering around x = 0.9 means I keep 0.9, leaving 0.1 for the responder, which is low but may be acceptable given the risk of timeout and game ending with no reward. Minimizing the amount given to the responder while ensuring acceptance is optimal for me. Therefore, I decide to propose x = 0.9.",

Knowing that agent 0 rejected 0.1 previously, they likely expect a better share, at least close to or above 0.1. Due to the possibility of role switching and timeout, I want to offer just enough to make the offer acceptable but still maximize my payoff. Offering 0.9 for myself again risks rejection, so I should offer a price keeping x at 0.6 or slightly higher, giving agent 0 (responder) at least 0.4 (1-x). 0.4 is a significant increase from 0.1 and would give a higher expected payoff than rejection with timeout probability. Given rationality and the chance of eventual timeout, the responder has an incentive to accept an offer better than previous low offers. Thus, I decide on x = 0.6, keeping 0.6 for myself and giving 0.4 to agent 0, expecting acceptance.",

Then, when it was their turn to propose, they offered 0.6 for themselves and kept 0.4 for me, which I rejected as it gives me only 0.4. Given that at each round there is a 10% chance the game ends, and at timestep 2 we are still early in the game, the opponent is rational and self-interested and will only accept an offer that gives them at least as much utility as rejecting and making the next offer. To get the opponent to accept, I must offer them at least 0.5, since if they reject, they risk the game ending with zero payoff but also have a chance to propose their own price and get at least 0.6 as they previously proposed. However, since the roles alternate, I should propose a price x such that I keep slightly more than 0.5 for myself, but they get at least 0.5. The fair split is x=0.5, but since I am self-interested and rational, I can offer marginally less, say x=0.51, meaning the opponent gets 0.49. This makes the expected payoff for the opponent from accepting better or comparable than rejecting and trying to get 0.6 in the next round, considering the 10% timeout risk. Therefore, I propose x=0.51 to increase chances of acceptance and my payoff.",

If I reject, the game continues with me as the proposer at the next timestep (3), but there's a 0.1 chance the game ends. Given the decreasing offers, accepting 0.49 is better than risking a lower offer or game ending with 0 payoff. Therefore, accepting yields a higher expected payoff.",

{
  "Analysis": "As the proposer at timestep 0, I want to maximize my payoff x, but the responder will only accept if their payoff (1-x) is at least as large as what they expect to get if they reject and become proposer at the next timestep. Since the game can end at any timestep with 0.1 probability, and the maximum number of steps is 10, the expected payoffs from future offers are discounted. Because both players are rational and self-interested, the responder will accept any offer where (1-x) is at least equal to what they expect to gain by rejecting now and proposing later. The optimal equilibrium offer in such alternating offers with discounting is to offer the responder a small positive payoff that equals their discounted expected payoff from rejecting now. At timestep 0, to encourage acceptance and avoid continuation risk, offering roughly around 0.5 as a split is a safe option. Given the discount factor from 0.1 probability of ending each round, the responder’s expected payoff from rejecting is less than 0.5, so I can offer slightly less than 0.5 to maximize my payoff while still ensuring acceptance.",

  "Analysis": "As the proposer at timestep 0, I want to maximize my expected payoff. The responder will accept an offer x only if their payoff (1 - x) is at least as good as what they expect to get by rejecting and becoming the proposer in the next round. Since the game can continue with a 0.9 probability and the roles will be reversed, the responder, as the next proposer, can offer me a price that maximizes their payoff, which will be 1 for them if the responder wants to maximize their gain. Since both are rational and self-interested, to have the responder accept, I must offer them at least as much as they expect to gain by rejecting (which is better than 0). To keep the responder indifferent, I can offer an amount (1 - x) equal to the expected value of being the proposer next round, discounted by the probability the game continues. Because the game has a 0.1 chance of stopping each round, the expected value for the responder as proposer next round is approximately 1 (since they will choose x=1 for themselves, giving me zero). Therefore, the immediate acceptance is unlikely unless I offer a high payoff to the responder. Since this is the first move, I will offer a slightly better than zero payoff to the responder to make acceptance more likely. Hence, I offer x=0.9, giving the responder 0.1, balancing a small payoff to them while maximizing my own at this early round.",

The responder is rational and self-interested, so they will accept any offer that gives them at least what they expect to get if they reject and become proposer. In the previous round, they proposed 0.9 for themselves, so their expected payoff as proposer is close to 0.9. Considering the risk that the game could end soon with no payoff, the responder may accept a price that gives them a payoff close to but less than 0.9. To ensure acceptance, I should offer the responder just enough to make acceptance rational, ideally leaving myself with about 0.1 to 0.2 to get a better payoff than zero. Offering x = 0.2 means I keep 0.2 and the responder gets 0.8, which is slightly worse than 0.9 but the responder may accept due to the risk of losing everything with timeout.
