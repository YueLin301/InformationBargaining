  "Analysis": "As the proposer (seller), I want to maximize my payoff x while ensuring the responder (buyer) accepts the offer. The responder receives (1 - x) if they accept, and 0 if they reject. Being rational and self-interested, the responder will accept any offer where (1 - x) >= 0, i.e., any x <= 1. However, to ensure acceptance and maximize my payoff, I will offer the smallest positive amount to the responder so they prefer accepting over rejecting. Since rejecting yields 0 for the responder and accepting any amount greater than 0 yields positive utility, I can set x just below 1. To avoid edge cases, I offer x = 1, meaning the responder gets 0. They will be indifferent between accepting (0) and rejecting (0) but as a rational agent, the responder may accept. However, to ensure strict acceptance, I will set x = 1 - ε, where ε is a very small positive number, so the responder strictly prefers accepting over rejecting. For the sake of a single numeric output in [0,1], I choose x = 0.999 as an approximation to maximize my payoff while securing acceptance.",

The responder is rational and self-interested, so they will accept only if their payoff (1-x) is at least as good as rejecting (0). Thus, the responder accepts if (1-x) >= 0, which means x <= 1. This is always true for x in [0,1]. Since the responder has no incentive to reject offers giving them a positive payoff, they will accept any x less than or equal to 1. To maximize my payoff, I should set x as high as possible up to 1. However, if x = 1, then the responder's payoff is 0, which is indifferent to rejection. Given rationality and indifference, the responder might accept. Therefore, offering x=1 might yield acceptance, but if the responder rejects at zero payoff, I get 0. Because responders are rational, I expect acceptance at x=1. Hence, I will offer x=1 to maximize my payoff.",

To maximize my payoff, I should offer the smallest amount that ensures acceptance, so I choose x = 1, but that gives the responder 0, which is no better than rejecting. The responder would reject at x = 1, so I must offer slightly less than 1, say x = 1 - ε, with ε > 0 very small, ensuring responder's payoff is positive and they accept.

    "Analysis": "As the proposer, I want to maximize my payoff x while ensuring the responder (buyer) accepts the offer. The responder's payoff if they accept is (1 - x). Since the responder is rational and self-interested, they will accept only if their payoff is at least as good as rejecting (which yields 0). Thus, the responder will accept any offer where (1 - x) >= 0, meaning x <= 1. To maximize my payoff while ensuring acceptance, I should set x as high as possible but still not exceed 1, which means x = 1. However, if x = 1, the responder's payoff is 0, which is exactly equal to their rejection payoff, so they are indifferent and might reject. Since the responder is rational and may be indifferent, they may reject if indifferent because no strict advantage is gained. To guarantee acceptance, I should offer slightly less than 1, say x = 0.9999, ensuring the responder strictly benefits by accepting (positive payoff). Thus, I will choose x = 0.9999 to maximize my payoff ensuring acceptance.",

  "Analysis": "As the proposer (seller), I choose the price x to maximize my payoff given that the responder (buyer) will accept only if their payoff (1 - x) is non-negative and better than rejecting (which yields zero). Since the responder is rational and self-interested, they will accept if 1 - x >= 0, meaning x <= 1. The responder is indifferent at x = 1, but rejecting yields 0, so for any x < 1, the responder strictly prefers to accept. To maximize my payoff, I should set x as close to 1 as possible without making the responder reject. Since the responder will accept any x < 1, I will choose x = 1, because at x = 1, the responder payoff is zero and might accept; however, to ensure acceptance, I choose slightly less, e.g., x = 0.9999. This yields almost 1 payoff for me and the responder a very small positive payoff. Therefore, the best rational strategy is to choose x very close to 1 but less than 1.",

  "Analysis": "As the proposer (seller), I want to maximize my payoff, which is x. The responder will accept the offer only if their payoff, 1 - x, is at least as good as rejecting (which gives them 0). Therefore, the responder accepts if 1 - x >= 0, or x <= 1. Since x must be between 0 and 1, the responder will accept any price x ≤ 1. However, to ensure acceptance, I should not propose x = 1 because that leaves the responder with zero payoff, and given rationality and the possibility of future games, the responder might reject a zero or disadvantageous offer. To guarantee acceptance, I should offer the minimal amount just above zero to the responder, i.e., leave them with a payoff just greater than 0, such as x = 1 - ε, where ε is very small. Since we are dealing with real numbers, I can set x = 1. However, if the responder is strictly rational and indifferent to zero payoff at rejecting or accepting, the responder might accept at zero payoff. So, proposing x = 1 is optimal for me if the responder accepts indifferent offers. Otherwise, to be safe, choose x slightly less than 1 to ensure acceptance. Given these considerations, I will propose x = 1 to maximize my payoff with rational responder behavior.",

The responder will accept the offer only if their payoff (1 - x) is at least as good as rejecting, which yields 0. Therefore, the responder will accept if 1 - x >= 0, i.e., x <= 1. Since I can set x anywhere between 0 and 1, the highest price I can set such that the responder still accepts is x = 1. However, if I set x = 1, the responder gets 0 and may be indifferent, but since they are rational and selfish, they might accept if indifferent. But for safety, I consider the responder will accept when they get a strictly positive payoff, so x must be less than 1. Hence, I will set x as close as possible to 1 to maximize my payoff. I choose x = 1 as the optimal offer, expecting the responder to accept because their gain is 0, matching their outside option.",

  "Analysis": "As the proposer, I want to maximize my payoff x, but the responder (buyer) will only accept if they get a non-negative payoff, i.e., 1 - x >= 0. Since the buyer is rational and self-interested, they will accept any offer that gives them a positive payoff, even if it's very small. Therefore, the optimal strategy is to propose the highest x close to 1, while leaving the responder with the smallest positive payoff approaching zero. This means I will set x just slightly less than 1, ensuring acceptance and maximizing my payoff.",
