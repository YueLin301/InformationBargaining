Since the responder is rational and self-interested, they will accept any offer where 1 - x > 0, or x < 1. Therefore, to maximize my payoff while still having the responder accept, I should set x as close to 1 as possible but less than 1. For example, x = 0.9999 provides almost the entire unit payoff to me, inducing the responder to accept for a payoff slightly above 0.

Since x must be between 0 and 1, the responder will accept any offer where x is at most 1. However, the responder is self-interested and rational, so they will reject any offer where their payoff is less than or equal to zero. To ensure acceptance, I should set x as high as possible but not so high that the responder prefers to reject. If I set x = 1, the responder’s payoff is 1 - 1 = 0, which might be accepted or not.

  "Analysis": "As the proposer and self-interested rational player, I want to maximize my payoff by choosing the highest possible price x such that the responder will still accept the offer. The responder gets 1 - x if they accept. Since the responder is also rational and self-interested, they will accept the offer only if their payoff is at least zero or better than rejecting (which yields zero). Therefore, the minimum acceptable payoff for the responder is 0. Hence, the responder will accept any offer where 1 - x >= 0, meaning x <= 1. To maximize my payoff, I should set x as high as possible within the allowed range, which is 1. However, if I set x = 1, the responder gets 0, and since they are indifferent between accepting and rejecting, they might reject. But since we both expect rationality and they are indifferent, the responder could accept. To ensure acceptance firmly and avoid rejection due to indifference, it is better to set slightly less than 1, e.g., x = 0.9999, so that the responder gets positive payoff and will accept for sure. This maximizes my payoff. Therefore, I choose x close to 1 but slightly less to guarantee acceptance.",

  "Analysis": "As the proposer (seller), I want to maximize my payoff x. The responder (buyer) will accept the offer if and only if their payoff (1 - x) is at least 0, meaning any x in [0,1] is acceptable if it brings them non-negative payoff. Since the responder is rational and self-interested, they will accept any offer with x <= 1. To maximize my own payoff, I want to set x as close to 1 as possible while ensuring acceptance. The responder will accept any offer where (1 - x) >= 0, so I can set x = 1 and expect the responder to accept to get 0 payoff rather than reject and get nothing. However, if I set x = 1, the responder gets 0 and might be indifferent between accepting or rejecting. Assuming the responder is rational and will accept indifferent offers (as they do not lose anything), it's optimal to set x = 1. Hence, I propose x = 1 to maximize my payoff.",

  "Analysis": "As the proposer, I want to maximize my payoff x, but I must ensure that the responder (the buyer) accepts the offer. The responder only accepts if their payoff (1 - x) is at least as high as rejecting, which yields 0. Hence, the responder accepts if 1 - x >= 0, or x <= 1. Since the responder is rational and self-interested, they accept any offer where their payoff is strictly positive, or at least zero. To maximize my payoff while ensuring acceptance, I can set x to 1. However, if x = 1, the responder's payoff is 0, so the responder is indifferent between accepting and rejecting. Assuming the responder will accept an offer that does not make them worse off, they will accept x = 1. Therefore, my best choice is to choose x = 1 and get the maximum payoff possible.",
