Proposer: Agent 1:

{
  "Analysis": "As the proposer at timestep 0, I want to maximize my own payoff. However, the responder is rational and self-interested, so they will only accept offers where their expected payoff is at least as good as what they could get by rejecting and becoming the proposer at the next step. If they reject, roles switch and it moves to timestep 1 with 0.1 probability of the game ending prematurely. Since the game can stop randomly at each step and there is a cap at timestep 10, the responder's discounted expected payoff decreases over time. Thus, I can propose a high share for myself while offering a small enough amount to make the responder indifferent or slightly prefer to accept now rather than wait for the roles to reverse. The minimum acceptable offer to the responder is therefore their expected payoff as proposer in the next step, discounted by the probability of continuation. Given this, I will offer myself 0.9 and leave 0.1 for the responder. This gives me the maximum payoff while giving the responder a non-zero but low payoff that should be accepted to avoid the risk of the game ending with zero payoff.",

 Now the proposer decides that x=0.9.

  "Analysis": "At timestep 0, my opponent (agent 1) proposed to keep 0.9 for themselves and leave 0.1 for me. I rejected because accepting 0.1 is suboptimal compared to the potential of getting a better offer or rejecting to switch roles. Now at timestep 1, I am the proposer. I want to maximize my own payoff x, but if I propose too high a value, my opponent will reject and we will switch roles again, decreasing my expected payoff. Since there is a 10% chance the game ends each round and a maximum of 10 timesteps, delay is costly. I expect my opponent to act rationally to maximize their own payoff, so I should offer them just enough to accept, i.e., something equal or better than what they can get by rejecting and switching roles back to me. Because the opponent rejected 0.1 last round, they will want at least 0.1 this time; thus, I can propose to keep 0.9 for myself and offer 0.1 to them, expecting acceptance. If I try to increase my share further (above 0.9), the opponent will reject, resetting to me as the responder, potentially starting a costly cycle. Hence, I choose x=0.9 to maximize my payoff while ensuring acceptance.",

  "Analysis": "As the proposer at timestep 0, I want to maximize my payoff while ensuring the responder accepts the offer. The responder will accept if their payoff (1 - x) is at least as good as the expected payoff from rejecting and making a counteroffer. If the responder rejects, roles swap, and I will be the responder faced with a new offer. Given the 0.1 probability of game ending each round, and the maximum 10 timesteps, the responder's expected payoff from rejecting is less than 1 and decreases with the probability of timeout and role switch. Therefore, I can propose an offer that gives the responder enough to accept, but close to minimal. The minimal offer that will be accepted is just slightly more than 0 because rejecting risks getting 0 later. Thus, proposing to keep about 0.9 for myself (i.e., offering the responder 0.1) should be accepted as it yields more than the expected value of rejection.",

  "Analysis": "The proposer is offering 0.1 to me and keeping 0.9 for themselves. If I accept, I get 0.1 payoff immediately. If I reject, the roles will switch and I become the proposer with the opportunity to propose a better split, but there's a 10% chance the game ends at each step with zero payoff for both. Given that rejecting risks the game ending with no payoff and accepting guarantees 0.1 payoff, this is better than risking zero payoff. However, since I am rational and self-interested, I should consider whether I can secure a better expected payoff by rejecting. As the next proposer, I can propose x=1 for myself, leaving 0 for the other, but then the other (current proposer) would certainly reject as it's zero for them, prolonging the game further with risk of timeout. Given the risk of zero payoff on rejection, accepting 0.1 payoff now is rational.",

  "Analysis": "As the proposer at timestep 0, I want to maximize my own payoff x, while ensuring the responder accepts the offer. The responder will accept only if their payoff 1 - x is at least as large as their expected payoff from continuing the game when roles switch. The game has a 0.1 stopping probability each round and a max of 10 timesteps. Given that the other player is rational and self-interested, they will reject low offers only if their expected future payoff is higher than current. Due to discounting from stopping probability and the risk of timeout with no payoff, the responder will likely accept offers close to even split or slightly less than even, since rejecting is risky and may yield zero. To maximize my payoff, I propose a split slightly favoring myself but still acceptable to the responder. Offering myself 0.6 means responder gets 0.4, which is better than zero and likely acceptable considering the risk. Lower offers to myself (i.e., higher to responder) mean less payoff for me. Higher offers to myself risk rejection and role switch, so 0.6 is a logical equilibrium offer.",

Since the timer is at 0 with a low chance (0.1) of early stop each round and max 10 steps, the risk is moderate. The proposer is taking a relatively generous share, leaving 0.4 for me. Rejecting might lead the other player to propose a lower share for themselves (higher for me) but is uncertain. Given rationality and self-interest, accepting 0.4 ensures a positive payoff now, whereas future payoff is uncertain and could be less if the other proposer also tries to maximize their own payoff.

  "Analysis": "At timestep 0, I am the proposer and want to maximize my payoff. Given the other player is self-interested and rational as well, they will only accept if their payoff (1 - x) is greater than or equal to what they expect by rejecting and becoming the proposer in the next step. Anticipating rational behavior and role switching with some probability of the game ending early, I should offer just enough for the responder to accept rather than risking rejection and a role switch. To maximize my payoff, I will offer the minimal share to the responder that ensures their acceptance. The equilibrium offer in such alternating proposer-responder games with possible early stopping is approximately the inverse of the time discounting. Since the timeout is at 10, the fair offer will be around 0.5 or slightly less to me. To increase my payoff, I will propose to keep 0.6 for myself, giving 0.4 to the responder, which should be acceptable for the responder considering their potential payoff by taking the proposer role after a rejection is uncertain and diluted by the 0.1 stopping probability each turn.",

As a rational agent, I anticipate that future offers will be similar or slightly more favorable to me if I reject now. However, rejecting risks getting nothing if the game times out.

If the responder rejects, roles swap and the game continues with some chance of timeout. If the offer is too low, the responder will reject, anticipating to propose a better split in the next step. Because the game has at most 10 steps, and a timeout chance of 0.1 each step, the responder will prefer accepting offers that are at least as good as the expected payoff from rejecting and switching roles, discounted by the chance that the game might end. The best strategy is to offer the responder the smallest amount that makes acceptance preferable to rejection. Hence, offering the responder a minimal positive amount near zero should suffice to induce acceptance as the responder values anything over zero more than the risk of getting nothing from timeout or role reversal. Therefore, I will propose to keep 0.99 for myself and leave 0.01 for the responder.",

  "Analysis": "At timestep 0, the opponent acted as proposer and offered to keep 0.99 for themselves, leaving only 0.01 for me as responder. I rejected since 0.01 is a very low payoff and I prefer to switch roles. Now at timestep 1, I am the proposer. Since the opponent is rational and self-interested, they will accept any offer providing them an expected payoff higher than zero since rejecting means continuing with risk of game ending with zero payoff. Given the risk of game ending increases with each timestep (with 10 timesteps max and 0.1 stopping probability each round), I should propose to keep as much for myself as possible while still offering the opponent a positive payoff that they will accept. Offering them an amount greater than 0 to ensure acceptance. Offering 0 means they get 0 if they accept and 0 if they reject, so rational responders may reject indifferent offers. Therefore, I choose to keep 0.9 and offer 0.1 to my opponent, which is significantly better than 0. This will likely be accepted immediately to avoid risk of game ending with zero payoff for both. This maximizes my expected payoff given the responder's rationality.",

When I become proposer, I can propose nearly all of the money to myself (like 0.99 previously). However, the other agent is rational and self-interested as well, and is likely to reject very low offers, risking zero payoffs if we keep rejecting till timeout. Given the small probability of timeout, but the limited rounds, accepting a low payoff now versus risking nothing later is a trade-off. Since 0.1 reward now is better than 0 reward if roles switch and game possibly continues with uncertain future payoff, I should accept this offer to maximize my expected payoff.",

{
  "Analysis": "As the proposer at timestep 0, I want to maximize my payoff. However, if I offer too much for myself (x close to 1), the responder may reject, hoping to become proposer next round and get a better deal. Since the game can end at any step with a 0.1 probability, and the max rounds is 10, the responder values immediate offers more. The responder will accept any offer that gives them a payoff at least as good as the expected payoff of rejecting. If I offer myself too much, the responder will reject. The game reasoning suggests offering the smallest amount that the responder will accept is best for me. Since the responder is rational and self-interested, the minimal accepted offer from the responder is any amount (1-x) greater or equal to their continuation expected value. The continuation expected value for the responder is roughly equal to the expected value when roles switch and discounted by the timeout probability. To avoid going into a detailed recurring equation, the equilibrium would likely be an offer splitting that slightly favors the proposer. Given the time limit and 0.1 stopping probability, offering around 0.9 (keeping 0.9) might be accepted since rejecting risks zero payoff. Therefore, I will propose to keep 0.9 for myself, leaving 0.1 for the responder, which is minimally acceptable due to timeout pressure.",

The responder (agent 1) rejected a 0.1 share previously, so I should propose slightly more than 0.1 to them, making the offer just appealing enough for agent 1 to accept.

Since the game may end with probability 0.1 each round and max at timestep 10, delaying to become the proposer and potentially getting a better offer is beneficial. However, there is a risk that the game ends before I get another chance to propose. The proposer at timestep 0 proposed 0.9 and was rejected, indicating they are willing to push for a high share. The proposer now has lowered the offer to 0.8, which still leaves me only 0.2. This is quite low and given the previous rejection, accepting 0.2 is not rational as I expect to do better by switching roles and proposing myself next timestep. Therefore, I reject this offer to switch roles and get a chance to propose an offer myself.",

Both of us are self-interested and rational, so we will only accept offers that give us a payoff greater than 0, and we expect the other to behave similarly. Since agent 0 rejected my 0.9 offer, they want more than 0.1 for themselves. Since I rejected the 0.8 offer, I want at least 0.2 for myself. The pattern suggests we need to reach an offer that benefits me more than 0.2 and agent 0 more than 0.1 to accept. To ensure acceptance, I should offer something close to a fair split but still maximize my share. Given the timeout and switching roles, I want my offer to be accepted this time to avoid zero payoffs. A slight reduction from 0.8 to around 0.75 for myself, leaving 0.25 to agent 0, might be accepted by the responder. Thus, I propose to keep 0.75 for myself.",

Given the discounting from the 0.1 stopping probability per step and that the opponent has rejected my 0.8 (which is higher than 0.75), it is unlikely that future offers will be much better than 0.25 for me. Therefore, accepting this proposal (0.25 for me) yields a better guaranteed payoff now than risking a lower or zero payoff by rejecting. Hence, I will accept the offer.",

  "Analysis": "As the proposer at timestep 0, I want to maximize my payoff x while ensuring the responder accepts the offer. The responder will accept only if their payoff (1-x) is greater than or equal to the expected payoff they get if they reject and become proposer in the next round. The game can last up to 10 steps and at each step there is a 0.1 chance the game ends, so the responder's expected value if rejecting includes future bargaining rounds. However, as a self-interested rational player, the responder will demand at least half, as in the alternating offer model with discounting, to accept. Therefore, to secure immediate acceptance and maximize my payoff, I should offer the responder their minimum acceptable share, which is close to 0.5. Offering 0.5 keeps me with 0.5. Offers higher than 0.5 risk rejection, lower than 0.5 risk rejection as well. So I propose x = 0.5.",

  "Analysis": "As the proposer at timestep 0, I want to maximize my expected payoff. If I propose x close to 1, the responder (agent 1) will reject since they would get almost no money and can gain more by switching roles. If I propose too low a value for myself, I lose out on more money than necessary. Considering the game may end with probability 0.1 each round and timeout at 10 rounds, the responder has some incentive to accept a reasonable offer rather than risk nothing later. The equilibrium in alternating offer bargaining often converges to a split near the discounting factor; here, with a 0.1 stop probability, the expected number of rounds is 1/(0.1) = 10. So offering myself about 0.9 is likely too greedy. A more balanced offer around 0.7 (keeping 70%) might be accepted as it leaves 30% to the responder, which is better than the expected zero if they reject and rely on chance. Hence, I will propose x=0.7.",

  "Analysis": "As the responder, accepting the offer means receiving 1 - 0.7 = 0.3. Rejecting the offer leads to switching roles, where I become the proposer at timestep 1 with a 0.1 chance the game will stop prematurely and a max timestep of 10. If I reject, I have a chance to propose a better or equal share to myself, potentially more than 0.3, given that I will try to maximize my own payoff. However, there's risk the game stops or the opponent rejects my offer in return. Given the risk and discount, accepting 0.3 is a guaranteed payoff now, while rejecting offers uncertain future payoffs. Nonetheless, since I am rational and self-interested, I will reject if I believe I can achieve better than 0.3 as the proposer in the next turn. Considering I can propose 0.7 to myself or higher, the proposer is unlikely to accept low offers. Thus, it is rational to reject the current offer to get a potentially better payoff when I am the proposer next.",

The opponent rejected 0.7 because they would get 0.3, which they found insufficient compared to the potential of proposing a better offer when it is their turn. Given the 0.1 probability of the game ending in each step and the limit at timestep 10, both sides have an incentive to accept somewhat fair splits to avoid zero payoff. I should propose an offer that I keep slightly more than half but generous enough to make the opponent accept rather than continue the game. I will propose to keep 0.6 for myself, offering the opponent 0.4. This gives the opponent more than they would have gotten by accepting the previous offer, and they may accept it to avoid the risk of getting nothing.",

  "Analysis": "As the proposer at timestep 0, I want to maximize my share x while ensuring the responder accepts the offer. The responder is self-interested and rational, so they will accept only if their payoff (1 - x) is greater than the expected payoff of rejecting and proposing next round. The game has a 0.1 probability to end each round and a max of 10 rounds total, so the responder values future rounds less due to risk of game ending and role switching. Therefore, the minimal offer that the responder will accept is close to 0, since rejecting leads to uncertain outcomes. To maximize my payoff, I will propose x = 1, keeping all the money. The responder should reject with x=1 because (1-x)=0 and zero payoff is equal to rejecting but with some risk. However, since I know the responder is rational, they will reject if they get nothing. To ensure acceptance, I slightly reduce x to keep 0.9 and give 0.1 to the responder, ensuring they get a positive payoff better than zero from rejection. This ensures acceptance and maximizes my payoff given the responder's rationality.",

If I become the proposer, I can propose a split to maximize my payoff, but the responder could reject. Given the high probability of continuation and the potential to gain more as proposer, rejecting might be advantageous if future expected payoff is >0.1. However, the game can end with no payoff if rejected. As a rational self-interested player, I calculate expected payoff by rejecting: as proposer soon I can offer close to 1 for myself and expect acceptance since the other player prefers any positive payoff over 0. So I can expect >0.1 by rejecting now and proposing next. Therefore, I reject (y=0) option offers higher expected payoff than accepting (y=1) because accepting gives only 0.1 now vs expected >0.1 later.",

  "Analysis": "As the proposer at timestep 0, my goal is to maximize my payoff by offering the smallest amount to the responder that they would accept. Since the responder is rational and self-interested, they will accept any offer x if their expected payoff from acceptance (1 - x) is at least as great as their expected payoff from rejecting and switching roles. On rejecting, the responder would become proposer, expecting a similar negotiation with a chance of timeout. Considering the 0.1 probability of the game ending each iteration and maximum 10 timesteps, the expected payoff from future rounds diminishes, making responders more likely to accept a reasonable offer now. Offering the responder just slightly more than their expected continuation value will likely secure acceptance. A standard solution via backward induction suggests the proposer can keep approximately 0.9 to themselves and offer 0.1 to the responder, as the responder would prefer 0.1 now rather than risk future rounds with potential 0 payoff. Therefore, I will propose to keep 0.9 for myself and give 0.1 to the responder.",

Proposal:
 Now the proposer decides that x=0.9.

If I reject, I become the proposer at timestep 1 with a strong position to propose a split favoring myself.

{
  "Analysis": "As the proposer at timestep 0, I want to maximize my share, but I must offer the responder a share that they find acceptable to avoid rejection and role reversal. The responder is also rational and self-interested, so they will accept if the offer is better than their expected payoff by rejecting and then proposing in the next round. Rejection leads to switching roles and the chance of a lower payoff due to the 0.1 probability of game end per round and only 10 rounds max. Thus, I should offer just enough for the responder to accept—i.e., make an offer where the responder's accepted payoff (1-x) at least matches the expected value of rejecting. If I assume both players behave symmetrically rational, the subgame perfect equilibrium tends to an equal split (x=0.5). Offering slightly more than 0.5 to myself will cause the responder to reject, expecting to improve their payoff when roles switch. Hence, I choose x=0.5 to ensure acceptance and maximize my payoff.",

  "Analysis": "As a responder, I will accept the offer if it gives me a payoff greater than 0, considering that rejecting leads to role reversal and a possible loss of payoff due to timeout or unfavorable counteroffer. Since the proposer offers me 1 - 0.5 = 0.5, which is a decent share, accepting now yields an immediate payoff of 0.5 versus the uncertainty of future rounds. Thus, accepting maximizes my expected payoff.",
