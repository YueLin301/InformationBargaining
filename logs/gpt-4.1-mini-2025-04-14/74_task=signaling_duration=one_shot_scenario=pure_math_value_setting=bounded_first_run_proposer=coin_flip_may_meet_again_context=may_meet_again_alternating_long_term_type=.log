  "Analysis": "As the sender and proposer, I want to maximize my expected payoff. The state is 0 with probability 2/3 and state 1 with probability 1/3. The sender's payoff is 1 when the receiver takes action 1 regardless of state, and 0 for action 0. However, the receiver dislikes taking action 1 when state=0 (penalty -1) and prefers action 1 when state=1. As a self-interested sender, I want the receiver to choose action 1 as often as possible, in particular when state=0. However, if I fully reveal the state (e.g., truthfully signal 1 only when state=1), the receiver can infer the state and may avoid action 1 when state=0, thus lowering my payoff. To maximize my payoff, I will always send signal 1 regardless of the state (x1=1, x2=1). This forces the receiver to base action solely on signal=1 and likely take action 1. This maximizes my expected payoff to 1 regardless of the state realization. The receiver's expected payoff will be a weighted average but may be negative, thus the receiver might want to deviate, but I commit first to this signaling scheme. Any partial separation reduces my payoff. Therefore, the best rational strategy is to always send signal 1 (x1=1, x2=1).",

{
  "Analysis": "The sender commits to always sending signal 1 regardless of the state (x1=1, x2=1). Given this, the receiver receives no informative signal, as sigma=1 is always sent. The receiver's belief after receiving signal 1 matches the prior belief: Pr(s=0)=2/3, Pr(s=1)=1/3. The expected payoffs for receiver when choosing action 0 or 1 are: For action 0, expected payoff is 0; for action 1, expected payoff is (2/3)*(-1) + (1/3)*1 = (-2/3) + (1/3) = -1/3 < 0. So action 0 yields higher payoff. Therefore, the best response for the receiver is to always choose action 0 regardless of the signal, i.e., y1=0 and y2=0. This decision maximizes the receiver's expected utility given the proposer's signaling scheme.",

  "Analysis": "As the sender and proposer, my goal is to maximize my expected payoff. The sender's payoff is 1 whenever the receiver takes action 1, regardless of the true state, while the receiver's payoff is positive only when the state is 1 and the action is 1, zero otherwise, and negative if action 1 is taken in state 0. Given the prior (2/3 chance of state 0) and incentives, the receiver wants to avoid action 1 on signal 0 unless convinced the state is likely 1. To maximize my payoff, I want the receiver to take action 1 as often as possible. Since I can commit to a signaling scheme, the optimal strategy is to always send signal 1 regardless of the state (x1=1, x2=1). This eliminates any informative signal, but makes the receiver's only observed signal 1, which should push them to take action 1 optimally conditional on that signal. Given that with signal always 1, the posterior equals the prior, receiver's best response is likely to take action 1 with some probability to maximize their own payoff, which would be below 1 but possibly positive with strengthening incentives induced by the uniform signal. This maximizes my expected payoff because receiver would be more likely to take action 1. Thus, I commit to the signaling scheme: send signal 1 always (x1=1, x2=1).",

The receiver's payoff is 0 if action=0, and either -1 (state=0) or 1 (state=1) if action=1. Expected receiver payoff for action=1 based on prior is (2/3)*(-1) + (1/3)*1 = -1/3 < 0.

  "Analysis": "As the receiver and proposer, I want to propose a signaling scheme varphi_1 that incentivizes the sender to comply so that my expected payoff is at least as good as ignoring the signals (pi_0). Without any signaling, the receiver's expected payoff from always taking action 0 (safe) is zero because taking action 1 in state 0 yields negative payoff. The sender's payoffs prefer action 1, but this harms me. Ideally, I want the sender to reveal the state truthfully or partially so I can take action 1 only in state 1 to maximize my expected payoff. If the sender is fully revealing, then the receiver can take action 1 in signal=1 and 0 in signal=0, achieving an expected receiver payoff of (1/3)*1 + (2/3)*0 = 1/3 (~0.333). The sender might not agree because in state 0 sender prefers action 1, which harms the receiver. To balance, I propose a partial signaling: sender sends signal 1 with probability 1 when s=1 (x2=1), and signal 1 with probability 0 (x1=0) when s=0 to maximize the informativeness and my payoff while giving sender no incentive to deviate. This would allow me to set pi(a=1|sigma=1)=1 and pi(a=1|sigma=0)=0, leading to expected receiver payoff 1/3, better than 0. Thus, the proposed varphi_1 is (x1=0, x2=1).",

This perfectly reveals the state to the receiver without noise. Since the receiver's payoff is higher by taking action=1 only when s=1 (receiver payoff is 1 if s=1 and a=1, negative if s=0 and a=1), the rational best response is to take action=0 when receiving signal=0 (indicating s=0), and action=1 when receiving signal=1 (indicating s=1). This maximizes the receiver's expected payoff, and hence is a best response.",

  "Analysis": "As the receiver proposer, I want to propose a signaling scheme varphi_1 that the sender can commit to, such that if the sender does, I will follow the posterior-dependent action rule pi_1. Otherwise, I will follow pi_0, ignoring the signals. The goal is to induce a signaling scheme that makes me better off than ignoring the sender's information. Given the sender's payoffs, the sender wants to encourage action=1 in both states while I, the receiver, suffer a loss at state=0 if I choose action=1, but gain at state=1 for action=1. My best response ignoring the sender's signals (pi_0) is to take action 0, since the prior expected payoff for action=1 is (2/3)*(-1)+(1/3)*(1) = -2/3 + 1/3 = -1/3 < 0. If the sender signals perfectly, separating the states, I can respond to signal=0 with action=0 (expecting state 0) and signal=1 with action=1 (expecting state 1), yielding a higher expected payoff. Thus, the receiver proposes a fully separating signaling scheme varphi_1 where signal=0 is sent only if state=0 (x1=0), and signal=1 only if state=1 (x2=1). This induces receiver's posterior beliefs equal to the true state and justifies pi_1 with y1=0, y2=1. The sender's expected payoff from this signaling scheme is 2/3*0 + 1/3*1 = 1/3 (sending signal 1 with state 1 only), but it is beneficial because the receiver follows action 1 only when state=1, so sender's payoff is maximized without the receiver choosing action 1 when state=0. This is the best enforceable signaling scheme to induce rational behavior, maximizing the receiver's payoff compared to pooling where expected utility is negative. Therefore, I propose varphi_1 = [0, 1].",

  "Analysis": "As the receiver and proposer, I want to design a signaling scheme varphi_1 for the sender to follow, to maximize my own expected payoff. The sender benefits by inducing action=1 in both states, as it always gets 1 when action=1 regardless of the state. The receiver gains when action=1 is taken in state=1 but loses (-1) if action=1 is taken in state=0. Prior probabilities are mu_0(0)=2/3 and mu_0(1)=1/3. Ideally, I want the sender signaling scheme to help me distinguish state=1 signals (where I take action=1) from state=0 signals (where I take action=0), to avoid losses on state=0. A fully separating scheme where sender signals 1 if s=1 and 0 if s=0 (i.e., x1=0, x2=1) gives me perfect information and allows me to take action 1 only when s=1, maximizing my payoff: I act a=1 on sigma=1 and a=0 on sigma=0. This yields expected payoff mu_0(1)*1 = 1/3 for me and sender expected payoff of 1/3 * 1 + 2/3 * 0 = 1/3. However, sender prefers to always get payoff 1, so might deviate by sending always sigma=1 (x1=1, x2=1), which makes me unable to distinguish states and forced to best respond to prior, acting a=1 always, getting expected payoff -1*2/3 + 1*1/3 = -1/3, which is worse. Hence, the signaling scheme (0,1) is incentive compatible and best for me. I propose varphi_1 with x1=0 and x2=1. If sender follows this, I will play pi_1 (best response to posterior), else, I will play pi_0 (best response to prior). This incentivizes sender to adopt (0,1) signaling scheme as it yields receiver payoff 1/3, better than any other scheme receiver expected payoff when sender deviates. Therefore, my proposed varphi_1 is (0,1).",

The receiver's optimal response is to take action 0 when sigma=0 to avoid the negative payoff (-1) that occurs if action=1 is taken in state=0, and take action 1 when sigma=1 to gain payoff 1.

  "Analysis": "As the sender and proposer, I want to design a signaling scheme that maximizes my expected payoff. Given the state distribution mu_0(0)=2/3 and mu_0(1)=1/3, and that I get reward 1 whenever the receiver takes action 1 regardless of state, my best strategy is to induce the receiver to choose action 1 with high probability. The receiver incurs a cost if they choose action 1 when state=0 (payoff -1) but gains payoff 1 when state=1 and action=1, so the receiver's incentive aligns with choosing action 1 only when the posterior belief of state=1 is sufficiently high. My signaling can manipulate this belief.

If I always send signal 1 regardless of state (x1=1, x2=1), the receiver's posterior belief of state=1 given sigma=1 is just the prior 1/3, which is too low for them to optimally choose action 1. The receiver will choose action 0, giving me zero reward.

If I separate perfectly (x1=0, x2=1), signal 0 always from state=0 and signal 1 from state=1, the receiver's posteriors become either 1 for signal 1 or 0 for signal 0. Thus, receiver will choose action 1 when signal=1 and action 0 when signal=0, maximizing receiver's payoff. This benefits me as well because in state=1, action 1 yields me reward 1, and in state=0, action 0 yields me 0 (no risk of receiver punishing with action 1).

The receiver's action 1 on signal 0 would cause me to be worse off when state=0 if I send signal 0 there, so the basic separating scheme (x1=0, x2=1) is incentive compatible and optimal.

Hence, I will choose the fully separating signaling scheme (x1=0, x2=1). This will induce the receiver to best respond by choosing a1=0 on sigma=0 and a1=1 on sigma=1, maximizing my payoff. Any mixing would only reduce my expected payoff or be rejected by the receiver."

  "Analysis": "As the sender and proposer, I want to design a signaling scheme that maximizes my expected payoff. The sender always gains 1 when the receiver chooses action 1, regardless of the state, and 0 otherwise. The receiver, however, suffers a loss (-1) if it chooses action 1 in state 0, and gains +1 if it chooses action 1 in state 1. Prior probabilities favor state 0 (2/3), so the receiver would be reluctant to choose action 1 unless the signal strongly indicates state 1.\n\nIf I reveal full information (x1=0, x2=1), the receiver, being rational, will respond accordingly: taking action 0 on signal 0 (likely state 0) and action 1 on signal 1 (likely state 1). Hence, I get payoff 1 with probability 1/3 (state 1 correctly signaled with signal 1). In state 0, receiver chooses action 0, so sender payoff 0 there.\n\nIf I pool signals (e.g., x1=x2), the receiver cannot distinguish states and will act based on prior, which leads the receiver to act 0 always (since expected receiver payoff for action 1 under prior is negative: (2/3)*(-1)+(1/3)*(1) = -1/3 < 0). In this case, the sender gets zero payoff.\n\nIf I try to mislead by sending signal 1 in state 0 with some positive probability, receiver will update posterior beliefs accordingly and may choose action 0 more often, reducing sender payoff.\n\nTherefore, the best for me is to fully reveal the state: send signal 0 when s=0, and signal 1 when s=1 (x1=0, x2=1), which induces receiver to respond optimally and maximizes my expected payoff: 1 * 1/3 = 1/3.\n\nNo deviation improves my payoff. So, the signaling scheme is: \n- x1=0 (never send signal 1 in state 0)\n- x2=1 (always send signal 1 in state 1)",

  "Analysis": "As the sender and proposer, I want to design a signaling scheme that maximizes my own expected payoff. The sender's payoff is 1 whenever the receiver takes action 1, regardless of the state. However, the receiver's payoffs differ between states, and they are rational and self-interested. The receiver will respond to signals by updating their beliefs and choosing actions accordingly. Knowing the prior probabilities, the receiver prefers action 0 when the belief that the state is 1 is less than 0.5 (since action 1 would yield expected 0 * 2/3 + 1 * 1/3 for sender but receiver expects losses if action 1 chosen wrongly in state 0). The sender prefers the receiver to take action 1 regardless of the state. To maximize sender's payoff, I should ensure that the receiver finds it optimal to choose action 1 at both signals, or at least have a high probability of choosing action 1 after receiving either signal. The best signaling scheme for the sender is to send the same signal regardless of state (babbling equilibrium), so the receiver cannot distinguish states and picks the best response to the prior. Given the prior (2/3 for state 0, 1/3 for state 1), the receiver's expected payoff for action 0 is 0, and for action 1 is (2/3)*(-1) + (1/3)*1 = -1/3 < 0, so receiver prefers action 0 when ignoring signals. Hence, if sender does not separate signals, receiver will play a=0, yielding sender payoff 0. Alternatively, sender can try separating signals to induce the receiver to choose a=1 when the state is 1 (to get sender payoff 1 in that state) and a=0 when the state is 0 (to avoid receiver losses and encourage action 1 in state 1). But this requires credible signaling to persuade receiver to take action 1 only on signal 1 (corresponding to state 1). Hence, set x1=0 and x2=1 (signaling 0 for s=0 and 1 for s=1) creating fully revealing signals. The receiver, when rational, will choose action 0 following signal 0 (state 0) and action 1 following signal 1 (state 1). The sender payoff is then mu_0(0)*0 + mu_0(1)*1 = 1/3, better than babbling strategy. This is incentive compatible for the sender because sending signal 1 when state is 0 yields risk of receiver choosing action 1 leading to receiver loss and possible retaliation if the roles switched in the future. Thus, the best commitment is separating signals fully: x1=0, x2=1.",

  "Analysis": "The sender's signaling scheme is fully separating: signal 0 indicates state 0 with certainty, and signal 1 indicates state 1 with certainty. Therefore, given signal 0, the posterior belief of state=0 is 1, and given signal 1, the posterior belief of state=1 is 1. The receiver can fully trust the signal. Based on the reward structure, the receiver's optimal action is to take action 0 when the state is 0 (since action 1 causes receiver payoff -1) and action 1 when the state is 1 (since action 1 causes receiver payoff 1).

  "Analysis": "As the sender and proposer, I aim to maximize my expected payoff. The sender's payoff is 1 whenever the receiver's action is 1, irrespective of state. Since my payoff from (s=0, a=1) and (s=1, a=1) is 1, I want the receiver to choose action=1 as often as possible. However, the receiver faces a trade-off: for s=0, action=1 gives them -1 payoff, and for s=1, action=1 gives them +1. The prior probability of s=0 is 2/3 and s=1 is 1/3. Without information, the receiver's best response is a=0 because expected payoff of a=1 is (2/3)*(-1)+(1/3)*(1) = -1/3 < 0. So the receiver would choose action=0 if ignoring signals. To induce the receiver to choose action=1 at least sometimes, I need to provide informative signals. However, given that the receiver is rational and self-interested, when they receive the signal, they will compute the posterior and maximize their payoff accordingly. Because I can randomize signals, I can design a signaling scheme to partially reveal information that makes the posterior belief for signal 1 to favor s=1 enough to justify action=1, and for signal 0 to favor s=0 enough to justify action=0. This will induce the receiver to take the desired action 1 some of the time, increasing my expected payoff. Concretely, I can commit to a signaling scheme: signal 1 with some probability x2 when s=1, and signal 1 with some probability x1 when s=0 (where x1 < x2). By choosing x1=0 and x2=1 (fully revealing), the receiver will act optimally: a=0 on sigma=0 (mostly s=0), a=1 on sigma=1 (s=1). This leads to sender expected payoff:  (2/3)*0 + (1/3)*1 = 1/3. Alternatively, I could also send signal 1 all the time (x1=1, x2=1), so receiver gets no info and acts on prior, which leads to receiver choosing a=0 (since expected payoff negative), yielding sender payoff 0. So the fully revealing strategy is better for me. Therefore, my optimal choice is the fully revealing signaling scheme (x1=0, x2=1).",

  "Analysis": "As the receiver and proposer, I want to design a signaling scheme varphi_1 that induces the sender to choose a signaling scheme that maximizes my expected payoff when I use pi_1 (best response to posterior beliefs). Given the payoffs, the sender gets 1 whenever the receiver takes action 1, regardless of state, while I get -1 if action 1 is taken in state 0 and +1 if action 1 is taken in state 1. The prior probability of state 0 is 2/3 and state 1 is 1/3. Without any information, my best response is to action 0 always, since expected payoff = (2/3)*0 + (1/3)*0 = 0 vs (2/3)*(-1) + (1/3)*1 = -1/3 <0 if acting 1 always. However, with signals, I may take action 1 selectively based on posterior beliefs. For the sender to reveal information credibly, the signaling scheme should separate signals to make me take action 1 only when I strongly believe the state is 1, thus increasing my expected payoff. One signaling scheme that encourages informative signaling is varphi_1: sender sends sigma=0 with s=0 and sigma=1 with s=1, i.e. x1=0, x2=1. This enables me to act optimally: pi_0 would yield expected payoff 0; pi_1 can condition on sigma and take action 1 only when sigma=1, getting an expected receiver payoff of (1/3)*1=1/3 >0. This is better than prior action 0 always. By announcing this signaling scheme and promising to follow pi_1 if the sender's expected payoff under the chosen scheme is at least as high as under varphi_1, I incentivize the sender to follow this scheme or similar. Thus, the best signaling scheme to propose is varphi_1 with x1=0 and x2=1.",

    "Analysis": "The sender's signaling scheme is fully revealing: when the state is 0, signal 1 is never sent (x1=0); when the state is 1, signal 1 is always sent (x2=1). Therefore, the signal perfectly reveals the state. As a rational receiver, upon receiving sigma=0, I infer s=0 with probability 1, so I should take action a=1 only if it benefits me. When s=0, action a=1 yields a receiver payoff of -1, while a=0 yields 0. So the best response is a=0 with probability 1 upon sigma=0. Upon receiving sigma=1, the inferred state is s=1 with probability 1. In this case, action a=1 yields receiver payoff 1, and a=0 yields 0, so I should take action a=1 with probability 1. Therefore, the best response action rule is to take a=0 when sigma=0 and a=1 when sigma=1, i.e., y1=0 and y2=1.",

{
    "Analysis": "As the receiver and proposer, I want to design a signaling scheme varphi_1 that the sender (who will respond) must satisfy to ensure I prefer the responsive action rule pi_1 that uses posterior beliefs rather than pi_0 that ignores signals. The receiver's payoff depends on choosing action 1 only when the state is 1, yielding a payoff of 1; choosing action 1 when state is 0 yields -1. The receiver's best response to prior (pi_0) is to always choose action 0 since the expected payoff from always choosing 1 is negative (due to the 2/3 prior on state=0). To induce the sender to commit to a signaling scheme that benefits me at least as much as some baseline, I must propose a signaling scheme that separates the states or at least makes signals informative enough for me to act selectively. A natural signaling scheme is full separation: send signal 0 when state=0 and signal 1 when state=1 (x1=0, x2=1). This allows me to select action 0 upon signal 0 (safe) and action 1 upon signal 1 (gain 1), maximizing my expected payoff. This maximizes my payoff and induces sender compliance, since sender gains 1 payoff regardless of action (both actions yield sender payoff 1 in state=1 or 0 when action=1, but in state=0 if action=1, receiver gets -1). Sender's payoff is always 1 for action=1, so sender chooses signal 1 in state 1 and signal 0 in state 0. Therefore, the recommended signaling scheme is x1=0 (never send 1 in state 0), and x2=1 (always send 1 in state 1).",

 Now the proposer decides that x1=0 and x2=1.

  "Analysis": "Given the sender's committed signaling scheme where the sender sends signal 0 with probability 1 when the state is 0 (x1=0) and signal 1 with probability 1 when the state is 1 (x2=1), the receiver's posterior beliefs on signal perfectly correlate with the state. Upon receiving signal 0, the receiver is sure the state is 0, and upon receiving signal 1, the receiver is sure the state is 1. Since the receiver aims to maximize its expected payoff, it should choose action 0 (gives 0 payoff) when signal is 0 to avoid the -1 penalty associated with action 1 in state 0, and action 1 when signal is 1 to secure a positive payoff of 1. Hence, y1=0 and y2=1 is the best response action rule.",

  "Analysis": "As the sender and proposer, my goal is to maximize my expected payoff. The payoff for me is 1 whenever the receiver chooses action 1 regardless of the state. The receiver's payoff is positive only for state=1 and action=1 but negative for state=0 and action=1. The receiver is rational and self-interested, so it is reluctant to take action 1 when the signal does not provide sufficient information. Given the prior, the receiver would prefer action 0 without informative signals since the expected payoff from action 1 without posterior updating is negative (due to high probability of state=0 where action 1 causes loss to receiver). To induce the receiver to take action 1 more often (which gives me positive payoff), I need to provide informative signals allowing the receiver to distinguish state 1 from state 0. The best way is to send signal 1 with high probability when state=1 and signal 0 when state=0, i.e., a truthful signaling scheme: phi(1|0)=0 and phi(1|1)=1. This allows the receiver to take action 1 mainly when signal 1 is received (which is informative about state=1), optimizing the receiver's payoff and inducing the desired action to maximize my payoff. Randomizing or mixing signals would dilute informativeness and reduce receiver's incentive to take action 1. Thus, the best sender strategy is to signal 0 for state 0 and 1 for state 1 with probability 1 each.",

Given this perfect information, the receiver's best response is to take action 1 when receiving signal 1 (which corresponds to state 1), gaining a reward of 1, and action 0 when receiving signal 0 (which corresponds to state 0), gaining a reward of 0 (better than -1 from action 1 in state 0).

  "Analysis": "As the sender and proposer, I want to maximize my expected payoff. The sender's reward is 1 if the receiver takes action 1 regardless of the state, and 0 otherwise. Given the prior distribution (2/3 for state 0 and 1/3 for state 1), and that the receiver acts rationally to maximize their own payoffs, I want to design a signaling scheme that induces the receiver to choose action 1 as often as possible. However, the receiver gets negative payoff (-1) for action 1 when state is 0, and positive payoff (+1) for action 1 when state is 1. The receiver must infer from the signals and maximize their expected payoff.

If the sender always sends signal 1 regardless of the state (x1=1, x2=1), the receiver's posterior following signal 1 is just the prior mixture, i.e., the probability of state 0 is 2/3 and state 1 is 1/3. Then the expected receiver payoff for taking action 1 is (2/3)*(-1) + (1/3)*(1) = -1/3 < 0, so the receiver prefers action 0 always.

Similarly, if the sender always sends signal 0, the receiver again has no incentive to choose action 1.

The sender can benefit from pooling partially or fully separating.

If the sender fully separates signals: x1=0 (signal 1 triggered only at state 1), x2=1 (state 1 always signals 1), the receiver interprets signal 1 as state 1 with certainty, so takes action 1 and sender gains payoff 1 in state 1, but when signal 0 is received, the receiver updates belief to state 0 with probability 1 and chooses action 0, sender gets 0 in state 0.

Expected sender payoff = mu0(0)*0 + mu0(1)*1 = 1/3.

If the sender pools with some probabilities, can sender get better?

Consider x1=0, x2=1: sender payoff 1/3.

Consider x1=1, x2=1 (always signal 1): receiver aware of prior; receiver expects negative payoff taking action 1, so will choose action 0, sender payoff 0.

Consider x1=1, x2=0 (send signal 1 when state 0, signal 0 when state 1): receiver sees signal 1, which indicates state 0, receiver chooses action 0; signal 0 indicates state 1, receiver chooses action 1, sender gets payoff only for state 1 taking action 1, so expected payoff 1/3.

Similar reasoning indicates that fully separating signals yields sender payoff 1/3.

Consider mixing to confuse receiver: if the sender sends signal 1 with some probability alpha in state 0 and beta in state 1.

Receiver computes posterior probability of state 1 given signal 1:

P(s=1 | sigma=1) = mu0(1)*beta / (mu0(0)*alpha + mu0(1)*beta) = (1/3)*beta / ((2/3)*alpha + (1/3)*beta).

Receiver chooses action 1 if expected payoff >= 0:

Expected payoff for action 1 given signal 1 = P(s=0 | sigma=1)*(-1) + P(s=1 | sigma=1)*(1) >= 0.

This means:

P(s=1 | sigma=1) - P(s=0 | sigma=1) >= 0

Or equivalently:

2*P(s=1 | sigma=1) -1 >=0

=> P(s=1 | sigma=1) >= 0.5.

Thus, receiver chooses action 1 if posterior prob of state 1 >= 0.5.

Similarly for signal 0.

Therefore, by mixing alpha and beta, sender can try to get receiver to take action 1 more often, but to get receiver to choose action 1 on signal 1, the posterior prob of state 1 must be at least 0.5.

Try to set alpha and beta so that:

(1/3)*beta / ((2/3)*alpha + (1/3)*beta) >= 0.5 --> (1/3)*beta >= 0.5*((2/3)*alpha + (1/3)*beta) --> (1/3)*beta >= (1/3)*alpha + (1/6)*beta --> (1/3)*beta - (1/6)*beta >= (1/3)*alpha --> (1/6)*beta >= (1/3)*alpha --> beta >= 2*alpha.

Similarly, to ensure receiver chooses action 0 on signal 0, the posterior prob of state 1 given sigma=0 must be less than 0.5.

P(s=1 | sigma=0) = (1/3)*(1 - beta) / [ (2/3)*(1 - alpha) + (1/3)*(1 - beta) ] < 0.5

After some algebra, this implies:

beta < 2*alpha

This is a contradiction unless beta exactly equals 2*alpha. So no strict inequality.

If beta=2*alpha, then posterior prob of state 1 given sigma=1 is exactly 0.5; same for sigma=0, which makes the receiver indifferent.

Receiver being rational, may mix action 1 with probability 0.5 when indifferent.

Hence, choosing beta=2*alpha yields a pooling equilibrium.

Example, pick alpha=0, beta=0:

full separation with x1=0 x2=0 : no, because beta=0.

Wait, this boundary case corresponds to partial pooling.

To maximize sender's expected value, sender wants the receiver to choose action 1 as often as possible.

Analyze the payoff:

Sender expected payoff =

mu0(0) * [ (1 - x1) * y1 + x1 * y2 ] + mu0(1) * [ (1 - x2) * y1 + x2 * y2 ]

Assuming the receiver follows best response to posterior beliefs, receiver's behavior is determined.

Hence, the best sender strategy is full separation: x1=0 (send sigma=0 in state 0), x2=1 (send sigma=1 in state 1). Receiver on sigma=1 chooses action 1, on sigma=0 chooses action 0.

Expected sender payoff = mu0(1)*1 = 1/3, which is better than any pooling where receiver always chooses action 0.

Therefore, the signaling scheme is:

x1 = 0 (signal 1 with prob 0 in state 0)

x2 = 1 (signal 1 with prob 1 in state 1)

Thus, the receiver will infer perfectly the state and choose action 1 only when state=1, maximizing sender's payoff.

This is the best sustainable equilibrium under rationality and own-payoff maximization, given the receiver's incentives."

    "Analysis": "As the sender and proposer, my goal is to design a signaling scheme (x1, x2) maximizing my expected payoff, anticipating that the receiver will respond rationally. The sender gets payoff 1 when the receiver chooses action 1 regardless of state. The receiver prefers action 1 only when the state is 1; action 1 in state 0 penalizes the receiver. Receivers update beliefs based on my signaling scheme and signal received to maximize their own payoff. If I fully reveal the state (x1=0 for s=0 and x2=1 for s=1), the receiver can perfectly identify state=1 signals and choose action 1 only then. But in state 0, receiver chooses action 0, so sender gets 0 there. If I pool signals (e.g., always send sigma=1), receiver will not distinguish states and will act on prior. Prior probability state=1 is 1/3, which is less than 1/2, so receiver prefers action 0 always, giving me zero payoff. Alternatively, if I send signal 1 always when s=0 (x1=1) and also when s=1 (x2=1), the receiver infers all signal 1, so still no gain. To get receiver to take action 1 more often, I want to send signal 1 more in state 0 (to get action 1 with payoff 1), but receiver will update posterior to believe state=0 more and respond accordingly. The equilibrium signaling scheme is to send signal 1 always (x1=1), send signal 1 never (x2=0), inducing the receiver to choose action 1 on signal 0 and 0 on signal 1 or vice versa. But this is unstable because the receiver's best response depends on posterior over states given signals. Since state 0 is more likely a priori, the receiver will not take action 1 on a signal common in state 0. Therefore, fully pooling or full separation schemes each have problems. The best for sender is to "pool": send signal 1 independently of state (x1=x2=1), so receiver ignores signal and picks action 0 due to low belief in state 1, so sender payoff 0, or send signal 1 always to encourage action 1, but receiver will not respond. Alternatively, mix signals such that receiver's posterior belief on signal 1 is larger than 1/2, so receiver prefers action 1 on signal 1, and on signal 0 prefers action 0. Since prior of state 1 is 1/3, if probability of signal 1 conditional on state 0 is x1 and conditional on state 1 is x2, the receiver's posterior belief after signal 1 is p = (1/3)*x2 / [ (2/3)*x1 + (1/3)*x2 ]. Choose x1 and x2 such that p > 1/2 to get receiver to take action 1 on signal 1. Similarly, on signal 0, posterior belief is likely below 1/2 so choose action 0. Setting x1=0, x2=1 ensures signal 1 only if state=1; signal 0 only if state=0. Receiver then perfectly infers and takes action 1 on signal 1 and 0 on signal 0. Sender's expected payoff is mu_0(s=1)*1 + mu_0(s=0)*0 = 1/3. That is the best attainable payoff for sender, since in state 0 receiver takes action 0 (payoff 0), in state 1 receiver takes action 1 (payoff 1). So optimal signaling scheme is (x1=0, x2=1).",

  "Analysis": "As the sender, I want to maximize my expected payoff. The sender's payoff is 1 if the receiver takes action 1 regardless of the state since r^i(s,a=1)=1 for both s=0 and s=1, and 0 otherwise. The receiver prefers action 1 only when the state is 1 (because r^j(s=1,a=1)=1 and r^j(s=0,a=1)=-1). If I reveal the state perfectly (x1=0, x2=1), the receiver can distinguish state 0 and 1 reliably, taking action 0 when s=0, and action 1 when s=1, resulting in expected sender payoff: (2/3)*0 + (1/3)*1=1/3, which is low. However, if I fully pool signals (x1=1, x2=1), always sending signal 1, then receiver's posterior is still the prior (since the signal does not differentiate), the receiver believes state=0 with probability 2/3 and state=1 with 1/3, and must choose an action maximizing its expected payoff. The receiver's expected payoff for action 1 is (2/3)*(-1) + (1/3)*1 = -1/3, so receiver prefers action 0 and sender gets 0. If I always send signal 0 (x1=0, x2=0), the situation symmetrically applies and sender gets payoff 0. To induce the receiver to take action 1 with high probability, I must send a signal that makes the receiver have a posterior belief that the probability of state=1 is high enough to prefer action 1. The receiver prefers action 1 if posterior Pr(s=1 | sigma) >= 0.5. I can design a partial pooling signaling scheme to increase the posterior probability for signal=1 above 0.5. For example, send signal=1 in state 1 with probability 1, and in state 0 with probability x1 between 0 and some value less than 1 ensuring the posterior on signal=1 leads receiver to take action 1. Given that, the best sender payoff occurs if receiver responds with pi(a=1 | sigma=1)=1 and pi(a=1 | sigma=0)=0 (action based on posterior), and sender sends signal 1 only when s=1, or sends signal 1 with small probability when s=0 to keep the posterior high. Maximizing sender payoff leads to choosing x1=0, x2=1, i.e., fully separating signaling scheme. Although it yields low sender payoff (1/3), it leads to action 1 being taken only when s=1, which is better for sender than pooling. Therefore, I choose the fully revealing signaling scheme (x1=0, x2=1).",

{
  "Analysis": "Given the sender's signaling scheme where signal 1 is never sent when state=0 (x1=0) and always sent when state=1 (x2=1), the signal perfectly reveals the state. The receiver can therefore perfectly update its belief upon receiving a signal. When signal=0, the receiver knows state=0 with probability 1; when signal=1, the receiver knows state=1 with probability 1. Since the receiver's payoffs are: 0 for action=0 when state=0, -1 for action=1 when state=0, 0 for action=0 when state=1, and 1 for action=1 when state=1, the receiver maximizes expected payoff by choosing a=0 upon signal=0 and a=1 upon signal=1. Therefore, the optimal action rule is pi(a=1|sigma=0) = 0 and pi(a=1|sigma=1) = 1.",
