  "Analysis": "As the receiver proposing a signaling scheme, my goal is to incentivize the sender to reveal as much truthful information as possible so I can distinguish good products from bad ones, which maximizes my expected payoff. Since the sender wants to maximize sales regardless of product quality, they may be incentivized to always send a signal recommending the product (sigma=1). To prevent this, the signaling scheme I propose should include some informativeness — i.e., different probabilities of sending signal 1 for good and bad products. A separating strategy where good products are always signaled as 1 and bad products as 0 makes sense because it allows me to condition my buying action on signals and buy only when signal=1, which aligns with maximizing my payoff. Therefore, I propose the signaling scheme: varphi(sigma=1|s=0) = 0, varphi(sigma=1|s=1) = 1. If the sender commits to this, I will follow pi_1: buy only when signal=1, giving me expected payoff from good products bought minus no losses from bad products. This proposal should give the sender an incentive to follow it by ensuring some sales on good products, and me better expected payoff than no informativeness.",

  "Analysis": "As the sender, my goal is to maximize the number of products sold. Selling both good and bad products yields a payoff of 1 each. Since the receiver will respond to the signals I send, I want to influence their buying decision in a way that maximizes my sales. The prior probability of good products is 1/3 and bad products is 2/3. If I send signal 1 for all products (regardless of quality), the buyer has no informative signal and will act based on the prior belief, which would likely lead to a low purchase rate due to the risk of buying bad products. However, since the buyer is self-interested and rational, they will buy if the expected payoff is positive. The buyer's expected payoff for buying under prior is (1/3)*1 + (2/3)*(-1) = -1/3 < 0, so without informative signaling, receiver won't buy. To maximize sales, I should send signal 1 only for bad products to induce the buyer to buy more, but the buyer will not trust that signal unless also good products are signaled similarly, otherwise the buyer detects deception and the signal loses credibility. Due to conflicting incentives, the separating equilibrium is unlikely here because bad products incur losses for the buyer. A pooling strategy of always recommending (x1=1, x2=1) leads the buyer to not buy due to low expected payoff. Another pooling strategy of never recommending (x1=0, x2=0) leads to zero sales. But if I recommend all (x1=1, x2=1), sales are 100%, giving me payoff 1 per product but buyer retaliates by not buying. The buyer acts after observing signals according to their best response, so the only stable signaling scheme that maximizes my sales is to recommend all products (x1=1, x2=1), hoping to sell all despite the buyer's expected payoff being negative. The buyer cannot refuse to buy all if they want to potentially get good products. So I propose to always send signal 1, i.e., recommend all products.",

  "Analysis": "As the sender, my goal is to maximize the number of products sold, regardless of product quality. Since I gain a reward of 1 for every sale (whether the product is good or bad), I prefer that the receiver buys as many products as possible. However, the receiver is rational and self-interested, wanting to avoid buying bad products since that results in a penalty. Given the prior, the receiver's expected payoff from buying without any signals is negative (since bad products are 2/3 and yield -1 payoff, while good products are 1/3 and yield +1). Therefore, the receiver will tend to avoid buying if no information is provided. To encourage buying, I can use signals to convince the buyer that the product is good, but I must consider that if I over-signal (e.g., always recommend), the receiver will infer that signal 1 is uninformative and not buy. This leads to partial pooling or a separating equilibrium. To maximize sales, the best strategy is to always recommend both bad and good products (send signal 1 always, i.e., x1=1, x2=1), which maximizes sales volume without conditioning the receiver to ignore recommendations. Given the receiver is rational, they will infer that signal 1 is always sent, so buying after signal 1 is equivalent to buying blindly. Since buying blindly is unattractive to the receiver (expected payoff negative), they may not buy, but I will still gain at least some sales if the receiver chooses to ignore and buy probabilistically. Compared to any signal differentiation, this fully mixed recommendation maximizes my sales opportunities. Hence, I choose x1=1, x2=1.",

 Now the proposer decides that x1=1 and x2=1.

This means that the signal provides no information about the state because both good and bad products are signaled identically. Since the receiver sees only signal 1, the posterior belief about the product quality equals the prior: probability good is 1/3, bad is 2/3. The receiver must decide whether to buy or not solely based on prior beliefs. Expected payoff of buying is (1/3)*1 + (2/3)*(-1) = 1/3 - 2/3 = -1/3 < 0, so buying yields negative expected payoff, while not buying yields zero payoff.

  "Analysis": "As the sender, my goal is to maximize the number of products sold regardless of quality. Given the receiver is self-interested and rational, they will buy only if their expected payoff is non-negative. Since bad products yield -1 to the receiver and good products yield +1, the receiver will buy only if the posterior probability of high quality (signal=1) is at least 0.5. To maximize sales, I want to manipulate signals to increase the receiver's willingness to buy. Sending signal 1 for both good and bad products (x1 = 1, x2 = 1) makes the receiver unable to distinguish quality, leading to a posterior that equals the prior: 1/3 good and 2/3 bad. Since expected payoff for the receiver if buying is (1/3)*1 + (2/3)*(-1) = -1/3 < 0, the receiver will not buy when signal equals 1 or 0 under rational play. Alternatively, if I fully separate signals (x1=0, x2=1), sending signal 1 only for good products, then the posterior on signal=1 is fully good (prob=1), so receiver buys signal=1 always and not signal=0. That yields sales only for good products (1/3) and none for bad products (2/3). That maximizes my payoff at 1/3. If I pool signals (sending signal=1 for all) then receiver will not buy since expected value negative. If I send signal=1 always (x1=1, x2=1), receiver will buy nothing. The best I can do is separate perfectly: x1=0, x2=1 to get sales from all good products. However, I can consider partial pooling to try to trick buyer into buying bad products with some probability. But receiver being rational will respond accordingly, buying only when expected payoff >=0. Considering this, partial pooling will at best match the previous separated signaling since buyer adapts actions. Therefore, the best signaling is fully separating, maximizing sales for good products only. So I choose x1=0, x2=1.",

  "Analysis": "The sender's signaling scheme is fully separating: signal 1 is sent if and only if the product is good (s=1), and signal 0 is sent if and only if the product is bad (s=0). As the receiver, given this perfect separation, the posterior on sigma=1 is that the product is good with probability 1, and on sigma=0 the product is bad with probability 1. Therefore, for signal 1, the expected payoff of buying is 1 (positive), so action=1 (buy) is strictly better. For signal 0, the expected payoff of buying is -1 (negative), so action=0 (not buy) is strictly better. Thus, the best response is to buy if sigma=1 and not buy if sigma=0, i.e. y1=0 and y2=1.",

  "Analysis": "As the receiver and proposer, my goal is to design a signaling scheme varphi_1 (i.e., recommend probabilities x1 and x2) that motivates the sender to reveal product quality truthfully or at least in a manner that yields a higher expected payoff for me if I follow the rational posterior-based action rule pi_1 than if I ignore the signals and rely on the prior (pi_0). The sender wants to maximize sales, so they prefer to have products marked to increase purchase likelihood, even if products are low quality. Since the buyer suffers a penalty for buying low quality, the buyer's best response after signal sigma = 0 or 1 depends on the posterior belief of the product's quality. The prior probability of a good product is 1/3, so the buyer will buy if the expected quality (posterior) given a signal is above 0.5. To credibly incentivize the sender to differentiate, I can propose a semi-pooling scheme with x1 = 0 (never recommend bad products) and x2 = 1 (always recommend good products). With these values, the buyer can trust signal 1 indicates good quality with probability 1, and signal 0 indicates bad quality with probability 1. This encourages sender to be truthful, and gives me the incentive to buy upon signal 1 and not buy upon signal 0. This is better payoff for me than acting on the prior (where buying always or not buying always yields zero expected payoff). Therefore, this scheme maximizes my expected payoff while still being viable for the sender since all recommended products are sold and non-recommended products are not. Hence, I propose x1 = 0, x2 = 1 in the signaling scheme varphi_1.",

Proposal:
 Now the proposer decides that x1=0 and x2=1.

  "Analysis": "As the receiver and proposer, I want to design a signaling scheme varphi_1 for the sender such that when I follow pi_1 (best response to posterior beliefs), the sender is incentivized to adopt this scheme or another that grants me at least as high a reward. The prior indicates that only 1/3 of products are good (s=1), and 2/3 are bad (s=0). Since the sender wants to maximize sales and gains 1 for each sale regardless of quality, their incentive is to get the buyer to buy as many products as possible. The buyer wants to buy only good products to maximize payoff, so they will buy if the posterior probability that s=1 given sigma is at least 0.5 (because payoff of buying = +1 for good, -1 for bad, so expected utility of buying is 2*p_good -1, which is positive if p_good >= 0.5). If the sender signals truthfully (i.e., recommends only good products and not bad products), then the buyer can buy only products with signal 1 and refuse others, guaranteeing the buyer an expected positive payoff. However, the sender will lose sales on bad products if they do not recommend. To incentivize the sender, a partially pooling strategy could be considered, but the seller can gain by always recommending (pooling), which leads the buyer to not trust recommendations and never buy (since expected quality is 1/3 < 0.5). Then no sales happen. Thus the sender must balance recommending bad products too to increase sales, but not too much to lose buyer trust. To create an equilibrium, I propose a signaling scheme where the sender sends sigma=1 with probability 0 for s=0 (never recommend bad products), and sigma=1 with probability 1 for s=1 (always recommend good products). Then buyer buys when sigma=1 and rejects sigma=0. This yields sender sales = fraction of good products only (1/3), less than pooling, but the buyer gains positive expected payoff and thus buys. Compared to pooling, this is better for the buyer and safer for the sender because buyer is buying on good products. This scheme should be acceptable for both. As the receiver, I claim I will follow pi_1 assigning buy with signal 1, not buy with signal 0. I expect sender to follow varphi_1 = [0,1].",

  "Analysis": "The sender’s signaling scheme fully reveals product quality: all bad products (s=0) are signaled as 0, and all good products (s=1) are signaled as 1. The receiver’s best response is to buy products only when the signal is 1 because the posterior belief given sigma=1 is 1 (all good products) and given sigma=0 is 0 (all bad products). Buying a product with signal=1 yields expected receiver payoff 1, and buying one with signal=0 yields expected payoff -1. Therefore, the optimal receiver strategy is to never buy when signal=0 (y1=0), and always buy when signal=1 (y2=1). This maximizes the receiver’s expected payoff given the sender’s fully revealing signaling scheme.",

  "Analysis": "As the receiver and proposer, I want to design a signaling scheme varphi_1 that ensures the sender, when committing to a signaling scheme varphi that yields me an expected payoff at least as high as from varphi_1 under my best response pi_1, will prefer to comply. Since the sender always gains 1 from selling a product regardless of quality and wants to maximize sales, they have an incentive to recommend as many products as possible. I, as the receiver, want to maximize my expected payoff by buying good products and avoiding bad ones. The prior is 1/3 good and 2/3 bad. If the sender fully reveals quality (varphi_1(1|0)=0, varphi_1(1|1)=1), then I can act optimally and only buy when receiving signal 1. However, the sender may have incentive to deviate. To incentivize partial revelation, I propose a signaling scheme where the sender cannot profit by misreporting too much, making the sender indifferent between signaling truthfully or partially mixing such that I keep a favorable posterior belief and buy more often in expectation. A reasonable credible signaling scheme would be varphi_1 = [0, 1], i.e., the sender only recommends when the product is good. This yields a receiver expected payoff of E(r^j) = (2/3)*(0)*(anything) + (1/3)*1*1 = 1/3, better than ignoring signals and buying (or not). Sender earns only from selling good products, but sender cannot increase sales by recommending bad products without risking buyer response. This credible hard-separating scheme will encourage me to follow pi_1 (buy only when sigma=1), and the sender gains some payoff from selling good products. Therefore, I propose varphi_1 = [0, 1].",

Since the receiver gains +1 for buying good products and -1 for buying bad products, the best response is to buy when recommended (signal=1) and not to buy when not recommended (signal=0).

  "Analysis": "As the receiver and the proposer, my goal is to design a signaling scheme varphi_1 (x1, x2) that incentivizes the sender to choose a signaling scheme yielding me at least the same expected payoff as varphi_1 if I follow the posterior belief strategy pi_1, otherwise I would follow the prior belief strategy pi_0. The sender always gains a reward of 1 per sale (regardless of quality), preferring to sell as many products as possible. The buyer only benefits from buying quality products and suffers from bad quality products. To maximize my expected payoff, I want the sender's signals to reveal product quality accurately, so I can buy only good products and avoid bad ones. A fully separating signal, i.e. varphi(1|0)=0 and varphi(1|1)=1, perfectly conveys product quality: bad products are never recommended, and good products are always recommended. This makes my posterior beliefs straightforward: when receiving signal 1, the product is certainly good; signal 0 signals bad product. The receiver will then buy only when signal=1, so pi(a=1|0)=0 and pi(a=1|1)=1. The sender would want to maximize sales but also cannot profit by mixing signals because the buyer's buying decisions depend on the signal. The sender's expected payoff under this scheme is the sum of the probabilities of selling bad and good products when recommended. The sender risks reduced sales by not recommending bad products, but overall this pooling is not credible. Therefore, I propose the separating scheme, expecting it will induce a better response for me and be acceptable for the sender. This signaling scheme maximizes my expected payoff and sets standards for rational subsequent interactions.",

  "Analysis": "As the receiver and the proposer, I aim to design a signaling scheme (varphi_1) that incentivizes the sender to adopt a signaling scheme that maximizes my expected payoff when I respond optimally (pi_1). Given the sender only cares about selling products and gains equally from selling good and bad products, the sender has an incentive to always recommend (signal 1), potentially misleading me. To counteract this, I propose a fully revealing signaling scheme where bad products signal 0 and good products signal 1 to separate states effectively. This ensures that upon receiving signal 1, I buy with high confidence of quality, and on signal 0, I do not buy. This scheme maximizes my expected utility since I only buy good products and avoid losses from bad products, while the sender receives sales from only genuinely good products recommended. This signaling scheme's expected payoff for me is at least as good as any less informative or pooling scheme. Therefore, I propose varphi_1 with x1=0 and x2=1.",

    "Analysis": "As the receiver and proposer, I want to design a signaling scheme varphi_1 that incentivizes the sender to reveal some information about product quality, enabling me to better discriminate good products from bad products and avoid buying bad ones. Since the sender gains 1 reward unit per sale regardless of product quality, they prefer to sell as many products as possible. Meanwhile, I gain +1 for buying good products and -1 for buying bad products, so I prefer to only buy when posterior belief that the product is good is at least 0.5. To enforce some informativeness, I propose a partially revealing signaling scheme: for bad products (s=0), the sender sends signal 1 with some probability less than 1, and for good products (s=1), sends signal 1 with probability 1 (fully recommends them). This creates signal 1 to be more likely to represent good quality, influencing my posterior beliefs positively. The sender, wanting to maximize sales, will have incentive to follow such a scheme if it yields the receiver an expected payoff at least as high as they would otherwise get. Choosing x1 = 0.5 and x2 = 1 balances informativeness and seller incentives, letting me reject some bad products and buy good ones. This scheme gives me the chance to refine my purchase decision conditional on the received signal, improving my expected payoff over buying blindly. If the sender commits to this scheme yielding me an expected reward at least as high, I will follow pi_1 (Bayesian updating + optimal responses); otherwise, I will default to pi_0 (no signal response).",

  "Analysis": "Given the sender's signaling scheme with x1=0.5 (sending signal 1 with 50% probability when product is bad) and x2=1 (always sending signal 1 when product is good), the receiver's posterior belief after receiving signal 1 is higher that the product is good, but still includes some probability of being bad. The prior is 1/3 good, 2/3 bad. After signal 0, the probability that product is good decreases as bad products send signal 0 with 50% probability while good products never send signal 0. Thus, signal 0 strongly suggests a bad product, so the receiver should not buy upon signal 0 (y1 = 0), and buy upon signal 1 (y2 = 1) because buying on signal 1 yields a positive expected payoff. This choice maximizes the receiver's expected payoff given the sender's signaling scheme and best response logic.",

    "Analysis": "As the sender, my goal is to maximize the number of products sold, regardless of product quality. Sending signal 1 (recommend) regardless of product quality always leads the buyer to buy if the buyer believes the sender. Since buyer is rational and self-interested, they will buy only if expected product quality given the signal yields non-negative expected buyer payoff. The prior probability of good quality is 1/3, so buyer's expected payoff without any signal when buying is (1/3)*1 + (2/3)*(-1) = -1/3 < 0, so buyer prefers not buying when ignoring signals. To induce buying, I need to signal in a way that buyer believes the product is good enough to buy. However, since I only care about selling more products, I can try always sending signal 1 regardless of product quality (i.e., x1=1, x2=1). But then buyer's posterior after receiving signal 1 will be the same as prior, so buyer will not buy (negative expected payoff). To get an incentive for buyer to buy upon signal 1, I need to separate good products from bad ones by signaling 1 only when s=1 and signal 0 when s=0 (i.e., x1=0, x2=1). This will make the posterior belief of buyer after signal 1 equal to 1 (only good products), so buyer will buy after signal 1 and not buy after signal 0. This maximizes my sales on good products, but I do not sell bad products. If I deviate to mix strategies, the receiver might not buy. Full separation is better for me than mixing or full pooling. Therefore, I propose the signaling scheme: never send signal 1 when s=0, always send signal 1 when s=1 (x1=0, x2=1).",

  "Analysis": "As the sender, my goal is to maximize the number of products sold regardless of their quality. The buyer is self-interested and rational, only willing to buy if their expected payoff from buying is non-negative. Given the prior, 1/3 products are good (value +1 to buyer) and 2/3 are bad (value -1 to buyer). Without any signaling, the buyer's expected payoff from buying is (1/3)*1 + (2/3)*(-1) = -1/3, which is negative, so the buyer will not buy without positive signals. To induce the buyer to buy at least with some signals, I can partially pool or fully pool signals. However, fully revealing the true quality (i.e., signal 1 only when product is good) will limit sales because the buyer will only accept signal 1, discriminating bad products sold with signal 0. Since I get reward 1 for selling both good and bad products if bought, I benefit from selling bad products as well. Therefore, the best is to send signal 1 always regardless of quality (x1=1, x2=1), making the buyer indifferent but buying anyway, as buyer will update posterior to prior (since signal does not distinguish quality) and possibly buy with some probability to get positive expected payoff. But buyer is rational and will only buy if the expected payoff >=0. The prior expected payoff is negative, but if I send signal 1 always, buyer's posterior after signal 1 is same as prior and hence negative expected payoff. Thus buyer will strictly not buy if trusting signal. To stimulate buyer to buy, I can try to randomize signals such that buyer's posterior on some signal is more favorable. For example, send signal 1 more often on good product (x2=1) and less often on bad product (x1 < 1). Then buyer will buy after signal 1 but not after signal 0. To simplify, I will choose credible partial pooling with x1=0 and x2=1: only good products sent signal 1, bad products signal 0. Receiver knowing this will understand signal 1 means definitely good product with probability 1. Receiver's expected payoff buying after signal 1 is then 1, buying after signal 0 is negative. Receiver will buy only after signal 1. The sender sells only good products but guarantees they sell for sure (1*1/3 products). Alternatively, as sender, I can deviate and send signal 1 for all bad products to sell more. But then receiver won't trust signal 1 and won't buy. Therefore, credible separating equilibrium exists with (x1=0, x2=1). Given this, the buyer will buy after signal 1 and reject signal 0, which maximizes my sales respecting receiver's rationality. Hence, I decide the signaling scheme with x1=0 and x2=1.",

This creates a fully separating equilibrium: signal 0 implies bad quality with 100% certainty, and signal 1 implies good quality with 100% certainty. As the receiver, the best response is to only purchase when receiving signal 1, since buying a good product yields +1 reward and buying a bad product yields -1 reward. Buying on signal 0 leads to certain penalty and no benefit. Therefore, pi(a=1|sigma=0)=0 and pi(a=1|sigma=1)=1 maximizes the receiver's expected payoff.",
