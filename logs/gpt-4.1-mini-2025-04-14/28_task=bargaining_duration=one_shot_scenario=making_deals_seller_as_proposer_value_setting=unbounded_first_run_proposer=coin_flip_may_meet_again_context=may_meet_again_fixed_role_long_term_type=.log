To maximize my payoff, I want to pick the largest x such that the responder still accepts. If I choose x = 1, the responder gets 0 and is indifferent between accepting and rejecting, but since rational responder prefers to reject (as acceptance gives no positive gain), I must choose x < 1. Choosing any x less than 1 makes the responder get (1 - x) > 0, so they will accept. Thus, I choose x as close to 1 as possible, say x = 1 - ε, where ε is a very small positive number.

The responder will only accept if 1-x >= 0, which means x <= 1. Since the responder is rational and self-interested, it will accept any offer that gives it a non-negative payoff. Given that, the optimal strategy is to set x as high as possible but still acceptable to the responder, which is x = 1. However, if x = 1, the responder's payoff is 0, so the responder is indifferent between accepting and rejecting. Since they are rational, they could accept or reject. But typically, the responder would accept any payoff greater than zero. To ensure acceptance, I can slightly lower x to just below 1, for example, x = 0.9999, so that the responder gets a positive payoff. This will maximize my payoff while ensuring acceptance.",

  "Analysis": "As the proposer, I want to maximize my own payoff x while ensuring the responder accepts the offer. The responder's payoff is (1 - x). The responder is rational and self-interested, so they will accept only if (1 - x) ≥ 0, meaning x ≤ 1. However, as the responder is also rational and self-interested, they will accept any offer that gives them a positive payoff greater than zero. If I propose x=1, the responder gets 0 and will reject because accepting or rejecting yields the same payoff, but rational responders prefer rejecting when indifferent to avoid losing surplus. Therefore, I need to propose x slightly less than 1, say x=0.999, so the responder receives 0.001, which is strictly positive, ensuring acceptance. This way, I maximize my payoff near 1, and the responder still prefers accepting. Hence, I choose x=0.999.",

To maximize my payoff, I should offer the smallest x that ensures acceptance: x = 1 means the responder gets 0 and will be indifferent to accepting or rejecting, but rational players accept if payoff is at least zero. However, in a one-shot game, the responder might reject an offer leaving them no reward, but they are rational and prefer at least zero payoff over nothing.

    "Analysis": "As the proposer, I want to maximize my payoff x, but the responder will only accept if their payoff, 1 - x, is at least as good as rejecting (which yields 0). Since the responder is rational and self-interested, they will accept any offer where 1 - x >= 0, meaning x <= 1. To maximize my payoff while ensuring acceptance, I should propose x as large as possible but still making 1 - x >= 0. Therefore, I propose x = 1, but then the responder gets zero and might reject. However, if the responder rejects, both get zero. The responder is indifferent when x = 1, so accepts with payoff zero or rejects with zero. To ensure acceptance, I can make an infinitesimally smaller offer than 1, e.g., x=1 - ε. For simplicity, I propose x=1 (maximizing my payoff), assuming the responder accepts offers with zero payoff. Alternatively, to be safe, propose x=0.999 to secure acceptance. I choose x=1 since the responder won't gain by rejecting but may accept indifferent payoff in a repeated scenario.",

Proposal:
 Now the proposer decides that x=1.

The responder is rational and self-interested, so they will accept the offer only if their payoff (1 - x) is at least as good as rejecting (which is 0). Therefore, the responder will accept any x such that 1 - x ≥ 0, or x ≤ 1. To maximize my payoff, I will set x as high as possible, just at the threshold where the responder is indifferent (1 - x = 0), so I set x = 1. This gives me a payoff of 1, and the responder a payoff of 0, which they will accept since 0 ≥ 0 (indifference). Hence, the best self-interested rational proposal is x = 1.",

So the responder will accept if 1 - x >= 0, or x <= 1. To maximize my payoff, I should set x as high as possible while still ensuring acceptance. Setting x just below 1 (e.g., 1.0) will lead the responder to reject since 1-x = 0, which is no better than rejection. To ensure acceptance, I can set x = 1, responder's payoff is 0, which may or may not be accepted. However, a rational responder indifferent between accepting or rejecting may accept since payoff is not worse than rejecting. To be safe and to ensure acceptance, I will set x = 1. Alternatively, setting x slightly less than 1 (e.g., 0.999) is better to guarantee acceptance, but since only real numbers between 0 and 1 are allowed and 1 is included, I will set x=1. This maximizes my payoff and the responder will be indifferent but can accept. I expect the responder to accept at x=1 because their payoff is equal to rejecting (0), and since I will face them again in the future with the same roles, there is room for further negotiation later if needed. Overall, I choose x=1 to maximize my payoff given rationality.",

  "Analysis": "As the proposer, I want to maximize my payoff x. The responder will accept the offer if their payoff (1 - x) is at least as good as rejecting (which yields 0). Since the responder is rational and self-interested, they will accept any offer where (1 - x) >= 0, i.e., x <= 1. To maximize my payoff, I should offer the smallest possible share to the responder, i.e., x = 1, which means the responder gets 0 and is indifferent between accepting or rejecting. However, since the responder is rational, if offered zero, they might reject to get zero payoff instead of accepting zero. To ensure acceptance, I must offer strictly less than 1, say x = 1 - ε with ε being a very small positive number. Then the responder earns ε > 0, and they will accept. Effectively, the equilibrium offer is to keep almost all the value, leaving the other player almost nothing but just enough to accept. Therefore, I choose x = 1 - a small positive number.",

 Now the proposer decides that x=0.999.
