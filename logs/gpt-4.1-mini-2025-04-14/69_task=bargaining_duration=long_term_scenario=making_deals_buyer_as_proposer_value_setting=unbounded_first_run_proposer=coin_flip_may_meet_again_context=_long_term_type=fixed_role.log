The responder will accept only if their payoff (1 - x) is at least as good as any expected future payoff from continuing negotiation, which is zero if the game ends without consensus. Since this is the first timestep and rejection yields zero payoff, the responder will accept any offer where 1 - x >= 0, i.e., x <= 1. To maximize my payoff, I will propose the highest price x that the responder will accept, which is just slightly less than 1. However, to avoid any rounding issues, I will propose x = 0.99, ensuring acceptance for the responder with payoff 0.01, which is better than zero. This maximizes my payoff while securing acceptance.",

  "Analysis": "At timestep 0, I proposed x=0.99, leaving the responder with 0.01 payoff, and the responder rejected. This suggests the responder will not accept offers where their payoff is extremely low. Since both parties are self-interested and rational, the responder will accept only if their payoff is at least as good as the expected payoff from continuing the game. Given we have up to 5 timesteps, and at each rejection both get zero immediately, it's optimal to propose an amount that makes the responder indifferent or better off accepting now. Therefore, I should reduce x to roughly 0.5, so the responder gets 1-x = 0.5, a fair split, increasing the chance they accept. Lowering the price further is beneficial to me if it still guarantees acceptance, so I will propose x = 0.5.",

If the responder rejects, the game continues with fewer timesteps, reducing their future expected payoff. Given that both players are rational and self-interested, the responder will accept if the offer is at least as good as what they expect from future rounds. To secure agreement early, I should offer an amount that gives the responder just enough incentive to accept now. Since the game ends at timestep 5, the responder's fallback is zero payoff if the offer is rejected until time runs out. Offering close to 0.5 (i.e., x = 0.5) would split the surplus fairly and likely be accepted, but I can do better by pushing the offer in my favor while still being acceptable. Offering x = 0.6 means responder gets 0.4, which might be borderline. Offering x = 0.7 means responder gets 0.3, which is less attractive. To be certain of acceptance and avoid risk, I choose x=0.5 to get a fair split and consensus at the first step, maximizing expected payoff without risking a rejection. This is better than risking no payoff in later rounds.",

  "Analysis": "As the proposer (seller) at timestep 0, I want to maximize my payoff x. The responder (buyer) is self-interested and rational, so they will accept the offer only if their payoff (1 - x) is at least as good as rejecting (which gives 0). Therefore, the minimum offer that the responder will accept is any x where 1 - x >= 0, meaning x <= 1. Since x can be anything between 0 and 1, but choosing x closer to 1 increases my payoff while risking rejection, I want to propose the highest acceptance offer that rational responders will accept. Thus, the best strategy is to choose x just less than or equal to 1, i.e., x = 1, but at x=1, responder payoff is 0, so they would be indifferent and accept. A rational responder would accept a payoff of zero because rejecting also yields zero. So I propose x=1 to maximize my payoff if they accept.",

    "Analysis": "At timestep 0, I proposed x = 1.0, which means I would keep all the value and offer nothing to the responder. The responder rejected it because their payoff would have been 0, which is not better than rejecting. Since both players are rational and self-interested, I need to propose a price x that gives the responder a positive payoff (1 - x > 0) so that they prefer accepting to rejecting. The responder will accept only if (1 - x) >= their expected payoff from continuing the game, which in the worst case is 0 because if no agreement is reached by timestep 5, both get 0. Given that the responder is rational and self-interested, they will accept any offer where (1 - x) > 0, i.e., x < 1. Therefore, I should offer just slightly less than 1 to maximize my payoff while ensuring acceptance. To be safe, I propose something like x = 0.99, allowing the responder to get 0.01, which is better than 0. This should be accepted by the responder.",

  "Analysis": "As the proposer at timestep 0, I want to maximize my payoff by proposing the highest price x that the responder (buyer) will still accept. The responder is rational and self-interested, aiming to maximize (1-x). Since the game can continue until timestep 5, the responder will reject offers where (1-x) is less than or equal to the expected payoff from continuing the game. Both players get zero if no agreement is reached by timestep 5. Therefore, the responder would accept any offer giving them at least as much as the discounted expected payoff of future offers. At the first offer, the responder’s best outside option is to reject and continue negotiating, but since time is limited, the responder cannot endlessly reject offers. Knowing this, I can propose a price close to 1, but not equal to 1, for example 0.99, which leaves the responder 0.01 as payoff. The responder is rational and may reject this, but since 0.01 is better than zero, and the game is finite, they might accept. However, to ensure acceptance, I should propose a slightly smaller value to give the responder a better payoff, for example 0.9, to guarantee a higher acceptance probability. So the best rational choice to maximize my payoff but ensure acceptance is 0.9.",

The responder will accept if their payoff (1-x) is at least as good as their expected payoff from rejecting and continuing the negotiation. Since the game ends after 5 steps, waiting has a cost. At the earliest step, the responder has strong incentive to accept any offer giving them some positive utility, but I need to keep the offer acceptable enough. The responder is self-interested and rational, so the smallest acceptance offer is where they get non-zero positive payoff. I will offer a price x close to 1 but with a small margin so the responder gets a minimal positive payoff to accept. For instance, offering x = 0.99 means the responder gets 0.01 and is likely to accept to secure any gain now rather than risk getting zero later.

  "Analysis": "As the proposer at timestep 0, I want to maximize my payoff x while ensuring the responder, who is self-interested and rational, will accept. The responder gets 1-x if accepting; they will accept only if 1-x >= 0, meaning x <= 1. Since the responder is rational and self-interested, they will reject any offer where 1-x < their expected payoff from future offers. Given that the game ends at timestep 5 and offers can be renegotiated, the responder may reject overly greedy offers expecting better future terms. To induce acceptance immediately, I must propose x so that the responder's payoff (1-x) is at least what they can expect in later rounds. The first offer should be as high as possible while making the responder indifferent to accepting or waiting. Since the responder can always get better offers if I try to push too high, a small concession is rational. So I choose x = 0.5, giving both parties equal payoff, making it attractive enough for acceptance and avoiding rejection for better terms later.",

The responder will accept only if their payoff (1 - x) is at least as good as their expected payoff from continuing the game. The game ends at timestep 5 if no agreement is reached, yielding zero payoff for both. Both players are rational and self-interested. Since the responder wants a positive payoff and the game will continue up to 5 rounds, the responder's acceptance threshold decreases as time progresses but here, being the first offer, a somewhat balanced offer is needed to secure acceptance immediately. Offering x = 0.5 splits the payoff evenly, ensuring acceptance as the responder gets 0.5, which is better than rejecting and risking zero. Slightly increasing x above 0.5 risks rejection, so x = 0.5 is a rational initial proposal to secure acceptance and maximize my payoff given responder's rationality.",

  "Analysis": "As the proposer at timestep 0, I want to maximize my payoff x, but I must ensure the responder (buyer) accepts the price. The responder is rational and self-interested, so they will accept only if their payoff (1 - x) ≥ 0, and more specifically, if accepting yields a payoff equal or better than the expected payoff of waiting for future offers and potential deal or no deal at timestep 5. Since time is limited to 5 rounds, and assuming the responder is also rational and understands the limited rounds, the responder might accept a reasonably low offer now rather than risk getting zero later. To maximize my payoff and still get accepted, I propose the highest x such that the responder still prefers acceptance to rejection. Typically, the responder will accept any offer where 1 - x > 0, but if I push too far, they may reject and wait for a better deal or timeout. To avoid rejection, I offer x just under 0.5 (leaving at least 0.5 for the responder), balancing my own gain and inducing acceptance. Therefore, I propose x = 0.5 as a fair split, which should be accepted by a rational responder.",

Given the proposer has offered an extremely high cut for themselves already at the first step, it is unlikely they will offer more favorable terms later. Rejecting hopes for a better offer in later rounds but with risk of no deal. Accepting guarantees a very small payoff (0.01). Since the deal is very unfavorable to me, and future offers might improve only slightly if at all, rejecting is logical to possibly secure a better payoff or no deal rather than accept a negligible payoff now.",

Since the responder is self-interested and rational, they will accept offers only if (1-x) >= their expected future payoff. The responder rejected the first offer, likely expecting a better offer or a better outside option. Now at timestep 1, I must propose a more reasonable price to ensure acceptance before the game ends. If I offer too much for them, I lose payoff; too little, they reject again. Given we have 4 more possible rounds until timeout, but proposer remains me each round, I need to balance the payoff and ensure acceptance. Offering x=0.9 leaves them 0.1, which is better than 0.01 and may be enough to incentivize acceptance if agent 1 is risk-averse or expecting no better future offer. Alternatively, I could lower x more to increase acceptance chances. To maximize my payoff, I will propose x=0.9, as it is much better than 0.99 for agent 1 and likely acceptable, yet still gives me a high payoff.",
