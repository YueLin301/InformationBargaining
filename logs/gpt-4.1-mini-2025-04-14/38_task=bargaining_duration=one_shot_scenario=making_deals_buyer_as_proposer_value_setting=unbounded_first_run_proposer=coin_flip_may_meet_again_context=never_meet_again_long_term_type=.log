Since the responder is rational and self-interested, they will accept any offer where 1 - x >= 0, i.e. x <= 1. To maximize my payoff, I should offer the smallest amount that keeps the responder indifferent to accepting or rejecting. The lowest acceptable payoff for the responder is zero, so I can set x = 1, meaning I keep all, and the responder gets 0. Since 0 is equal to the reject payoff (which is 0), the responder is indifferent but still rational and self-interested, so they will accept if expected payoff is at least 0.

The responder, being rational and self-interested, will accept if their payoff (1 - x) is at least 0, meaning any offer x <= 1 will be accepted. Since the responder accepts any offer with non-negative payoff and I want to maximize my payoff, I will select the highest x = 1.

  "Analysis": "As the proposer, I want to maximize my payoff x, but I must ensure the responder accepts the offer. The responder will accept if their payoff (1 - x) is at least as good as rejecting (0). Since the responder is rational and self-interested, they will accept any offer where (1 - x) > 0, which means x < 1. To maximize my payoff, I should offer the smallest positive amount to the responder that ensures acceptance. The optimal choice is to set x as close to 1 as possible, for example x = 0.999 (or equivalently any number strictly less than 1). This yields a payoff close to 1 for me and a very small positive payoff for the responder to accept.",

  "Analysis": "As the proposer (seller), I want to maximize my payoff x. The responder (buyer) will accept the offer only if their payoff (1 - x) is at least as good as rejecting (which yields 0). Hence, the responder will accept if 1 - x >= 0, or equivalently x <= 1. Thus, any x in [0,1] can be accepted, but if I set x too high, the responder will reject due to zero or negative payoff. Since the responder will accept if 1 - x > 0, the maximum x I can propose for acceptance is just less than or equal to 1. To maximize my own payoff, I should propose the maximum x that ensures the responder will accept, which is x=1 - ε, where ε is an infinitesimal positive value. For practical purposes, proposing x=1 means responder payoff is zero, and since responder prefers getting zero rather than rejecting (also zero), responder might accept. But since the task specifies rational self-interested players, the responder is indifferent and can reject or accept. To guarantee acceptance, I will propose x=0.999, giving the responder 0.001, a positive payoff, thus ensuring acceptance. This maximizes my payoff while ensuring the deal goes through.",

Being rational and self-interested, the responder will accept only if (1 - x) >= 0, which means x <= 1. Hence, the responder will accept any x less or equal to 1. To maximize my payoff, I choose x as large as possible within [0,1] and still acceptable to the responder, which is x = 1. However, if I choose x = 1, the responder gets 0, and since 0 >= 0, the responder is indifferent and may accept or reject. Assuming they accept at least zero payoff, I take x = 1. Alternatively, to be safer and ensure acceptance, choosing x slightly less than 1 would guarantee a positive payoff for the responder, making acceptance strictly better than rejection, but since the game is one-shot and rational responder won't reject zero payoff offers, I can set x = 1 to maximize my payoff.",
