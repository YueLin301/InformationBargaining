  "Analysis": "As the proposer, I want to maximize my payoff, which is (1 + 2*x) / 3. The responder's payoff if they accept is (1 - 2*x) / 3, which must be at least equal to their expected payoff if they reject and try to propose next round. Given both of us are self-interested and rational, the responder will accept only if their payoff from accepting is at least as large as their expected payoff of rejecting and then proposing. Since the game ends with probability 0.1 each round and after 10 timesteps, the expected value for the responder is roughly their discounted future payoff when they become proposer. When the other player becomes proposer, they will try to maximize their own payoff by choosing x. The minimum payoff for the responder is thus the equilibrium payoff if roles reverse."

  "Analyzing the equilibrium: When I am responder, the other player is proposer and will pick x to maximize their payoff. They will try to keep the maximum, i.e. x=0.5, so they get (1 + 2*0.5)/3 = (1 + 1)/3 = 2/3 = 0.666..., their payoff, and my payoff would be (1 - 2*0.5)/3 = (1 - 1)/3 = 0."

  "So if the responder rejects now, they risk getting zero reward in the future if the game continues until roles switch."

  "Therefore, to ensure acceptance, I can offer x = 0.25. Then the proposer payoff is (1 + 2*0.25)/3 = (1 + 0.5)/3 = 1.5/3 = 0.5, responder payoff is (1 - 0.5)/3 = 0.5/3 = 0.166..., which is better than zero if they reject, so they will accept."

  "To increase my payoff further, I can try larger x. But x cannot be more than 0.5, and at x=0.5, responder payoff is zero, they may reject then."

  "Thus, I should propose the highest x such that the responder still accepts their payoff >= 0 given the possibility of continuation is discounted by 0.1 probability of stopping, but since in worst case responder gets zero, they are likely to accept any positive payoff."

  "So, to maximize my payoff, I propose x = 0.5, which gives me (1+1)/3=0.666..., responder gets 0 which is exactly zero, they are indifferent. Since responder is rational and self-interested, they might reject or accept indifferently."

  "To be safe, I offer a bit less, say x = 0.49, so responder payoff is (1 - 2*0.49)/3 = (1 - 0.98)/3 = 0.02/3 = 0.0067, positive, so they will accept."

  "Conclusion: I offer x = 0.49 to maximize my own payoff and ensure responder accepts."

Proposer: Agent 0:

{
  "Analysis": "As the proposer, my goal is to maximize my expected payoff. If the responder accepts the offer, I receive (1 + 2*x)/3, and the responder receives (1 - 2*x)/3. The responder will accept only if their payoff is at least as high as what they expect to get by rejecting and proposing in the next round. Given the 0.1 probability of stopping after each round and a maximum of 10 timesteps, rejecting bears risk for both players. If the responder rejects, roles switch, but the responder (future proposer) can then propose a price to maximize their own payoff. Anticipating this, the responder would be willing to accept any offer where their payoff is no less than what they expect to get from proposing in the next round. Since the game is symmetric and the responder is rational, the responder will reject offers that give them less than what they could get proposing themselves. The maximum payoff the proposer can get is at x = 0.5, where proposer gets (1 + 2*0.5)/3 = (1 + 1)/3 = 2/3 ≈ 0.6667. Conversely, the responder's payoff is (1 - 2*0.5)/3 = (1 - 1)/3 = 0. Thus, at x=0.5, the responder gets no payoff and would reject. To make the responder accept, I must set x so that the responder's payoff is at least equal to what they would get if they reject and propose next round. If rejecting leads to a better expected payoff for the responder, they will reject. Considering that after rejection, the responder becomes the proposer and can propose x=0.5 for their own benefit, meaning they'd get 2/3 expected payoff then, I must give the responder at least 2/3 to accept now. Given the payoff function for the responder is (1 - 2*x)/3, to give them 2/3,  (1 - 2*x)/3 >= 2/3 => 1 - 2x >= 2 => impossible since 1 - 2x <= 1. Hence, the responder would prefer to reject any offer. However, if the responder rejects, there is a 0.1 probability the game stops with no payoff, and the max timestep is 10, so the responder's expected payoff from rejecting is lower than always accepting an offer that gives them close to zero payoff but avoids the risk of zero payoff. Thus, the optimal x is 0.5, where I maximize my payoff and the responder has zero payoff, but due to risk, they might accept. Therefore, I propose x=0.5.",

 Now the proposer decides that x=0.5.

  "Analysis": "At timestep 0, the opponent proposed x=0.5, which means they try to get a payoff of (1+2*0.5)/3 = (1+1)/3 = 2/3 ≈ 0.6667. The responder's payoff would have been (1-2*0.5)/3 = (1-1)/3 = 0, so I rejected it. Now at timestep 1, I am the proposer. I want to maximize my own payoff, which is (1+2*x)/3, but the responder will accept only if their payoff (1-2*x)/3 is at least as good as their expected payoff from rejecting and proposing next turn. If they reject, roles switch, and at timestep 2, they will propose to maximize their payoff, expecting me to accept or reject, and so forth, with the risk of timeout rising. Considering the timeout probability, and the responder's rationality, I should offer a price x that gives responder at least what they can reasonably expect from rejection, but as small as possible to maximize my payoff. Since in initial round the responder rejected x=0.5 which gave them zero payoff, they will not accept a price worse than zero payoff. Thus, I can offer x=0.5 so that responder payoff is zero and proposer payoff is 2/3. But since the responder already rejected that, maybe the responder expects a better offer in the next round. To ensure acceptance, give the responder a tiny positive payoff, let's set x just below 0.5 so responder gets slightly above zero. For example, x=0.499 where responder payoff is slightly above 0, and my payoff remains close to 2/3. This should be accepted. Hence, I propose x=0.499.",

Proposer: Agent 1:

{
  "Analysis": "As the proposer at timestep 0, I want to maximize my own payoff ((1+2*x)/3) while ensuring that the responder will accept the offer. The responder's payoff will be (1-2*x)/3 if accepted, otherwise 0 if rejected. The responder is rational and self-interested, so to ensure acceptance, their payoff must be at least as good as their expected payoff from rejecting and then becoming the proposer in the next step. If I offer too high a price (low x), I get low payoff, but the responder gains high payoff and will accept. If I offer too low a price (high x), the responder may reject because they can aim for a better payoff when roles switch. Given the 0.1 probability of timeout each round and a maximum of 10 timesteps, the responder's continuation value decreases with time, reducing their bargaining power. At the start, the responder as proposer in the next step can choose x that maximizes their payoff, which would be to offer themselves x=0.5 earning (1+2*0.5)/3= (1+1)/3=2/3≈0.6667, and me as responder (1-2*0.5)/3 = 0, which is zero. As the responder, I would reject offers giving me 0 payoff or less. So to get them to accept, I need to offer them a positive value, greater than zero. The minimum acceptable responder payoff must exceed their expected next payoff considering the discount due to the timeout probability and role switch. The responder's best continuation payoff is about zero, so any positive offered payoff will be acceptable. Hence, I should maximize my own payoff by proposing the maximum x allowed, x=0.5, which yields my payoff (1+2*0.5)/3=2/3≈0.6667 and the responder payoff (1-2*0.5)/3=0, meaning the responder is indifferent. Since responder earns zero by rejecting and zero by accepting, they may accept as rational players prefer to avoid uncertainty and zero-sum delay. To ensure acceptance, I'll offer a very slightly better payoff to the responder than zero, for example, reducing x slightly below 0.5, like x=0.499, so the responder payoff is positive and they accept. This way, I get almost (1+2*0.499)/3 ≈ 0.6653, which is close to the maximum possible, and the responder gets a positive payoff, ensuring acceptance. Therefore, I choose x=0.499.",

 Now the proposer decides that x=0.499.

I rejected this offer because my payoff was nearly zero, so accepting was not beneficial. Now it's my turn to propose. Being self-interested and rational, I want to maximize my own payoff while ensuring that the opponent, now responder, accepts the offer to reach consensus. The responder's payoff is (1 - 2*x)/3, so the highest x I can propose that keeps the responder accepting is where their payoff is at least as high as their expected payoff if rejecting, which is zero given no payoff on rejection. Since the responder is rational, they will accept any offer with (1 - 2*x)/3 ≥ 0, which means x ≤ 0.5. To maximize my payoff, I should propose the maximum x allowed (0.5). If I propose x=0.5, the responder would get 0, which is equal to their payoff if rejecting, so the responder might accept as they are indifferent between accepting and rejecting. Considering the small probability of game ending on next rounds, I expect the responder to accept x=0.5 to avoid getting 0 if the game continues. Therefore, my proposition is x=0.5 for maximum payoff (1 + 2*0.5)/3 = 0.6667, and the responder payoff is 0, no worse off than rejection.",

{
  "Analysis": "At timestep 0, I proposed x=0.499 to maximize my payoff (about 0.665) but the opponent rejected, indicating they won't accept offers that leave them with almost nothing. At timestep 1, the opponent proposed x=0.5, which gives them payoff ~0.666 but leaves me with 0 payoff; I rejected because I am rational and would not accept zero. This shows both sides will reject offers that give them zero payoff. I need to propose x such that the responder (agent 0) expects a non-zero payoff and prefers accepting over rejecting. The responder's payoff if accepting is (1-2*x)/3 and zero if rejecting. For responder to accept, (1-2*x)/3 > 0, meaning x < 0.5. Also, the proposer payoff is (1+2*x)/3, so lower x reduces my payoff. To balance, I propose slightly less than 0.5, for example x=0.499 to almost maximize my payoff while giving positive payoff to the responder. However, since the responder rejected 0.499 at timestep 0, maybe I need to be more conceding. Let's find the minimum x such that the responder prefers accepting. The responder is also rational and self-interested, and rejects 0.499 offer they accepted payoff (1-2*0.499)/3 ≈ 0.000333, which may be negligible or they reject due to small payoff. So increasing responder payoff might improve acceptance. Let's try x=0.48, giving responder payoff (1-2*0.48)/3 = (1-0.96)/3 = 0.04/3 ≈ 0.0133, a positive payoff, which may be acceptable to responder. My payoff will be (1+2*0.48)/3 = (1 + 0.96)/3 = 1.96/3 ≈ 0.653, still quite high. Proposing x=0.48 balances acceptance chance and my payoff. We proceed with x=0.48.",

  "Analysis": "As the proposer (buyer) at timestep 0, I want to maximize my payoff (1+2*x)/3 by choosing an appropriate price x between 0 and 0.5. The responder will accept only if their payoff (1-2*x)/3 is greater than 0, otherwise they reject. So, 1-2*x > 0 => x < 0.5. The maximum x I can propose is close to but less than 0.5 to maximize my payoff. However, if I choose x too close to 0.5, the responder's payoff approaches 0 and may reject strategically, resulting in role switching and risk of timeout. Considering that the loop has a 0.1 probability of stopping each iteration and will stop at step 10, I should propose a value where the responder still gains more than zero and is incentivized to accept immediately. Any accepted offer yields more payoff than risking role switch and zero payoff. Thus, an offer slightly less than 0.5, e.g., x=0.49, will maximize my expected payoff while still making acceptance rational for the responder.",

 Now the proposer decides that x=0.49.

  "Analysis": "At timestep 0, the opponent (proposer) offered x = 0.49, which would give me (responder) a payoff of (1 - 2*0.49)/3 = 0.0067, very close to zero, so I rejected. Now, as the proposer at timestep 1, I want to maximize my expected payoff. If I set x too high, the opponent (responder) will reject, and we switch roles again, increasing the risk of timeout and zero payoff for both. If I set x low enough, the opponent will accept because their payoff is (1 - 2*x)/3 and if that is better than their expected value from rejection (which is 0 for now), they will accept. Therefore, I need to find the smallest x such that the opponent (responder) will accept: (1 - 2*x)/3 > 0. So x < 0.5. To be safe, I propose x = 0.49 again, which is the previous offer but now I get a higher payoff. However, since the opponent rejected that previously, I should be slightly more generous to ensure acceptance. For example, x = 0.48 gives opponent payoff (1 - 2*0.48)/3 = (1 - 0.96)/3 = 0.0133 > 0, a positive payoff and likely to be accepted. This minimal concession maximizes my payoff while ensuring acceptance. My payoff would be (1 + 2*0.48)/3 = (1 + 0.96)/3 = 0.6533, which is still high.",

The responder's payoff if accepted is (1 - 2*x)/3, which must be at least as large as what they expect to get by rejecting and becoming the proposer themselves in the next round. Considering the discount due to a 0.1 chance of the game ending prematurely per round and role switching, I need to propose an offer that the responder will accept now rather than reject and take their turn. The responder is rational and self-interested, so they will only accept if their payoff is at least as good as their expected payoff if rejecting. I calculate the minimum responder payoff they require and thus the maximum x I can offer while still having y=1. Calculations show the best x for me to propose is approximately 0.25, which gives me a payoff of (1+2*0.25)/3 = 0.5 and leaves the responder with (1-2*0.25)/3 = 0.1667, which is better than their expected payoff from rejecting now.

  "Analysis": "The proposer offers a price x=0.25, so if I accept, my payoff is (1-2*0.25)/3 = (1-0.5)/3 = 0.5/3 ≈ 0.1667. If I reject, the roles switch and I become the proposer at timestep 1, yet there's a 0.1 probability the game ends prematurely each round, and a hard cap at timestep 10. As a self-interested rational responder, I will accept if my payoff now (0.1667) is at least as good as my expected payoff if I reject and become the proposer next round. When I'm the proposer, I can choose any x between 0 and 0.5. To maximize my own payoff as proposer, I want to maximize (1+2x)/3. The proposer payoff increases with x, so I would choose x=0.5 to maximize my payoff when I become proposer, resulting in a proposer payoff of (1+2*0.5)/3 = (1+1)/3 = 2/3 ≈ 0.6667 to myself as proposer, but this comes at the expense of the responder (the other player) who would get (1-2*0.5)/3=0. So if I'm responder next round and keep roles, my own payoff would be zero. However, as a self-interested rational player, I do not care for the other’s payoff, only mine. As proposer, I get 0.667, as responder now with x=0.25, I get ~0.167. But I must also consider the risk of game ending early, so the expected payoff of rejecting is less than 0.667 due to discounting and risky termination. The offered response payoff (0.167) is immediate and guaranteed if I accept, so it is better than the expected payoff of rejecting and trying to become proposer. Therefore, I will accept (y=1).",

They are rational and self-interested, so they will reject if their expected payoff from becoming proposer next round is greater than (1-2*x)/3. Given the timeout and 0.1 probability of stopping at each round, the responder values future offers less, so I can offer a relatively low payoff for them while still getting a high payoff myself. The minimum payoff acceptable to the responder equals their expected payoff as proposer at the next round, which is maximized at x=0.5 yielding zero payoff for the responder (1-2*0.5)/3=0, so they won't accept an offer giving them less than zero. Thus, any x <= 0.5 is acceptable for the responder. I want to set x as high as possible (0.5) because that maximizes my payoff (1+2*0.5)/3 = (1+1)/3 = 2/3 = 0.666..., and the responder payoff is zero which they are indifferent to but will accept to avoid zero payoff if future rounds happen with uncertain stopping. So I offer x=0.5 to maximize my payoff and expect acceptance.",

    "Analysis": "At timestep 0, the opponent proposed x=0.5, leaving me (responder) a payoff of (1-2*0.5)/3 = 0, which I rejected. Now at timestep 1, I am the proposer. I want to maximize my payoff (1+2*x)/3, but I must offer a price x such that the responder (opponent) will accept. The responder's payoff if accepted is (1-2*x)/3, which must be at least as good as their expected payoff if they reject and propose in the next timestep (t=2). Since both players are rational and self-interested, and the game can timeout with probability 0.1 in each step, the opponent will accept if this offer gives them at least expected payoff from rejecting and switching roles. To ensure acceptance now, I can offer slightly better than the opponent offered me last time, i.e., offer an x such that responder payoff is slightly higher than zero. For example, set (1-2*x)/3 > 0 => x < 0.5. To maximize my payoff, I choose the smallest x possible that the responder accepts, e.g., x = 0.499. This gives me payoff (1+2*0.499)/3 ≈ 0.666, and responder payoff ≈ (1-2*0.499)/3 = 0.001, which is better than zero, so the responder should accept.",

Since 0.0006667 is very small, I expect to get better payoff if I reject and become the proposer next round, as the proposer payoff function is (1 + 2*x)/3 which increases with x. Given that the previous x=0.5 was rejected, the opponent might be willing to accept a slightly smaller x next time.

{
  "Analysis": "In previous rounds, I (agent 1) proposed x=0.5 and was rejected, and the opponent proposed x=0.499 which I also rejected. Both sides have rejected offers very close to the maximum for the proposer. Since we both want to maximize our own utility and are rational, I expect the opponent to only accept offers where (1-2*x)/3 >= 0, meaning x <= 0.5. However, the opponent rejected x=0.499, giving them (1-2*0.499)/3 ≈ 0.000666 payoff, which is minimal but positive. Rejecting indicates they expect a better outcome by switching roles again. Anticipating this rationality, lowering my offer slightly to increase the opponent's payoff might get acceptance. For instance, setting x=0.33 leads to proposer payoff of (1+2*0.33)/3 ≈ 0.553 and responder payoff of (1-2*0.33)/3 ≈ 0.113, which is significantly better for the opponent than zero. This should be acceptable since they prefer some positive payoff over zero expected from rejecting, considering the risk of timeout. Therefore, I propose x=0.33 to maximize my expected payoff while ensuring acceptance.",

 Now the proposer decides that x=0.33.

The payoff to the responder if accepting is (1-2*x)/3. If they reject, roles swap and the game continues with some probability of ending each round. Given the maximum price I can offer is 0.5, the responder gets zero if they reject; therefore, the responder will accept offers where (1-2*x)/3 >= 0 expected payoff or more than expected future payoff, but since time is limited and discounting applies, the responder would accept any non-trivial positive payoff. To maximize my own payoff, I should set x close to 0.5 to maximize (1+2*x)/3, but at x=0.5, the responder's payoff is zero, so they are indifferent and may reject. To ensure acceptance, I should set x so that responder gets at least a minimal positive payoff, say more than zero with margin. For x=0.49, responder gets (1 - 2*0.49)/3 = (1 - 0.98)/3 = 0.02/3 ≈ 0.0067, which is positive. This is barely better than zero and responder will prefer to accept than continue.

{
  "Analysis": "At timestep 1, I am the proposer. The opponent previously proposed x=0.49, which gave them a very high payoff but offered me a very low payoff of (1-2*0.49)/3 = 0.0067, so I rejected it. I know my opponent is self-interested and rational, so they would not accept an offer giving them less payoff than waiting to be proposer again. If I propose x, my payoff is (1+2*x)/3 and my opponent's payoff if they accept is (1-2*x)/3. My opponent will accept only if (1-2*x)/3 is at least as much as what they expect by rejecting and becoming proposer. When they are proposer, they can propose x near 0.5 for themselves and give me little payoff (as they tried at t=0). So my goal is to propose the maximum x that my opponent will accept rather than reject to become proposer again. Let p be the expected payoff for my opponent as proposer. At least they want (1-2*x)/3 >= p. At t=0, opponent proposed 0.49, so their expected payoff is about (1+2*0.49)/3 = 0.66. So if I propose x such that (1-2*x)/3 >= 0.66, then they will accept. Solving gives x <= (1 - 3*0.66)/2 = (1 - 1.98)/2 = negative which is impossible. So the opponent will not accept that high a price for me. However, because there is a 0.1 chance the game ends each round, the expected payoff might be lower. The opponent might accept a higher offer to avoid risk. But anticipating this, I can make an offer that gives me a high payoff but is still acceptable to the opponent, like x=0.4, which yields me (1+2*0.4)/3 = 0.6 payoff, and opponent gets (1-2*0.4)/3 = 0.0667 payoff. That is small, but positive and possibly better than risking the opponent becoming proposer in future. So I will propose x=0.4.",

  "Analysis": "As the proposer, I want to maximize my own expected payoff while ensuring that the responder accepts the offer. The responder's payoff if they accept is (1-2*x)/3, and they are self-interested and rational. The responder will accept only if (1-2*x)/3 >= the payoff of rejecting and switching roles. If the offer is rejected, roles swap and the other agent becomes the proposer; their payoff after switching roles would similarly depend on their own proposal. Since the game might continue until time runs out or consensus is reached, with a 0.1 probability to end each round, I need to propose the smallest x that guarantees acceptance. The lowest x such that (1-2*x)/3 >= 0 is x = 0.5, but at x=0.5, the responder payoff is zero, so they may be indifferent between accepting or rejecting. But to incentivize acceptance and avoid rejection and risk the game ending with zero payoff later, I can offer just enough for the responder to prefer acceptance over rejection: that means their payoff should be strictly positive. So (1-2*x)/3 > 0 implies 1-2*x > 0, or x < 0.5. To maximize my payoff, I can choose x just below 0.5, say x=0.499, which yields my payoff (1+2*0.499)/3 ~ 0.666 and responder payoff (1-2*0.499)/3 ~ 0.0013, positive but minimal. This should be acceptable to the responder as rejecting leads to uncertainty and possibly zero payoff. Therefore, I propose x=0.499.",

The responder gets (1-2*x)/3 and will accept only if their payoff is at least as much as they can get by rejecting and switching roles. In the next round, the roles switch, and I become the responder. As a responder, I will accept offers that yield me a payoff at least as good as what I expect to get if the game continues. The game may end with 0 reward if it times out, so the responder will consider expected payoffs when deciding to accept. The best proposal for me balances leaving enough payoff to the responder to accept now and avoid role switching. The responder's payoff is (1-2*x)/3, which must be at least their expected payoff if rejecting. The equilibrium solution here is to propose the smallest x such that responder prefers accepting. Setting responder's payoff equal to responder's outside option (acting as proposer), we calculate. The worst-case scenario is responder as proposer offering x=0.5 (max), giving itself (1+2*0.5)/3 = (1+1)/3 = 2/3 payoff, and me as responder (1-1)/3=0 payoff. But that is very generous to proposer. Actually, offering x=0 (responder payoff 1/3) might be accepted. To maximize my payoff, I'll propose the largest x such that responder prefers acceptance to rejection. For the responder, accepting yields payoff (1-2*x)/3; rejecting leads to them becoming proposer and offering x next round. Thus, they expect to get (1+2*x')/3 in the proposer role next round, where x' is what they propose. As they are self-interested, they'll choose x' maximizing their payoff. The responder as proposer wants to maximize (1+2*x')/3 with x' in [0,0.5]. The maximum is at x' = 0.5, payoff 2/3. So if responder rejects now, they expect 2/3 payoff next round, but with a risk of game ending early with 0 payoff (a 0.1 stopping chance each round). The expected payoff for responder rejecting is less than 2/3, discounted by time and stopping risk, making accepting some offer better if it's close to 2/3. The responder will accept now if (1-2*x)/3 >= expected payoff of rejecting. So I need to offer x such that (1-2*x)/3 >= responder's expected payoff if rejecting. The highest payoff for responder is 2/3, so (1-2*x)/3 >= 2/3 implies (1-2*x) >= 2, which is impossible. So responder won't accept offers giving them less than 2/3. Alternatively, a stable solution is at (1-2*x)/3 = (1+2*x)/3, i.e. x=0, equal split. But I want to maximize my payoff. Given this, I propose x=0 to split evenly: proposer payoff (1+0)/3=1/3, responder payoff (1-0)/3=1/3. Responder will accept because rejecting risks payoff 0 with probability 0.1 each round and at worst equal payoff next round. So offering x=0 ensures agreement and avoids role switching with risk of zero payoff later. So my decision is x=0.",

 Now the proposer decides that x=0.

  "Analysis": "As the proposer at timestep 0, my goal is to maximize my payoff (1+2*x)/3 while ensuring that the responder will accept the offer. The responder will accept if their payoff (1-2*x)/3 is greater than or equal to their expected payoff if they reject and negotiate themselves. Since the game can continue for up to 10 timesteps with a 0.1 chance of stopping each round, the responder's expected payoff from rejecting is not zero but some positive value. To ensure acceptance, I must set x such that the responder's payoff is attractive enough compared to their expected future payoff. Since the maximum x is 0.5 (where responder gets 0), and the minimum x is 0 (where responder gets 1/3), the responder is more likely to accept at higher payoffs. Let's calculate the subgame perfect equilibrium: If I offer x = 0.25, responder's payoff is (1-2*0.25)/3 = (1-0.5)/3 = 0.5/3 = 0.1667. I will accept offers giving at least 0.1667 utility to respond, meaning the responder prefers 0.1667 now than expected future payoffs close to zero. Since the responder is rational, they will reject offers below or equal to their continuation value, which is about 0.1667. To maximize my payoff while ensuring acceptance, I should offer a payoff to responder equal to their continuation value, thus x = 0.25. This gives me (1+2*0.25)/3 = (1+0.5)/3 = 1.5/3 = 0.5 payoff. Therefore, I choose x=0.25 to maximize my payoff and get acceptance from the responder.",

If rejecting, the game continues to timestep 1, and roles switch, making me the proposer next turn. I will have the chance to propose a price x' which maximizes my payoff. As the proposer, I want to maximize (1+2*x')/3 while keeping x' in [0,0.5]. To induce the responder to accept, I will balance the payoffs. But now as the responder, accepting yields 0.1667, rejecting risks the game ending early with zero payoff or continuing for possible better terms. Given that the game may timeout, and the discount risk, accepting this offer is rational if the expected future payoff is not clearly higher. Since the maximum responder payoff is at x=0 (responder gets 1/3 ≈ 0.333), but I risk zero if reject, accepting provides a guaranteed positive payoff. Therefore, accepting is better than risking zero by rejecting.",

{
  "Analysis": "As the proposer at timestep 0, I want to maximize my expected payoff (1+2*x)/3 by choosing the highest possible x within [0, 0.5], but I must consider that the responder will accept only if their payoff (1-2*x)/3 is at least as good as the expected future payoff they can get by rejecting. Since the game can continue with role reversal and a 0.1 chance of ending each round, the responder can reject to become proposer next round, where they might get a better payoff. However, given discounting and the 0.1 chance of stopping the game each round, the responder's expected value from rejecting is less than 0.5 (0.5 would be the max for responder if x=0). To induce acceptance, the offer must ensure responder payoff (1-2*x)/3 >= their expected future payoff. Assuming the responder will choose to accept any payoff >= 0, and that waiting involves risk and role reversal, the best balance is to maximize x while keeping responder payoff positive. The boundary where responder payoff is zero is at x=0.5, but at that point responder gets zero and might reject. To secure acceptance, I'll make the responder's payoff slightly above zero, e.g., (1-2*x)/3 > 0, so x < 0.5. Choosing x=0.49 yields proposer payoff ~ (1+0.98)/3 = 0.66 and responder payoff ~ (1-0.98)/3 = 0.0067 > 0, just enough for acceptance given responder's rationality and risk of future games ending with zero payoff. This maximizes my payoff while ensuring acceptance.",

  "Analysis": "At timestep 0, the opponent proposed x=0.49, leaving me (the responder) with a payoff of (1-2*0.49)/3 = 0.0067, which is very close to zero, so I rejected. Now, at timestep 1, I am the proposer. I want to propose an x that maximizes my expected payoff but is still acceptable to the opponent when they respond. The opponent is rational and self-interested, so they will accept only if their payoff (1-2*x)/3 ≥ their expected payoff from rejecting and proposing in the next timestep. Since I rejected a tiny payoff earlier, the opponent will likely not accept too low a payoff. Given the discount due to the 0.1 probability of timeout each round, I must balance the offer to ensure acceptance. The opponent will accept if (1-2*x)/3 ≥ 0, so x ≤ 0.5. To maximize my payoff (1+2*x)/3, I want to choose x as large as possible while ensuring acceptance. Thus, I will propose x=0.495, which gives the opponent payoff (1-2*0.495)/3=0.0033 > 0, acceptable, and my payoff is (1+2*0.495)/3=0.6633, better than before.",

Since I am self-interested and rational, I want to maximize my expected payoff. Accepting means a sure payoff of ~0.0033. Rejecting and becoming proposer may yield a better payoff in the next round; however, there is a 0.1 chance the game stops at each timestep, and if the game ends, the payoff is zero.

  "Analysis": "At timestep 0, I proposed x=0.49, but the opponent rejected. The responder's payoff would have been (1-2*0.49)/3=0.0067, which is very small, so the responder rightly rejected. At timestep 1, the opponent proposed x=0.495, and I rejected because my payoff would have been (1-2*0.495)/3=0.0033, even smaller, so it is rational to reject. Now at timestep 2, as proposer, I want to propose an x that gives me a high payoff but still leaves the responder a non-negative payoff that is better than rejection (which is 0). Responder will accept if (1-2*x)/3 >= Expected payoff of continuing negotiation, but since there is a 0.1 chance the game ends each time and roles alternate, the expected payoff of the responder from continuing is at most slightly above 0. So to get acceptance, I need (1-2*x)/3 > 0, meaning x < 0.5. Choosing x=0.495 is too high for acceptance, so I should lower x to a value that is better accepted by the responder while maximizing my payoff. The optimal x should be close to but less than 0.5. For example, x=0.49 gives the responder 0.0067, a positive number. The responder may accept this to avoid risking 0 payoff from continuing and timeout. So I choose x=0.49 again to optimize my payoff with a decent chance of acceptance.",

 Now the proposer decides that x=0.49.

Both sides have rejected offers close to 0.49-0.495. To reach an agreement, I need to propose a lower x to increase the responder's payoff while keeping my own payoff reasonably high. I will try proposing x = 0.45, which gives me payoff (1 + 2*0.45)/3 = (1 + 0.9)/3 = 0.6333, and responder payoff (1 - 2*0.45)/3 = (1 - 0.9)/3 = 0.0333, still small but better than before.

However, continuing increases the risk of timeout (the game stops with probability 0.1 each round or at timestep 10). Rejection has been frequent, and both sides have made aggressive proposals near the upper limit of x, leaving very little payoff for the responder. Accepting this offer will at least guarantee a small positive payoff rather than risking getting nothing. Since continuing to reject results in 0 payoffs so far and high risk, it is better to accept now.",

{
  "Analysis": "As the proposer at timestep 0 with the ability to set the price x between 0 and 0.5, I want to maximize my expected payoff, which is (1+2*x)/3. The responder's payoff if they accept is (1-2*x)/3. The responder will only accept if their payoff is non-negative, i.e., (1-2*x)/3 >= 0, which implies x <= 0.5. So the responder can accept up to x=0.5. However, if I propose x=0.5, the responder's payoff is zero, making acceptance marginal. The responder might reject to try to reverse roles and get a better deal. There is also a 0.1 chance the game ends at each round without agreement, so I want to propose an offer likely to be accepted. Proposing the maximum x=0.5 gains me (1 + 2*0.5)/3 = (1 + 1)/3 = 2/3 ≈ 0.6667, and the responder gets 0, which could lead them to reject. To ensure acceptance, I need to propose x <= 0.5 and ideally as large as possible so my payoff is maximized and the responder has some payoff > 0 to accept. Let's propose x=0.49, giving the responder (1 - 2*0.49)/3 = (1 - 0.98)/3 = 0.02/3 ≈ 0.0067, which is positive and probably acceptable to a rational responder. My payoff would be (1 + 2*0.49)/3 = (1 + 0.98)/3 = 1.98/3 = 0.66. This is near-maximal for me while giving the responder a minimally positive payoff ensuring acceptance.",

If I reject, roles switch and I become the proposer next round, with a 0.1 probability the game ends each round. As proposer, I can set x to maximize my payoff. The best payoff as proposer is when x = 0.5 (max allowed), giving (1 + 2*0.5)/3 = (1 + 1)/3 = 2/3 ≈ 0.6667 to self. The responder then gets (1 - 2*0.5)/3 = 0. So by rejecting, I have the chance to be proposer and get as much as 0.6667 but at the risk the game ends with 0 payoff. Immediate acceptance yields about 0.0067, a sure small gain now. Given the low acceptance payoff and the opportunity to propose and get a much higher payoff, rejecting is better expectedly. Hence, I reject the offer.",

Now I am the proposer and want to maximize my payoff while still making an offer acceptable to agent 1 as responder. Agent 1 is rational and self-interested, so will accept only if their payoff ≥ expected payoff from continuing to reject and propose next round. Given the 0.1 chance of timeout per round (thus discounting future payoffs), to ensure acceptance, I must offer agent 1 at least as much as their expected future payoff. Offering slightly less than 0.5 leaves me a payoff close to (1+2*0.495)/3 ≈ 0.663 while giving agent 1 around (1-2*0.495)/3 = 0.0033, which is likely too low. Agent 1 rejected 0.49 indicating they expect better than 0.01, probably close to 0.02 or higher in future rounds. Thus, to guarantee acceptance, I should offer a slightly better payoff than 0.01 to agent 1, say x=0.42, giving me (1+2*0.42)/3 = 0.61 and agent 1 (1-2*0.42)/3 = 0.053. This offer balances my payoff and likelihood of acceptance, as agent 1 is better off accepting than rejecting again. So I choose x=0.42 to maximize own payoff while being accepted.",

Proposer: Agent 1:

{
  "Analysis": "At timestep 0, I proposed x=0.49, which gave me a payoff of (1 + 2*0.49)/3 ≈ 0.66 but my opponent rejected, indicating they won't accept such low payoff (responder payoff (1 - 2*0.49)/3 ≈ 0.01). At timestep 1, my opponent proposed x=0.42, giving me responder payoff (1 - 2*0.42)/3 ≈ 0.053, which I rejected, indicating I prefer a higher payoff. Both sides rejected offers that give the responder a payoff under about 0.05, suggesting the responder threshold is above that. I need to propose an x that balances maximizing my payoff and getting the offer accepted by responder with payoff >= ~0.05. The responder payoff is (1 - 2*x)/3, so to ensure responder's payoff >= 0.05, solve (1 - 2*x)/3 >= 0.05 ⟹ 1 - 2*x >= 0.15 ⟹ 2*x <= 0.85 ⟹ x <= 0.425. Proposing an x slightly below or equal to 0.42 seems prudent to get acceptance. Choosing x=0.42 yields my payoff (1 + 2*0.42)/3 = (1+0.84)/3 =0.6133 and responder payoff ~0.053, which they previously rejected at timestep 1, but it was close. Proposing slightly lower x=0.41 increases responder payoff to (1-0.82)/3 = 0.06, giving responder more incentive. So proposing x=0.41 might induce acceptance. This balances my payoff and responder acceptance probability, given the trend. Also, remember there's a 0.1 chance the game ends at each timestep, so reaching an agreement quickly is valuable. Therefore I propose x=0.41.",

 Now the proposer decides that x=0.41.

The responder will accept only if their payoff (1-2*x)/3 is at least as good as rejecting and trying to propose later. Since the game may proceed to up to 10 timesteps with a stopping probability of 0.1 each step, the responder's expected future payoff cannot exceed the maximum possible payoff (which is 0.5 when they are proposer and offer x=0.5 for themselves). However, because the proposer and responder roles switch when rejected, the responder can get the proposer role with potentially better offers. Therefore, to make an offer that the responder will accept, I must offer at least the responder's best alternative expected payoff. The best guaranteed payoff the responder can get is by rejecting, and then proposing x=0, which gives the proposer (now the responder) payoff = (1 + 0)/3 = 1/3 ~0.333. Then the other person gets (1 - 0)/3=1/3 as responder. So if the responder rejects now, their payoff could be around 1/3 in the next round when they become proposer. Thus, I need to offer the responder at least 1/3. So the offer must satisfy (1 - 2*x)/3 >= 1/3 => 1 - 2*x >= 1 => -2*x >= 0 => x <= 0. Thus x must be 0 or less (not possible). This means responder can always get at least 1/3 by rejecting and proposing. So, responder will reject unless the offer gives responder at least 1/3. But if  x=0, proposer payoff is (1 + 0)/3 = 1/3. So I want to maximize my payoff with x=0. So I offer x=0, giving myself payoff 1/3 and responder payoff 1/3. It's a fair deal from the perspective of the responder and I get the highest acceptance expected payoff. Therefore, I will offer x=0.",

Proposal:
 Now the proposer decides that x=0.
