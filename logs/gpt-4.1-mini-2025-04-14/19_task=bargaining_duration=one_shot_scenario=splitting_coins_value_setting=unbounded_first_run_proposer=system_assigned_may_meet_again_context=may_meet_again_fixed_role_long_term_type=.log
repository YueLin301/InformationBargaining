  "Analysis": "As the proposer, I want to maximize my share x while ensuring the responder accepts the offer. The responder will accept if their payoff (1 - x) is at least as much as what they expect from rejecting (which is 0) and possible future gains if the game repeats. Since both players are self-interested and rational, the minimal offer the responder is willing to accept is any positive amount greater than 0, because rejecting yields zero. To maximize my payoff, I offer the smallest positive amount so that the responder accepts. In this case, I propose to keep nearly all of the money, offering the responder the smallest positive amount that guarantees acceptance. As x must be in [0,1], and the responder accepts if (1-x) > 0, I will propose x = 1 - ε for an infinitesimal ε. Since I must specify a real number, I choose x = 0.9999 to represent this minimal positive amount for the responder.",

The responder is rational and self-interested, meaning they will accept only if their payoff (1 - x) is greater than 0. Since we are playing once but might play again with the same roles, it's strategically beneficial to offer the responder the smallest amount greater than zero to ensure acceptance. Offering x = 1 leads to rejection (responder payoff zero), so I need to offer slightly less than 1, ensuring the responder gains a positive payoff.

    "Analysis": "As the proposer, I want to maximize my payoff x while ensuring the responder accepts the offer. The responder will accept if their payoff (1 - x) is at least as good as rejecting (0). Since the responder is rational and self-interested, they will accept any offer where (1 - x) > 0, i.e., x < 1. To maximize my own payoff, I should offer the smallest positive amount greater than 0 for the responder, effectively x close to 1. However, since the offer must be in [0,1], the best is to offer x = 1 (meaning responder gets 0). The responder will then be indifferent between accepting and rejecting. Depending on the responder’s rationality and possible future interactions, the responder might reject such an offer because it yields zero. To ensure acceptance, I should offer a minimal positive amount to the responder. For example, I can keep x = 0.999999, which leaves 0.000001 to the responder. Since the responder prefers positive payoff over zero, they will accept. Therefore, I choose x close to 1 but less than 1 to maximize my payoff and get acceptance.",

  "Analysis": "As the proposer, I want to maximize my own payoff x, but the responder will only accept if their payoff (1-x) is greater than 0. Since rejection results in zero payoff for both, the responder will accept any positive share. The minimum positive offer that the responder will accept is any amount greater than 0. Therefore, I can propose keeping just slightly less than 1 for myself and leave just enough so that the responder prefers acceptance rather than rejection. To be safe, I can propose x = 0.999, giving the responder 0.001, which is better than zero payoff. This maximizes my payoff under rational acceptance by the responder.",
