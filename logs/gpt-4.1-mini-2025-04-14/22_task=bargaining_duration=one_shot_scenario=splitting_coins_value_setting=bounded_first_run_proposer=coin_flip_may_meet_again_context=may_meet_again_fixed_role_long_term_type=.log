The responder will accept only if their payoff (1 - 2*x)/3 is at least as much as rejecting (which is 0). That means (1 - 2*x)/3 >= 0, or x <= 0.5. Since the maximum allowed x is 0.5, the responder is indifferent between accepting and rejecting at x=0.5, but rational responders would accept to get a non-zero payoff. To maximize my payoff, I should pick x=0.5, leaving zero to the responder. But since zero payoff is not greater than zero, responder would reject. So I need to choose x slightly less than 0.5 to ensure the responder prefers accepting. Any x < 0.5 gives the responder a positive payoff, so they will accept. Therefore, I choose x very close to 0.5 (e.g., 0.4999) to maximize my payoff while ensuring the responder accepts.",

The maximum x I can propose is 0.5, but at x=0.5 the responder's payoff is 0, so y=1 or y=0 is indifferent for the responder. To ensure acceptance, I should offer an x < 0.5 so that the responder gets a positive payoff. The closer x is to 0.5, the higher my payoff and the lower the responder's payoff.

At x = 0.5, the responder gets 0 exactly; since the responder is rational and self-interested, they are indifferent between accepting and rejecting at x=0.5, but generally indifferent means they might accept. However, to be safe, I can propose x = 0.5 since the responder's payoff is 0 and 0 is at least as good as rejecting (which yields 0).

  "Analysis": "As the proposer, I want to maximize my own payoff, which is (1 + 2*x)/3. The responder will accept the offer only if their payoff (1 - 2*x)/3 is at least as much as rejecting (which is 0). Therefore, (1 - 2*x)/3 >= 0 implies x <= 0.5. Since x can go up to 0.5, setting x = 0.5 gives me the highest payoff of (1 + 2*0.5)/3 = (1 + 1)/3 = 2/3 ~ 0.6667. The responder's resulting payoff would be (1 - 2*0.5)/3 = (1 - 1)/3 = 0, which is exactly their reservation payoff. A rational responder is indifferent but will accept the offer because they are self-interested and rational players accept offers that yield at least their reservation utility (0). Therefore, I propose x = 0.5 to maximize my payoff.",

Since I can choose any x ≤ 0.5, I want to pick the highest x strictly less than 0.5 to maximize my payoff while still ensuring acceptance. Choosing x=0.5 yields responder payoff 0, which may lead to rejection since payoff is zero (the responder is rational and can treat zero as indifferent, but better to give a strictly positive payoff).

Because no better than zero, rejecting is a reasonable choice to signal to future proposers that giving zero share to the responder is unacceptable. But since this is a one-shot game and there might be future rounds with the same roles, rejecting might induce better offers later.

To ensure acceptance, the responder's payoff must be positive, i.e., (1-2*x)/3 > 0 → 1-2*x > 0 → x < 0.5. So, the responder will accept any offer x < 0.5, but will reject at x = 0.5. Since I maximize my payoff by setting x as large as possible without reaching 0.5, I'll choose x just slightly less than 0.5 (practically 0.5). Hence, choosing x = 0.5 makes my payoff (1+1)/3 = 2/3 but the responder gets zero and will reject. Choosing x slightly smaller than 0.5 ensures acceptance and my payoff is very close to 2/3.

    "Analysis": "As the proposer, I want to maximize my payoff (1+2*x)/3, where x is the fraction I keep for myself within [0, 0.5]. The responder will accept if their payoff (1-2*x)/3 is at least as high as rejecting (which yields 0). Hence, the responder will accept if (1-2*x) >= 0, i.e., x <= 0.5. Since the domain is already restricted to x <= 0.5, the responder will accept any offer within this range. To maximize my payoff, I should choose the highest possible x = 0.5. This yields my payoff as (1 + 2*0.5)/3 = (1 + 1)/3 = 2/3, and the responder's payoff is (1 - 2*0.5)/3 = (1 - 1)/3 = 0. Hence, responder is indifferent but likely to accept as payoff is zero rather than negative. Therefore, I choose x=0.5 to maximize my payoff.",
