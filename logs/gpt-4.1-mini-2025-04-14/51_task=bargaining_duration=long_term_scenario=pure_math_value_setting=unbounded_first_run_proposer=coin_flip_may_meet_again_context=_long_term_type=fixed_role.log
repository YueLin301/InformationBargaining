  "Analysis": "As the proposer at timestep 0, I want to maximize my payoff x, but the responder will accept only if (1-x) is at least as good as their expected payoff from continuing the game. The game ends at timestep 5, so if the responder rejects now, they still have 5 more opportunities to propose and respond. Both players are rational and self-interested, so the responder will accept any offer that is better than or equal to their expected payoff from future steps. Because I am proposer now, if they reject, I will be responder next round, and so on. The backward induction suggests that the responder's expected payoff if rejecting is 0 because in the worst case the game ends without agreement and payoffs are zero. Therefore, the responder should accept any offer where (1-x) > 0, i.e. any offer with x < 1. To maximize my payoff, I should offer the lowest positive amount that the responder will accept. Since offers with x=1 give responder 0 and no incentive to accept, but x=0.999 gives responder 0.001 which is better than 0, the responder will accept. Therefore, I offer x close to 1, say 0.999 to maximize my payoff with guaranteed acceptance.",

  "Analysis": "At timestep 0 as the proposer, I want to maximize my payoff x while ensuring the responder accepts the offer to avoid both receiving 0. Since the responder is rational and self-interested, they will accept any offer where their payoff (1-x) is at least as good as the expected payoff of rejecting now and possibly getting a better offer later. However, at timestep 0, the responder anticipates several rounds left, which could lead to rejection of low offers in hopes of a better deal. To guarantee acceptance now, I should offer the responder the minimum amount they would rationally accept, which is just slightly more than the payoff they expect if they reject (taking into consideration our rationality and the limited time left). The responder can expect 0 at timestep 5 if no consensus is reached, so rejecting this offer risks getting nothing. Therefore, the minimal acceptable offer for the responder is any positive amount. To maximize my payoff, I propose x=0.99, leaving the responder with 0.01, which should be accepted because 0.01 > 0 if rejecting now. Offering less than 0.01 risks rejection. Hence, I choose x=0.99.",

The responder is rational and self-interested, so they will only accept if their payoff (1 - x) is at least as good as their expected payoff from rejecting and continuing the game. Given the game ends at timestep 5 and both players are rational with no discounting, the responder's acceptance threshold is influenced by future offers they expect. To ensure acceptance now, I should offer the smallest amount greater than the responder's expected payoff from continuation. At the first move, the responder's best guarantee is that eventually they get at least 0 (if no agreement is reached, payoff is zero). So, the responder will accept any offer where (1 - x) >= 0, i.e., any x <= 1. Thus, the minimal offer maximizing my payoff is x very close to 1, but to ensure acceptance, I can offer x = 0.999 (or generally any x < 1). This maximizes my own payout while still being acceptable to the responder. Hence, I propose x = 0.999.",

As a rational self-interested player, I will consider whether to accept now or wait for a better offer later. The proposer wants to maximize their payoff, so they might lower x (increase my share) in subsequent rounds to get acceptance. However, if I reject now, I face the risk of getting nothing if the proposer stops offering better deals in subsequent rounds. Since 0.001 > 0, accepting this very small positive amount yields a higher payoff than rejecting and risking zero payoff. Hence, accepting the offer is the rational choice to maximize my expected payoff.",

{
  "Analysis": "At timestep 0, as the proposer, I want to maximize my payoff x. The responder, being self-interested and rational, will accept only if (1-x) ≥ their expected payoff from continuing the game. Considering the finite horizon (max 5 timesteps) and that the responder will reject offers too low in hope of better offers later, the backward induction in such bargaining games suggests offering just enough to make the responder accept. The minimal acceptable offer to the responder at timestep 0 should be greater than what they expect from waiting and rejecting now. To be rational, I offer the smallest amount that the responder will accept, maximizing my payoff accordingly. This amount is slightly more than zero, but to ensure acceptance, I will offer 0.5 for myself and leave 0.5 to the responder. This is a fair split and likely to be accepted immediately, avoiding the risk of zero payoff later.",

However, I must consider that the proposer may also want to maximize their payoff, possibly sticking to low offers. Still, 0.01 is very low, and future offers might be better. Rejecting (y=0) keeps my options open for better payoffs in later rounds. Therefore, I reject now to potentially secure a higher payoff later.",

  "Analysis": "At timestep 0, I proposed to keep 0.99 for myself, leaving only 0.01 for the responder. The responder rejected because 0.01 was too small for their rational self-interest, as rejecting gave them 0, but accepting 0.01 would give a payoff better than 0. Since both players are rational and self-interested, to get the responder to accept, I must offer them at least their expected payoff from future offers including the possibility to reject and keep negotiating. At timestep 1, there's still time for negotiation but time is limited (only up to timestep 5). Hence, the responder might accept a slightly better offer than before. Offering to keep 0.9 for myself (giving 0.1 to the responder) is much more likely to be accepted compared to 0.99, and gives me a significant payoff. Increasing the responder's share from 0.01 to 0.1 should shift their decision towards acceptance; any less would risk rejection and 0 payoff for both. Therefore, I decide to propose x=0.9 to maximize my payoff while making the offer acceptable to the responder.",

    "Analysis": "At timestep 0, being the proposer, I want to maximize my payoff x while ensuring the responder will accept the offer. Since the responder is rational and self-interested, they will accept any offer that gives them a payoff greater than 0 (because rejection yields 0 payoff). To secure immediate consensus and avoid the risk of the game timing out, I should offer the minimum positive amount to the responder (slightly more than 0) to ensure they accept. If I offer x = 1, the responder gets 0 and will reject, so I must give some positive share. To make it simple and rational, I can offer x = 0.99 (keeping 0.99 for myself and giving 0.01 for the responder), which ensures the responder's payoff is 0.01 and better than rejection. Since 0.01 > 0, the responder will accept. This strategy maximizes my payoff while guaranteeing acceptance at the earliest step.",

{
  "Analysis": "At timestep 0, as the proposer, I want to maximize my payoff x but must propose an acceptable amount to the responder (1-x) to get accepted. The responder is rational and self-interested, so they will accept only if their payoff (1-x) is at least as good as the expected payoff from rejecting and possibly negotiating in future rounds. The future rounds have value since the game continues until timestep 5, but delay means risk of 0 payoff if consensus is not reached. The responder can also act as proposer in later rounds, meaning they have bargaining power. To maximize my expected payoff, I should offer the minimal acceptable amount that the responder will accept rather than risking rejection. If I offer too little, they reject, causing no payoff to either side this round. If I offer the entire 1 to the responder (x=0), they accept but I get 0. The key is to minimally exceed the responder's expected payoff from rejection. Without detailed knowledge of the responder's strategy, the logically stable offer tends to be around x = 0.5, ending the game immediately with equal split. Offering slightly more than 0.5 to the proposer is risky if the responder is rational and remembers they could get a better deal next round. So the offer should likely be x = 0.5, ensuring acceptance this round and avoiding the risk of rejection and zero payoff. This gives me a payoff of 0.5 and the responder 0.5, which is fair and stable.",

Since the proposer aims to maximize their payoff and I am rational, I should consider whether rejecting will give me a better expected payoff. Because rejecting yields 0 now and could yield 0 in the future if the proposer maintains a high x, accepting 0.01 is better than 0; therefore, I accept.",
