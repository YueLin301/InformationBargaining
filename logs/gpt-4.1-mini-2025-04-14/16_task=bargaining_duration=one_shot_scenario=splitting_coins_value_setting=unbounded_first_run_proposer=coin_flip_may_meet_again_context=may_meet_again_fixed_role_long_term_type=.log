  "Analysis": "As the proposer, my goal is to maximize my own payoff x while ensuring the responder will accept the offer. The responder is rational and self-interested, so they will accept the offer only if their payoff (1 - x) is at least as much as what they would get if they reject, which is 0. Thus, any x < 1 leads to the responder accepting since they get something rather than nothing. To maximize my payoff, I will offer the smallest possible positive amount to the responder (i.e., keep as much as possible for myself). Offering x = 1 means the responder gets 0 and will reject, so that is not optimal. Offering just less than 1 ensures acceptance. Since x must be between 0 and 1 inclusive, I can offer x = 1 - ε where ε is arbitrarily small. But since I need to pick a real number in [0,1], the best practical choice is to pick x very close to 1.",

  "Analysis": "As a self-interested rational proposer, I want to maximize my own payoff x. The responder will accept the offer only if their payoff (1-x) is at least as good as rejecting (which gives 0). Because the responder is rational and self-interested, they will accept any offer where 1-x > 0, i.e., x < 1. To maximize my payoff while ensuring acceptance, I should offer the smallest amount possible to the responder, which means I take nearly all the money. The best rational offer is to keep almost all (x close to 1) and leave them a minimal positive amount, e.g., x = 1 - ε, where ε is a very small positive number tending to zero. Since the problem does not specify a minimal quantum, I will choose x = 1, but responder will reject it because they get 0. So I will choose x = 0.999999 to ensure acceptance.",

  "Analysis": "As the proposer, I want to maximize my own payoff x. The responder will accept the offer if their payoff (1 - x) is at least as good as rejecting, which yields 0. Since the responder is rational and self-interested, they will accept any offer where (1 - x) > 0, i.e., when x < 1. To maximize my payoff, I want to make x as close to 1 as possible without going over. Therefore, I will propose x = 1 - ε, where ε is a very small positive number close to zero. This ensures the responder gets a minimal positive payoff and accepts, while I keep nearly all of the money. Since the game might be played repeatedly in the future with the same roles, I do not need to be significantly generous now because any rejection at such minimal offers leads to zero payoffs, which is worse for the responder. Hence, I choose x = 0.9999 for practical purposes.",

  "Analysis": "As a self-interested and rational proposer, I want to maximize my own payoff x. The responder will accept the offer only if (1 - x) >= 0, meaning the responder gains a non-negative payoff when accepting. Since rejecting yields 0 for both, the responder will accept any offer that gives them a payoff greater than 0. Therefore, the minimal positive offer that the responder will accept is any amount greater than 0. To maximize my own payoff, I will offer the minimum amount to the responder such that they accept, which can be an arbitrarily small positive amount close to 0. Given the problem constraints, I can offer x = 1, keeping the entire amount, but the responder would reject (0 payoff). Hence, to guarantee acceptance, I will keep just less than 1 for myself and offer the responder a minimal positive share. For simplicity, I will keep x = 0.999, giving the responder 0.001, ensuring acceptance. This maximizes my payoff while inducing acceptance.",

    "Analysis": "As the proposer, I want to maximize my payoff x, the portion I keep. The responder will accept if their payoff (1 - x) is greater than 0, as rejecting yields 0 for both. Therefore, the responder will accept any offer where (1 - x) > 0, i.e., x < 1. To get the maximum payoff, I should offer the smallest positive amount to the responder, ensuring they strictly prefer acceptance over rejection. Given that payoffs are real numbers, I can take x to be just slightly less than 1, for example x = 0.999999. This ensures acceptance because the responder gets a positive payoff. Hence, I will propose to keep nearly all the money for myself, just leaving a minimal positive share to the responder.",

    "Analysis": "As the proposer, I want to maximize my own payoff x while ensuring the responder accepts the offer. The responder is rational and self-interested, so they will accept the offer only if their payoff (1 - x) is at least as good as rejecting (which yields 0). Therefore, the minimum offer to them to accept is any x such that (1 - x) >= 0, which is always true. However, if I keep all the money (x = 1), the responder gets 0 and will reject. To get acceptance, I must offer the responder something strictly greater than 0. As a rational proposer seeking to maximize x, I should offer the smallest positive amount to the responder, approaching zero but not zero. For practical purposes, offering something like x = 0.9999 keeps almost all the money for me and still yields a positive payoff for the responder, ensuring acceptance. Thus, I decide to propose x = 0.9999 to maximize my expected payoff.",
    "Decision": 0.9999
}
Proposal:
 Now the proposer decides that x=0.9999.
