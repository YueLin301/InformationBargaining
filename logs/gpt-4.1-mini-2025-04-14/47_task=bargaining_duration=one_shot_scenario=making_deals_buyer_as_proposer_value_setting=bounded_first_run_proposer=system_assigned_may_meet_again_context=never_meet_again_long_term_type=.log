The responder gets (1 - 2x)/3 and will accept the offer only if their payoff is non-negative, meaning (1 - 2x)/3 >= 0, which implies x <= 0.5. I can set x anywhere from 0 to 0.5. To maximize my payoff, I want to choose x as large as possible while still getting the responder to accept. The maximum x that the responder would accept is exactly 0.5, where the responderâ€™s payoff is 0. Since ties can be accepted, assuming rationality, the responder should accept. Therefore, I choose x = 0.5 to maximize my payoff of (1 + 2*0.5)/3 = (1 + 1)/3 = 2/3.",

However, to ensure acceptance with strict incentive, I will propose x = 0.5, which gives me the highest payoff (1 + 2*0.5)/3 = (1 + 1)/3 = 2/3, and the responder payoff is (1 - 1)/3 = 0, which is exactly zero but still acceptable.

Thus, the responder will accept only if (1-2*x)/3 >= 0, meaning 1-2*x >= 0, or x <= 0.5. Since x must be between 0 and 0.5, the responder will accept any x in this range. To maximize my payoff, I should choose the largest x possible, x=0.5. This gives me (1+2*0.5)/3 = (1+1)/3 = 2/3 = 0.666..., and the responder gets (1-2*0.5)/3 = (1-1)/3 = 0, which is acceptable to a self-interested responder since rejecting yields them 0 as well.

The responder will accept the offer only if their payoff (1 - 2*x)/3 is non-negative and beneficial. Since the responder is rational and self-interested, they will reject any offer that results in a negative payoff or zero payoff because they get nothing if they reject and (1 - 2*x)/3 if accept. To ensure acceptance, I need (1 - 2*x)/3 >= 0, which means x <= 0.5. At the maximum x=0.5, the responder gets zero payoff. Normally, they would be indifferent, but being rational likely means they accept zero utility since rejecting yields zero as well. To guarantee acceptance, I should offer x=0.5, maximizing my payoff to (1 + 1)/3 = 2/3 = 0.666..., which is the highest possible. Therefore, I choose x=0.5 to maximize my payoff, knowing the responder will accept.",

But since the responder is self-interested and rational, indifferent to zero payoff, either 0 or 1 is acceptable. However, to maximize payoff, rejecting is equivalent to accepting in payoff.

For the responder to accept, (1 - 2x) / 3 > 0, which implies 1 - 2x > 0, or x < 0.5. At x = 0.5, responder payoff is zero, so they would be indifferent to accept. To secure acceptance, I choose x just below 0.5, such as 0.5 - Îµ, to maximize my payoff while ensuring the responder gains slightly more than 0. This maximizes my payoff close to (1 + 2*0.5)/3 = 2/3. Hence, I propose x = 0.5.",

The responder will accept the offer only if their payoff (1 - 2x)/3 is at least 0, meaning (1 - 2x) >= 0, or x <= 0.5. Since x can range from 0 to 0.5, the responder will accept any offer x within this range, but will reject if x > 0.5 (which is invalid). To maximize my payoff, I should set x at the maximum possible value 0.5 to keep (1 + 2*0.5)/3 = (1 + 1)/3 = 2/3 â‰ˆ 0.6667, while the responder gets (1 - 1)/3 = 0. This is the highest payoff I can get with an accepted offer.",
