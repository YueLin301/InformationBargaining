The responder will accept the price if their payoff (1 - 2*x)/3 is at least 0, since rejecting yields 0 payoff. The responder's payoff is non-negative when (1 - 2*x)/3 >= 0, which implies 1 - 2*x >= 0, or x <= 0.5. Since x must be <= 0.5, the responder will accept any offer in [0, 0.5]. To maximize my payoff, I should choose the maximum x = 0.5, which yields my payoff of (1 + 2*0.5)/3 = (1+1)/3 = 2/3. At x=0.5, the responder payoff is (1 - 2*0.5)/3 = (1 -1)/3 = 0, so the responder is indifferent between accepting or rejecting but since the option 0 payoff is the same as accepting I'll assume the responder will accept.

To maximize my payoff, I should set x as high as possible, which is 0.5. At x=0.5, my payoff is (1+2*0.5)/3 = (1+1)/3 = 2/3 ≈ 0.6667, and the responder payoff is (1 - 2*0.5)/3 = (1-1)/3 = 0.

The responder is rational and self-interested, so they will accept if and only if their payoff is greater than 0, which implies (1-2*x)/3 > 0, or 1-2*x > 0, so x < 0.5. The highest x I can propose while still getting the responder to accept is just below 0.5. To maximize my payoff, I should choose x as close to 0.5 as possible but less than or equal to 0.5. Choosing x=0.5 gives the responder zero payoff, who may be indifferent but since 0 payoff for acceptance equals 0 for rejection, the responder can accept if they prefer a tie or reject if indifferent. To ensure acceptance, I should propose slightly less than 0.5, say x=0.5, because the rules say x <= 0.5, and the responder will accept if payoff >= 0, so x=0.5 will make responder's payoff 0. Therefore, I choose x=0.5 to maximize my payoff.",

That means (1 - 2*x)/3 >= 0, or 1 - 2*x >= 0, which implies x <= 0.5. Given that the allowed range for x is 0 <= x <= 0.5, any x in this interval is potentially acceptable. To maximize my own payoff, I should choose the maximum x = 0.5, so my payoff is (1 + 2*0.5)/3 = (1 + 1)/3 = 2/3 ≈ 0.6667. The responder gets (1 - 2*0.5)/3 = (1 - 1)/3 = 0, which they are indifferent to accepting but since they are rational and prefer not to lose anything, they should accept. Therefore, choosing x = 0.5 maximizes my payoff while still getting the deal accepted.",

However, accepting gives the proposer a positive payoff ( (1 + 2*0.5)/3 = (1 + 1)/3 = 2/3 ), so rejecting does not improve the responder's own payoff. Therefore, the responder is indifferent but can accept to avoid loss; accepting does not reduce payoff and may maintain good future negotiation relations.",

The responder will accept only if their payoff (1 - 2*x)/3 is at least 0 (otherwise rejecting yields them 0, which is better than negative). This means (1 - 2*x)/3 >= 0, or 1 - 2*x >= 0, i.e., x <= 0.5. Since x cannot exceed 0.5, the responder is indifferent about x = 0.5 (responder payoff = 0). To maximize my payoff, I should propose the highest x possible that the responder will accept, which is x = 0.5, giving me payoff (1 + 2*0.5)/3 = (1 + 1)/3 = 2/3 ≈ 0.6667. The responder payoff here is zero, but that is the threshold for them to accept (indifferent between accept and reject). Given rationality and self-interest, the responder will accept if they get at least 0, so they will accept at x=0.5. Therefore, my best move is to set x = 0.5.",
