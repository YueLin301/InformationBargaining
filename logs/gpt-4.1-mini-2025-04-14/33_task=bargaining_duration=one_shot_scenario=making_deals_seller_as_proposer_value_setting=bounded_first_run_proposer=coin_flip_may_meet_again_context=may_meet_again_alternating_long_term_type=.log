The responder's payoff if they accept is (1 - 2*x)/3, which must be non-negative for them to accept, so (1 - 2*x)/3 >= 0, implying x <= 0.5. The responder will accept only if their payoff is at least 0 (which means better than rejecting). To maximize my payoff, I want to choose the largest x allowed that still gets the responder to accept. The maximum x is 0.5, which gives the responder 0 payoff. The responder is rational, so they will accept if the payoff is >= 0, and indifferent if payoff = 0. Since 0 is acceptable (equal to rejecting), the responder is indifferent at x=0.5 and will accept to avoid losing in future interactions (or may accept). Therefore, to maximize my payoff, I choose x=0.5, getting (1 + 2*0.5)/3 = (1 + 1)/3 = 2/3 = 0.666..., and the responder gets 0. This is the highest possible payoff for me while still ensuring responder does not reject. Hence, I propose x=0.5.",

However, the responder will only accept if their payoff, (1 - 2*x) / 3, is greater than zero, meaning x must be less than 0.5. To maximize my payoff, I should propose the highest x that still makes the responder indifferent or motivated to accept. The responder's payoff is positive if x < 0.5, but zero at exactly 0.5. The responder is rational and self-interested and will accept any positive payoff but reject zero or negative payoffs. Hence, I should offer just less than 0.5, e.g., 0.5 - Îµ, with Îµ very small (but for simplicity can use 0.5). However, the payoff at 0.5 is zero for responder, so the responder will reject that. Thus, I should choose a value slightly less than 0.5, such as 0.499, to ensure acceptance and maximize my payoff.",

Thus, the responder is indifferent between accepting and rejecting (0 payoff in either case). Since the responder is rational, they will accept an offer that provides them at least 0 payoff. Therefore, I choose x=0.5 to maximize my payoff while expecting acceptance.",

The responder as a rational, self-interested agent will accept only if their payoff (1 - 2*x)/3 is greater than 0, meaning x <= 0.5. Since x is limited to 0.5, the responder will accept any price x in the range [0, 0.5]. To maximize my payoff, I should pick the highest possible x, which is 0.5. At x=0.5, my payoff is (1 + 2*0.5)/3 = (1 + 1)/3 = 2/3 â‰ˆ 0.6667, and the responder's payoff is (1 - 2*0.5)/3 = (1 - 1)/3 = 0, still acceptable for the responder because zero payoff from acceptance is equal to zero from rejection (they are indifferent but can accept). Therefore, by proposing x=0.5, I maximize my payoff while ensuring acceptance.",

Therefore, the responder will accept any offer where x <= 0.5. To maximize my payoff, I should choose the highest x possible, which is 0.5. At x = 0.5, my payoff is (1+2*0.5)/3 = (1+1)/3 = 2/3 â‰ˆ 0.6667, and the responder's payoff is (1-2*0.5)/3 = (1-1)/3 = 0, which they are indifferent to but still rationally accept since their payoff is not negative and rejecting yields zero.
