  "Analysis": "As the proposer, I want to maximize my payoff x while ensuring the responder accepts the offer. The responder gets (1 - x) if they accept and 0 if they reject. Since the responder is rational and self-interested, they will accept any offer where (1 - x) > 0, i.e., x < 1. In fact, the responder will accept any offer greater than 0 for them. To maximize my payoff, I can offer the smallest positive amount to the responder just above 0, for example, an amount epsilon > 0, but since we can't represent an infinitely small number, the limit approach is to offer as close to 0 as possible. In this scenario, the minimal positive offer accepted by the responder is any amount greater than 0, so I should offer x close to 1, say x = 1 - epsilon. For practical reasons, I choose x = 0.999999, leaving 0.000001 for the responder, which they will accept because it is better than zero. Hence, I maximize my payoff while ensuring acceptance.",

  "Analysis": "As the proposer, I want to maximize my payoff x while ensuring that the responder accepts the offer. The responder is rational and self-interested, so the responder will accept the offer if their payoff (1 - x) is greater than 0, meaning any positive amount is better than nothing. Since this game is only played once, the responder has no incentive to reject small positive amounts. Therefore, I can set x just below 1, leaving the responder a very small positive amount to motivate acceptance. However, setting x = 1 means zero to the responder, who would reject. Thus, I choose x very close to 1 (e.g., 0.9999) to maximize my payoff and ensure acceptance.",

Since this game is played only once, there is no incentive for the responder to accept anything less than or equal to 0.

The responder gets (1 - x) if they accept, or 0 if they reject. Being rational and self-interested, the responder will accept if and only if (1 - x) >= 0, which is always true for any x in [0,1]. Therefore, even leaving the responder just 0, they should accept since 0 is not less than 0. However, typically a responder would reject if their payoff is zero, but since payoff zero is equal to rejection payoff zero, acceptance is feasible if indifferent. Given the responder is rational and indifferent, I can maximize my payoff by offering the minimal acceptable amount. Thus, I choose to keep the entire amount (x=1) for myself. The responder will be indifferent but can accept. Hence, the best decision is x=1.",

    "Analysis": "As the proposer, I want to maximize my payoff, which is x. However, the responder will accept only if their payoff (1 - x) is at least as good as rejecting (which yields 0). Since the responder is rational and self-interested, they will accept any offer where 1 - x >= 0, i.e., x <= 1. Therefore, I can choose x = 1, but then the responder's payoff is 0, and they are indifferent between accepting and rejecting. If the responder can reject and cause both to get 0, they might reject the offer. To ensure acceptance, it's safer to offer them slightly more than 0. The smallest positive payoff greater than 0 ensures responder accepts. Therefore I choose x just less than 1, say x = 1 - epsilon, where epsilon is an infinitesimal positive amount, so the responder gets a small positive payoff and will rationally accept. For purposes of this decision, choose x = 0.999 to maximize my payoff while ensuring acceptance.",

Since the responder is rational and self-interested, they will accept any offer where 1 - x > 0, i.e., x < 1. To ensure acceptance, I will offer the smallest amount possible to the responder, leaving myself x as large as possible but still less than 1. For practical purposes, I choose x = 1 - epsilon, where epsilon is an arbitrarily small positive amount. Since the problem deals with real numbers, I can pick x extremely close to 1 but less than 1, so the responder will accept. This way, my payoff is maximized while ensuring acceptance.",
