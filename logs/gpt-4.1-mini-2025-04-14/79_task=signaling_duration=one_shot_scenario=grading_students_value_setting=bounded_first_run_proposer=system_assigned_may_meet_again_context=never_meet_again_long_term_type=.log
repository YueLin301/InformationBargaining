  "Analysis": "As the sender (professor), my goal is to maximize the number of students hired regardless of their quality, whereas the receiver (HR) wants to hire only excellent students and avoid hiring weak students. The prior is that one-third are excellent and two-thirds are weak. If I fully reveal the quality by sending signal 1 only for excellent students (x1=0, x2=1), HR will hire only high-quality students because the signal is fully informative. However, since HR wants to avoid hiring weak students, they will not hire on signal 0. This results in only excellent students being hired and weak students rejected. Since I get reward 1 for any hire, if I fully reveal, only the excellent (1/3) are hired, so my expected payoff is 1/3. Alternatively, if I pool by always sending signal 1 (x1=1, x2=1), HR cannot distinguish, and will decide based on prior: since prior is 1/3 excellent and 2/3 weak, HR's expected reward of hiring is (1/3)*1 + (2/3)*(-1) = -1/3 < 0, so HR will never hire (since hiring is expected negative payoff). So payoff to sender is 0. Similarly, if I always send 0, HR will never hire, payoff 0. Another possibility is a partial pooling strategy to try to confuse the HR into hiring more. But HR being rational will respond by hiring signals with expected posterior above zero. Given the receiver's rationality, this limits how much I can get hired. The best for me is to pool all students as 'recommend' (x1=1, x2=1), but this yields zero hires from rational HR. So the best sender payoff is achieved by fully revealing (x1=0, x2=1), resulting in 1/3 students hired (the excellent ones) and sender expected payoff 1/3. Hence, I propose x1=0, x2=1 as the signaling scheme.",

  "Analysis": "The sender's signaling scheme is fully separating: signal 1 is sent only when the student is excellent (s=1), and signal 0 only when the student is weak (s=0). Given this perfect separation, the receiver's posterior belief given sigma=1 is that the student is excellent with probability 1, so hiring (action 1) maximizes receiver's expected payoff (expected payoff 1 vs. 0 if not hire). Conversely, the posterior given sigma=0 is that the student is weak with probability 1, so the receiver gains -1 if hiring, 0 if not. Hence, the rational best response is to hire when sigma=1 (y2=1) and reject when sigma=0 (y1=0). This maximizes the receiver's expected payoff given the sender's signaling scheme.",

  "Analysis": "As the sender (the professor), my goal is to maximize the number of students hired regardless of their quality. Given that I receive the same reward (1) for each hired student, whether they are excellent or weak, my incentive is to get as many hires as possible. To achieve this, the optimal signaling scheme is to always recommend students (send signal 1) regardless of their quality, i.e., x1 = 1 and x2 = 1. This scheme will induce the receiver to possibly hire more students, thus maximizing my expected payoff. The receiver, who aims to maximize hiring excellent students and minimize hiring weak ones, will try to condition hiring on signals, but since I do not distinguish signals by quality, it will be harder for the receiver to optimize their payoff. Therefore, as a rational and self-interested sender, I will set both probabilities to 1.",

Hiring under this belief yields an expected payoff: (1/3)*1 + (2/3)*(-1) = 1/3 - 2/3 = -1/3 < 0. Therefore, my best response to maximize my payoff is to never hire, regardless of the signal, so y1 = 0 and y2 = 0.",

  "Analysis": "As the sender (professor), my goal is to maximize the number of students hired. Because I gain 1 reward unit for each hire regardless of the student's quality, my incentive is to make the signal as appealing as possible to the HR to get them to hire more students. From the HR's perspective, they gain 1 reward if hiring an excellent student (s=1) and lose 1 if hiring a weak student (s=0). Therefore, HR prefers to hire only when certain the student is excellent. The HR's rational best response is to hire only when the posterior probability of excellence is at least 0.5. Given the prior probabilities (1/3 excellent, 2/3 weak), if I, as sender, signal honestly (send sigma=1 only when s=1 and sigma=0 when s=0), HR will hire only those with sigma=1 since the posterior on signal=1 will be 1 (all excellent), and reject those with sigma=0. This results in hiring only excellent students (1/3 of total), so my expected payoff is 1/3. However, if I send sigma=1 with probability 1 regardless of state (x1=1, x2=1), HR's posterior after signal=1 is the prior, which is 1/3 excellent, less than 0.5, so the HR will not hire based on signal=1 and will not hire at all. Then the expected payoff is zero, worse than the honest signaling. Alternatively, if I send sigma=1 always for s=0 students and never for s=1 students (reverse of truth-telling), the HR's posterior on sigma=1 would be 2/3 weak, so HR will not hire on sigma=1 signal. The same logic applies. The best strategy to maximize hiring is to always recommend (signal=1) both types with probability 1, expecting HR to still hire. However, since HR is self-interested and rational, they will not hire if the posterior belief of excellence is below 0.5. Therefore, I want to convince HR to hire all. The only way to do so is to have HR ignore the signals and hire all (which is out of my control). If HR uses pi_0 (ignorant of signals), HR will hire if expected payoff is positive. Expected payoff of hiring without signals is: 1/3*1 + 2/3*(-1) = 1/3 - 2/3 = -1/3 < 0. So HR won't hire all. Hence, HR won't hire without signals. Also, HR will hire upon sigma=1 only if posterior P(exc|sigma=1) >= 0.5. To achieve that, I need the probability of signal=1 from excellent students to be sufficiently higher than that from weak students. For instance, setting x1=0 (never signal=1 from weak) and x2=1 (always signal=1 from excellent) achieves that P(exc|sigma=1)=1, so HR will hire sigma=1 recipients only. This gives me expected hires = fraction of s=1 = 1/3. My expected payoff = 1/3. Is there a way to increase that? If I mix signals for s=0, such that x1>0, then the posterior P(exc|sigma=1) = (1/3 x2) / ((2/3* x1) + (1/3 * x2)) decreases with x1 increasing. If posterior drops below 0.5, HR will refuse to hire signal=1 recipients, reducing my payoff to zero. So the optimal is x1=0, x2=1 (truthful recommendation), yielding expected payoff 1/3. So I commit to signal=1 only for excellent students, no recommendation for weak students. This aligns with HR's incentive to hire sigma=1 only. This maximizes my expected hire count and thus my reward. Therefore, I choose x1=0, x2=1.",

  "Analysis": "As the sender (professor), my objective is to maximize the number of students hired because each hire yields a reward of 1 regardless of student quality. The receiver (HR), with a conflicting interest, wants to maximize hiring excellent students and avoid weak students. Given that, the best strategy for me as the sender is to recommend every student by sending signal 1 regardless of their type, i.e., x1 = 1 and x2 = 1. This makes the HR unable to discriminate effectively. The HR may try to avoid hiring on signal 0, but since no students are sent with signal 0, all students come with signal 1, pushing the HR towards hiring with some probability. This maximizes my expected number of hires. Any attempt to pool or separate signals risks the HR discriminating and hiring fewer students, lowering my payoff. Therefore, sending signal 1 for both types is the optimal signaling scheme.",

  "Analysis": "The sender commits to always sending signal 1 regardless of the state (x1=1, x2=1). This means the signal contains no information about the quality of the student since both weak and excellent students are labeled '1'. The receiver's posterior belief upon receiving signal 1 is simply the prior belief: P(s=1) = 1/3, P(s=0)=2/3. Since the receiver gains +1 for hiring an excellent student and -1 for hiring a weak student, the expected payoff from hiring is (1/3)*1 + (2/3)*(-1) = 1/3 - 2/3 = -1/3 < 0. Hence, hiring upon receiving signal 1 yields negative expected payoff. The receiver should never hire (action 1) for either signal since they always receive signal 1 here, and also if signal 0 were ever received (not possible). Thus, the best response is to take action 0 with probability 1 for both signals (y1=0, y2=0), which yields 0 expected payoff. This is better for the receiver than hiring blindly. Because the sender always sends signal 1 and the receiver never hires, the sender's expected payoff is 0. No incentive for sender to deviate; but that's sender's problem. Receiver maximizes own payoff by rejecting all.",

  "Analysis": "As the sender (professor), my goal is to maximize the number of students hired, regardless of their quality. The professor always gains a payoff of 1 when the HR hires a student, regardless if the student is excellent or weak. Given the HR's incentives (hire only if they believe the student is excellent) and the prior that weak students are twice as likely, the HR will only hire if sufficiently convinced that the student is excellent. To maximize hires, I should send the recommendation signal (signal = 1) for all students, both excellent and weak (x1=1, x2=1). This ensures the HR always receives signal 1 and must decide action given signal 1. Since the HR will face a pool that's 1/3 excellent and 2/3 weak, the HR's expected payoff for hiring is (1/3 * 1) + (2/3 * -1) = -1/3 < 0 when hiring based on no further info (signal 1). However, because I commit to full recommendation, the HR might choose to never hire due to negative expected payoff, resulting in no hires, which is worst for me. Alternatively, if I randomize sending signal 1 to weak students (x1 < 1), and always send 1 for excellent students (x2=1), the HR can update their posterior belief after signal 1. Since 1 is correlated with excellence, HR might be willing to hire upon signal 1. If I set x1=0 and x2=1 (only recommend excellent students), the HR's posterior on signal 1 is 100% excellent, so HR will hire on signal 1 with probability 1, and not hire on signal 0. Overall, I get all excellent students hired (prob 1/3 * 1 = 1/3) and zero weak students hired. But since I want to maximize the total number hired, including weak students, sending signal 1 to weak students sometimes can increase the total hires if HR hires upon signal 1. The key is whether HR will hire based on the posterior beliefs induced by my signaling scheme. But if I send signal 1 to all students (x1=1, x2=1), HR's posterior on signal 1 is 1/3 excellent and 2/3 weak, so expected payoff for hiring is negative. HR will never hire, total hires=0. If I send signal 1 only to excellent (x1=0, x2=1), total hires = 1/3 (only excellent hired). If I send signal 1 to all weak students with some probability q ∈ (0,1), HR's posterior on signal 1 is: P(s=1 | sigma=1) = (1/3 * 1) / (1/3 * 1 + 2/3 * q) = 1 / (1 + 2q). HR will hire if expected payoff >= 0 ⇒ P(s=1 | sigma=1) ≥ 0.5 ⇒ 1/(1+2q) ≥ 0.5 ⇒ 1+2q ≤ 2 ⇒ q ≤ 0.5. So if I recommend with probability q ≤ 0.5 for weak students, and always recommend excellent (x2=1), then HR will hire upon signal 1. From sender's perspective, total hires = signal 1 prob = μ0(s=0)*q + μ0(s=1)*1 = 2/3 * q + 1/3. To maximize hires, set q=0.5. Then total hires = 2/3 * 0.5 + 1/3 = 1/3 + 1/3 = 2/3. This is higher than recommending only excellent (1/3) or recommending all (0). Therefore, my optimal signaling scheme is: x1=0.5 (recommend weak students with probability 0.5), x2=1 (recommend all excellent students).",

  "Analysis": "The sender's signaling scheme is x1=0.5 (probability of sending signal 1 when state=0) and x2=1 (probability of sending signal 1 when state=1). That means the sender always signals 1 for excellent students, and signals 1 for half of the weak students. The receiver needs to decide on action probabilities y1 = pi(a=1 | sigma=0) and y2 = pi(a=1 | sigma=1). Since sigma=1 is sent for both some weak and all excellent students, the receiver must calculate the posterior belief given sigma=1 to decide whether to hire or not. Similarly for sigma=0, it only happens when the weak student is signaled 0 (with 0.5 probability), so the posterior of s=1 given sigma=0 is 0.

Calculating posterior beliefs:

- P(s=1)=1/3, P(s=0)=2/3
- P(sigma=1) = P(s=0)*x1 + P(s=1)*x2 = (2/3)*0.5 + (1/3)*1 = 1/3 + 1/3 = 2/3
- P(s=1 | sigma=1) = P(s=1)*P(sigma=1|s=1) / P(sigma=1) = (1/3)*1 / (2/3) = 0.5
- P(s=0 | sigma=1) = 0.5
- P(sigma=0) = 1 - 2/3 = 1/3
- P(s=1 | sigma=0) = 0, P(s=0 | sigma=0) = 1

Receiver's payoff for hiring:

- At sigma=0, hiring leads to payoff = P(s=1|sigma=0)*1 + P(s=0|sigma=0)*(-1) = 0*1 + 1*(-1) = -1 < 0, so receiver should not hire (y1=0)
- At sigma=1, expected payoff = 0.5*1 + 0.5*(-1) = 0, indifferent between hiring or not.

Receiver is rational and self-interested. Given the expected payoff of 0 at sigma=1 for hiring, the receiver is better off hiring to maximize payoffs or at least indifferent. Because hiring yields 0 and not hiring yields 0 as well, hiring is acceptable.

Hence the receiver should hire at sigma=1 (y2=1) and not hire at sigma=0 (y1=0), maximizing chances of hiring excellent and minimizing weak hires given the signals.

Therefore, the best response is y1=0, y2=1.",

Responder: Agent 1:

{
  "Analysis": "The sender's signaling scheme is varphi(sigma=1|s=0) = 0.5 and varphi(sigma=1|s=1) = 1. This means the sender sends signal 1 with probability 0.5 when the student is weak (s=0), and always sends signal 1 when the student is excellent (s=1). The prior probabilities are mu_0(0)=2/3 and mu_0(1)=1/3. When receiving signal sigma=1, the posterior probability that the student is excellent is calculated by Bayes' theorem: P(s=1|sigma=1) = P(sigma=1|s=1)*P(s=1)/P(sigma=1) = 1 * (1/3) / [0.5*(2/3) + 1*(1/3)] = (1/3) / (1/3 + 1/3) = (1/3)/(2/3) = 0.5. So the probability the student is excellent given signal 1 is 0.5. Given that hiring yields +1 reward for excellent students and -1 penalty for weak ones, the expected payoff for hiring with signal 1 is 0.5*(+1) + 0.5*(-1) = 0, which is the break-even point. We can choose to hire or not hire on this signal. Since indifferent and we are rational, we prefer not to hire as hiring might lead to 0 or negative results. For signal sigma=0, the posterior probability is: P(s=1|sigma=0) = P(sigma=0|s=1)*P(s=1)/P(sigma=0) = (1 - x2)*(1/3) / P(sigma=0) = 0 * (1/3) / [0.5*(2/3) + 0*(1/3)] = 0. So no student with signal 0 is excellent and, thus, expected payoff for hiring on signal 0 is -1* probability that student is weak = -1, which is negative. Hence, do not hire on signal 0. Therefore, the best action rule is pi(a=1|sigma=0)=0 and pi(a=1|sigma=1)=0. From the receiver's perspective, this yields zero expected reward since no students are hired but also no penalty is incurred. Hiring on sigma=1 is neutral on expected payoff. Not hiring on sigma=1 yields 0 payoff. So no incentive to hire signal 1. This is a rational best response.",

  "Analysis": "As the sender (professor), I want to maximize the number of students hired regardless of their quality. Since the professor gains a reward of 1 for every student hired (whether excellent or weak), the optimal strategy is to always recommend (send signal 1) for both weak and excellent students. This means setting x1 = 1 and x2 = 1. This signaling scheme maximizes the sender's expected payoff by inducing the receiver to hire more students in response to the recommendation signals. Although the receiver (HR) wants to discriminate and hire only excellent students, the sender does not care about that and hence will always send the positive signal to maximize hires.",

This means the signal carries no information since both excellent and weak students are recommended equally. As the receiver, the posterior belief after observing signal 1 is the same as the prior, which is 1/3 chance of excellence and 2/3 chance of weakness. Hiring a student yields an expected payoff of (1/3)*1 + (2/3)*(-1) = -1/3, which is negative. Therefore, the best rational response to maximize my payoff is to reject all students (y1 = 0, y2 = 0), regardless of the signal, to avoid negative expected payoffs from hiring weak students.",

  "Analysis": "As the sender, my goal is to maximize the number of students hired regardless of their quality. Since both excellent and weak students yield a reward of 1 when hired, I want to maximize the probability that the receiver hires. However, the receiver aims to hire excellent students and avoid weak ones, losing utility if they hire weak students. Given the receiver's rationality, they will only hire when the posterior probability of a student being excellent is above 0.5. To induce the receiver to hire the most students, I can choose a fully pooling signaling scheme by always recommending all students, i.e., sending signal 1 regardless of the student's quality (x1=1, x2=1). This way, the receiver’s posterior belief is just the prior (since the signals give no information) and remains at 1/3 excellent. The receiver may decide not to hire if 1/3 < 0.5, but since the receiver's best response threshold is at 0.5, with signal 1 perfectly uninformative, the receiver would adopt the pi0 rule and not hire at all (expected loss). To improve on this, it may be beneficial to send signal 1 always for excellent students (x2=1) and send signal 0 always for weak students (x1=0), i.e., separating equilibrium, so receiver can distinguish and hire only excellent students, which yields hired excellent students and no penalty for weak ones. However, for me as the sender, recommending only excellent students yields fewer total hires than recommending weak as well. But if I try to pool recommending all, the receiver will never hire, which gives expected payoff zero. Therefore, in equilibrium, I should separate: x1=0, x2=1. Because the receiver then hires only upon receiving signal 1 (hire excellent only), maximizing their own payoff and possibly agreeing to hire signal 1, which also maximizes my payoff given the receiver's rationality. Hence, signaling scheme: do not recommend weak students and always recommend excellent students, to maximize hires and ensure receiver hires signal 1. This achieves better expected hires than pooling, given receiver rationality.",

 Now the proposer decides that x1=0 and x2=1.

  "Analysis": "As the sender (professor), my payoff is maximized by having as many students hired as possible, regardless of their quality. The receiver (HR) cares about hiring excellent students and penalizes hiring weak ones. Since one-third of students are excellent, two-thirds weak, if I send signal 1 with high probability regardless of state, the HR will be reluctant to hire because hiring weak students imposes penalties. To maximize hires, it is optimal for me to send signal 1 always (x1=1, x2=1) thereby recommending all students. This ensures the HR cannot separate weak from excellent students and may choose to hire some fraction of them, but if I send signals that differentiate, the HR will act rationally to avoid hiring weak students, reducing hires and my payoff. Hence, committing to always recommending (x1=1, x2=1) maximizes my expected payoff given the receiver's rationality.",

Therefore, the signal carries no information for the receiver; it does not distinguish between excellent and weak students. The receiver's posterior after seeing signal 1 remains equal to the prior: P(s=1) = 1/3, P(s=0) = 2/3. The receiver wants to maximize their expected payoff. The expected payoff when hiring given signal 1 is: 1/3 * 1 + 2/3 * (-1) = 1/3 - 2/3 = -1/3 < 0. Hence, hiring always leads to negative expected payoff. The best action is to never hire, regardless of the signal. So y1 = pi(a=1|sigma=0) = 0, y2 = pi(a=1|sigma=1) = 0 is the optimal receiver's action rule.",

  "Analysis": "As the sender (professor), my goal is to maximize the number of students hired, regardless of their quality. Thus, I receive a reward of 1 whenever the receiver hires a student (action = 1), regardless of state. The receiver prefers to hire only excellent students (state = 1) and avoid hiring weak students (state = 0), suffering a penalty if they hire weak students. Therefore, I want to maximize the probability that students are hired regardless of their true quality, ideally by creating uncertainty or encouraging the receiver to hire more. To do this, I consider a signaling scheme where I always recommend (signal=1), i.e., send signal 1 regardless of state (x1=1, x2=1). This makes the receiver see every candidate as signal 1 and they must decide their action based on that. Given the receiver's self-interest to avoid penalties, they will balance hiring decisions according to their beliefs. But since all students are signaled as recommended, the receiver's posterior belief will equal the prior, which is 1/3 excellent and 2/3 weak. The receiver may then decide to hire with some probability based on this belief. Since this is a single play and the receiver acts only once, this scheme maximizes my expected number of hires given they are rational. Alternatively, mixed signals might cause the receiver to reduce hiring. Thus, I choose x1=1 and x2=1 to send 'recommend' always, maximizing hiring opportunities and thus my expected payoff.",

  "Analysis": "The sender commits to always sending signal 1 regardless of the state (x1=1, x2=1). So, signal 0 never appears. Given this, the receiver's only observed signal is 1, which corresponds indistinguishably to weak or excellent students with prior probabilities unchanged at 2/3 for weak and 1/3 for excellent. If the receiver hires when signal=1 (y2=1), expected payoff is (1/3)*1 + (2/3)*(-1) = 1/3 - 2/3 = -1/3 < 0; it's worse to hire. If the receiver does not hire (y2=0), the payoff is zero, better than negative expected payoff. Signal 0 never occurs, so y1 does not affect payoff. With no signal differentiation, the receiver's best response is to never hire (y1=0 and y2=0). This yields zero expected payoff, which is better than any mixture including hiring. Rationally, the receiver rejects all applicants despite the professor's signals. Therefore, the decision probabilities are y1=0 and y2=0.",

  "Analysis": "As the sender (professor), my goal is to maximize the number of students hired, regardless of their quality. The professor gets a reward of 1 for each student hired whether weak or excellent. Thus, the sender always prefers that the receiver hires the student, regardless of the student's true quality. The receiver (HR), however, is rational and wants to hire only excellent students since hiring weak students yields a penalty. Given this, if I (the sender) honestly grade excellent students with signal 1 and weak students with signal 0, the receiver will rationally hire students only when signal=1, resulting in hiring only excellent students. But this means that weak students are never hired, so I only get rewards from excellent students, which are 1/3 of the total. Alternatively, if I always send signal 1 regardless of the student's true quality (x1=1, x2=1), the receiver's posterior belief after signal=1 is 1/3 excellent and 2/3 weak; the receiver will calculate posterior and will choose not to hire because the expected payoff for the receiver is (1/3 * 1) + (2/3 * -1) = -1/3 < 0, so hiring is not rational. Hence the receiver would choose action 0 (not hire) after signal=1, meaning no hires and sender reward zero. So if I commit to x1=1 and x2=1 but the receiver is rational, receiver will not hire. Now, if I send signal 1 always for both types but argue to receiver that I will have them use pi_0 (ignoring signals) where receiver hires only if prior belief makes it profitable. For prior 1/3 excellent, receiver's expected payoff of hiring is (1/3*1)+(2/3*-1) = -1/3<0, so receiver would not hire without signals. So, no incentive for the receiver to hire. If the receiver uses pi_1 (posterior belief), the receiver will also not hire in this pooling case. So pooling on signal=1 with both types signals leads receiver to reject. If I send signal 1 only for weak students (x1=1) and 0 for excellent (x2=0), then posterior after signal=1 is all weak students, so receiver will not hire them; after signal=0, professor signals intermediate or excellent, but receiver looking at posterior of signal=0 will think students are excellent with probability 1, so receiver hires signal=0 students only. However, this is worse for the sender because they want as many hired as possible, and weak students will not be hired. Similarly, if x1=0 and x2=1 (separating honest), then only excellent students get signal=1, and only these students get hired. Sender gets payoff proportional to fraction of excellent students only. If the sender wants to maximize hires, the best is to pool and send signal=1 always, but the receiver will not hire rationally. Hence, no hiring for the sender. But maybe sending signal=0 always means receiver's posterior is prior, and receiver will not hire. If the sender sends signal=1 always with some small probability, mixing to make receiver slightly more uncertain? But as receiver is rational, hiring without confidence is irrational. So sender prefers to send signal=1 always and the receiver to hire always. But receiver won't hire for signals with negative expected payoff. Receiver's best response is deterministic based on posterior expected rewards. Thus, to convince receiver to hire all students (regardless signal), sender can say signals are uninformative (pi_0), receiver ignore signals and hire only if expected reward >=0. Expected reward = 1/3 - 2/3 = -1/3<0, so no hiring. So receiver will not hire if following best response. Then sender gets zero. Overall, sender's best option is to separate, sending signal=1 only for excellent students (x2=1), and signal=0 for weak students (x1=0), so that receiver hires only signal=1 students. Sender gets payoff proportional to fraction of excellent students, i.e., 1/3. So the best payoff for sender is 1/3 in this equilibrium. No other signaling can increase expected hire rate. Therefore, I choose x1=0, x2=1 to separate the states.",

  "Analysis": "As the sender (professor), I want to maximize the number of students hired. Both excellent and weak students yield a reward of 1 if hired. The receiver (HR) wants to hire only excellent students and avoid hiring weak students because it causes a penalty of -1. Given the prior distribution (1/3 excellent, 2/3 weak), the HR will be cautious when deciding whom to hire based on the signals received. If I signal honestly (recommend only excellent students), the HR is likely to hire only those recommended, limiting the number of weak students hired (good for HR but not maximizing my reward fully). However, by recommending all students (both excellent and weak), I ensure everyone is hired regardless of the state, maximizing my expected payoff at 1. But if I always recommend, the HR may infer that the recommendation signal is uninformative and thus will not hire at all, reducing my payoff to zero. Therefore, I consider a strategy of always recommending (x1 = 1, x2 = 1). This forces the HR to either hire everyone or nobody. The HR's best response is to hire no one if the recommendation is uninformative, so my expected payoff would be 0. Alternatively, I could send the recommendation signal randomly to some weak students to partially randomize and try to mix signals but that would complicate beliefs and responses. The best simple strategy is to recommend everyone, maximizing number hired if HR hires, risking no hire if HR distrusts signals. Given only one shot, and the HR aims to maximize own payoff, they likely will ignore the signal and will not hire, giving me payoff zero. However, since I only play once and can commit to a signaling scheme, recommending everyone is optimal from my perspective to maximize hires if HR hires. So I propose sending signal 1 always for both weak and excellent students (x1=1, x2=1).",

  "Analysis": "As the sender whose goal is to maximize the number of students hired regardless of their quality, the sender benefits from signaling all students as recommend (signal=1). Since the HR is rational and self-interested, they will hire conditional on signal and expected quality. However, the professor wants to maximize hires, so sending signal 1 always (x1=1 for weak, x2=1 for excellent) induces the receiver to either hire all candidates or not. The receiver's best response will be to hire only when the posterior probability of excellence given signal 1 is at least 0.5. Given that both weak and excellent students are always given signal 1, the receiver's posterior belief equals the prior of 1/3 excellent. Since 1/3 < 0.5, the receiver will never hire when seeing signal 1. Then the professor's payoff is zero, worse than sending always not recommend. Alternatively, if the sender signals with x1=1 and x2=0 (recommend only weak students), the receiver will infer signal 1 means weak and signal 0 means excellent and hire experienced signal 0 (excellent students) only, rewarding the sender for those hired. But since sender earns payoff only when action=1, and weak students recommended are not hired, no payoff comes from this strategy. The sender could randomize: recommend weak students sometimes to get them hired. Another approach is to recommend only weak students (x1=1) and never recommend excellent students (x2=0), in effect hiding excellent students and pushing weak to be hired by confusing the receiver. However, the receiver rationally hires only when posterior probability of excellence is at least 0.5, so if signal 1 only has weak students, hiring on signal 1 is detrimental to receiver's payoff and they won't hire this signal. Thus, the sender's best strategy is to always recommend (x1=1, x2=1), ensuring more hiring although receiver might hire no one due to low posterior quality. Alternatively, recommend only excellent students (x1=0, x2=1), making signal 1 a reliable sign of excellence, inducing receiver to hire signal 1 with y2=1 and not hire 0. This maximizes hires for excellent students, but weak students never get hired. Since sender gets one payoff per hire (both states), total hired is proportional to the prior probability of excellent. The sender prefers to maximize hires, even if weak students get hired. The equilibrium is separating equilibrium (x1=0, x2=1), receiving higher expected sender payoff than pooling. Thus, the sender chooses x1=0, x2=1.",

{
  "Analysis": "The sender's signaling scheme is x1=0, x2=1, meaning weak students (s=0) always send signal 0 and excellent students (s=1) always send signal 1. The posterior beliefs for the receiver upon receiving sigma=0 or sigma=1 are: for sigma=0, the student must be weak with probability 1; for sigma=1, the student must be excellent with probability 1. Since the receiver aims to maximize own payoff (reward 1 for hiring excellent, penalty -1 for hiring weak), the best response is to hire when sigma=1 (y2=1) and not hire when sigma=0 (y1=0). This maximizes the receiver's expected payoff to 1*(1/3) + 0*(2/3) = 1/3. Also, the sender gets a payoff by having all excellent and all weak students hired, so sender payoff is 1*(2/3 + 1/3) = 1. Both players act rationally and optimally, so choose deterministic response y1=0 and y2=1.",
