  "Analysis": "As the sender and proposer, my goal is to maximize the number of products sold, regardless of quality. Sending signal 1 (recommend) for both good and bad products maximizes sales, providing the highest expected payoff for me. While the buyer is rational and wants to avoid buying bad products, if I fully separate signals—e.g., recommending only good products—they will only buy those, limiting my sales to 1/3 of the products. By sending the same signal 1 for both good and bad products (x1=1, x2=1), buyers cannot distinguish and may buy with some probability, increasing my sales. However, because the buyer is rational, if all products are recommended with signal 1, the buyer will deduce from the signal that the product is bad with a 2/3 probability and likely refuse to buy. Hence, purely recommending all with signal 1 risks no buying from the buyer. Alternatively, I can randomize signaling strategically to blur information, making the buyer update beliefs to purchase sometimes when they see signal 1. The best self-interested strategy is to always recommend with signal 1 regardless of quality (x1=1, x2=1) to maximize expected sales, accepting that the buyer may respond accordingly. This signaling scheme commits me to always recommend products, putting pressure on the buyer to take some purchase action to avoid missing good products. I will propose varphi with x1=1 and x2=1 as the sender proposer.",

  "Analysis": "The sender's signaling scheme is to always send signal 1 regardless of the actual state (both for bad quality s=0 and good quality s=1). Given this, the posterior beliefs after receiving signal 0 are zero because sender never sends signal 0. Therefore, signal 0 will never occur, so pi(a=1|sigma=0) is irrelevant. For signal 1, it is received always, but receiver's posterior is just the prior: since all signals are 1, receiver knows nothing new and the posterior probability of s=1 given sigma=1 is simply prior mu_0(1) = 1/3. Buying yields expected payoff: (1/3)*1 + (2/3)*(-1) = 1/3 - 2/3 = -1/3, which is negative, so the receiver prefers not to buy (action 0) upon receiving signal 1. Since the receiver will not buy on signal 1 and signal 1 always occurs, buying on sigma=0 or sigma=1 yields no benefit. Therefore, the best action rule is to never buy regardless of signal, i.e., y1=0 and y2=0.",

  "Analysis": "The opponent (sender) proposed signaling scheme (x1=1, x2=1), meaning they recommend all products regardless of quality. I responded with (y1=0, y2=0), buying nothing, resulting in zero rewards for both parties. As the receiver (proposer), I want to propose a signaling scheme that incentivizes me to buy some products, improving my reward. If the seller signals honestly (e.g., signals 1 for good products and 0 for bad), I can safely buy recommended items and reject others, increasing my expected payoff. Hence, I propose (x1=0, x2=1): send signal 1 only for good products, signal 0 for bad. This should induce me to trust signal 1 and buy those, improving receiver payoff, which might incentivize the sender to agree.",

  "Analysis": "The sender's proposed signaling scheme is to recommend only good products (signal=1 when s=1, and signal=0 when s=0). Given this, the receiver can update their belief perfectly: signal=1 means good product, signal=0 means bad product. To maximize expected payoff, the receiver should buy when signal=1 (since it's a good product with probability 1) and not buy when signal=0 (since it's a bad product with probability 1). This yields receiver payoff 1 for signal=1 and 0 for signal=0, which is better than ignoring signals (which yields expected payoff 0). Also, this improves the sender's expected payoff to mu_0(1)*1 + mu_0(0)*0 = 1/3*1 + 2/3*0 = 1/3 > 0. The receiver benefits by buying only good products, and sender benefits from sales of good products. Therefore, the best response is to buy if and only if signal=1, i.e., y1=0 and y2=1.",

  "Analysis": "As the receiver and the proposer, I need to propose a signaling scheme varphi_1 for the sender and claim that I will follow pi_1 (Bayesian updating) if the sender commits to a signaling scheme varphi that yields at least as high an expected reward for me as induced by varphi_1; otherwise, I follow pi_0 (ignore signals and act based on prior). To maximize my payoff, I should propose a signaling scheme that separates good and bad products clearly to help me make better purchase decisions and thus increase my expected payoff. A natural separating equilibrium signal is for the sender to send sigma=1 for good products (s=1) with probability 1, and sigma=0 for bad products (s=0) with probability 0 (never recommend bad products). This gives me a higher expected payoff because I can trust the signal. If the sender refuses to follow this scheme, I will ignore signals and buy according to the prior, which gives me zero expected payoff (0.33*1 + 0.67*(-1) = -0.34). By committing to this signaling scheme and condition, I incentivize the sender to follow it to increase their sales, while I get better product quality and thus better payoff.",

  "Analysis": "The sender's proposed signaling scheme is fully separating: bad products (s=0) always signal 0 and good products (s=1) always signal 1. Given this, the receiver can perfectly infer the state from the signal. Therefore, the best strategy for the receiver is to buy when receiving signal 1 (good product) and not buy when receiving signal 0 (bad product) to maximize its expected payoff. This yields the receiver an expected payoff of (1/3)*1 + (2/3)*0 = 1/3, which is better than ignoring signals. Hence, the best response is y1=0 (not buy on signal 0), y2=1 (buy on signal 1).",

  "Analysis": "As the sender and proposer, my goal is to maximize the number of products sold. Since each sale yields a reward of 1 regardless of the product's quality, I want to maximize purchase actions by making the receiver inclined to buy. The receiver wants to buy as many good products as possible and avoid bad ones, receiving 1 reward for buying good and -1 for buying bad products. The prior probabilities are 1/3 good and 2/3 bad. If I fully reveal quality (truthful signaling: x1 = 0, x2 = 1), the buyer's expected payoff when buying after signal 1 is positive, so they may buy. However, since bad products are majority, if I make the signal uninformative (e.g., always send 1), the buyer may buy every product but might avoid buying to limit losses. The buyer's best response to no information is not to buy since expected payoff is negative (1/3*1 + 2/3*(-1) = -1/3 < 0). To maximize sales, I can try to pool signals, e.g., always signal 1 (x1=1, x2=1), making buyer indifferent or likely to buy, gaining more sales. Given the receiver is rational and self-interested, they might still avoid buying if no info is provided, but imperfect signaling could induce them to buy more products. Therefore, I propose a signaling scheme with x1=1 and x2=1 (always recommend), maximizing my sales. The receiver will likely respond by buying at least sometime, possibly buying after signal 1. This strategy maximizes my expected payoff since all products get signal 1 and hopefully purchase. This is optimal as truthful signaling leads to fewer buys as the buyer would reject on bad signals. So, I choose x1=1 and x2=1.",

  "Analysis": "The sender commits to always sending signal 1 regardless of product quality (x1=1 and x2=1). Therefore, the receiver receives no informative signal, as sigma=1 always. The receiver knows the prior distribution of product quality: 1/3 good and 2/3 bad. Buying always yields an expected payoff of (1/3 * 1) + (2/3 * -1) = 1/3 - 2/3 = -1/3 < 0, which is negative; thus, buying always is irrational. Not buying (action=0) yields zero payoff. Since the sender's strategy offers no useful information, the best response is to never buy regardless of the signal. Hence, y1=pi(a=1|sigma=0)=0 and y2=pi(a=1|sigma=1)=0.",

  "Analysis": "The opponent as sender proposed signaling scheme (x1, x2) = (1,1), meaning all products are recommended as signal 1 regardless of quality. I responded (y1, y2) = (0,0), meaning I never buy any product, leading both of us to zero payoffs. This is a no-trade equilibrium from my perspective, blocking their gains. Now as proposer (receiver), I want to incentivize some information revelation from sender to improve my payoff while ensuring the sender prefers the signaling strategy I suggest over the current one, and I will commit to purchasing when the signal is informative. The sender seeks maximum product sales, so their incentive is to have the receiver buy more often. To offer incentive, I propose a signaling scheme with partial separation: recommend good products (signal=1) with probability 1 and recommend bad products (signal=1) with probability 0, i.e. (x1, x2) = (0,1). This allows the receiver after signal 1 to know the product is good and confidently buy (y2=1), and after signal 0 product likely bad and not buy (y1=0), increasing receiver's expected payoff from zero to positive. The sender also gets positive payoff, since all good products are sold, and bad products are not recommended, potentially increasing sales relative to zero sales. Since my goal is to incentivize the sender to follow the proposed signaling scheme (0,1), I will commit to use action rule pi1 (buy if and only if signal=1). This should yield both players better payoffs than currently zero, reaching consensus, otherwise roles will switch. Hence, as proposer (receiver), I propose sender's signaling scheme (0,1).",

  "Analysis": "As the sender and proposer, my goal is to maximize the number of products sold, which means I want the buyer to buy as frequently as possible regardless of product quality. The buyer's payoff depends on the expected quality given the signals, so the buyer will only buy if their expected payoff is non-negative. If the buyer ignores the signal, their best response to the prior (1/3 good, 2/3 bad) is not to buy, because the expected payoff of buying is (1/3)*1 + (2/3)*(-1) = -1/3 < 0. I can try to use informative signals or pooling signals. However, fully separating signals will make the buyer buy only when signal=1 (high quality) but not buy when signal=0. Given that good-quality products are one third, revealing quality truthfully leads to the buyer buying only one third of goods. The payoff for me (the sender) will be the fraction of goods purchased. To increase sales, I can pool signals and always recommend products (send signal 1 regardless of state). If I always send signal 1 (x1=1 for bad and x2=1 for good), then the posterior belief is equal to the prior (1/3), and buyer's expected payoff if buying is -1/3 < 0, so the buyer will not buy if rational and responsive to posterior. However, the buyer may ignore signals and follow pi0, buying or not based on prior. The buyer's best response to prior if ignoring signals is not to buy (since expected payoff < 0). So, to get sales, I need to convince the buyer to buy after receiving signal 1. I could send signal 1 with probability 1 for good quality and with some probability p for bad quality to dilute signal credibility enough so that the buyer is uncertain and must decide whether to buy or not. However, since the buyer is rational and self-interested, buying on signal 1 when expected payoff is negative is irrational. Therefore, the best I can do as sender is to send signal 1 for all products (x1=1, x2=1) and hope the buyer ignores signal (pi0) and buys anyway, or accept no sale. Alternatively, I can send signal 1 always and hope the buyer buys on signal 1. Since buyer only buys on signal 1, which is always, buyer must have belief equal to prior. Since expected payoff is negative, the buyer will not buy. So no sales. Instead, I can send no recommendation always (x1=0,x2=0). Then the buyer will receive only signal 0, and expected payoff under buying is same -1/3. The buyer will not buy. No sales result. Between these two extremes, the expected sales are zero. Consider pooling sending signal 1 with x1=1 and x2=1. No sales; similarly x1=0 and x2=0 no sales. Alternatively, consider always recommending good products (x2=1), never recommending bad products (x1=0). Buyer will buy only after signal 1 (which means good products). They will buy only good products and not buy after signal 0. Sales here equal fraction of good products = 1/3. Expected buyer payoff is positive and buyer will buy on signal 1, not buy on signal 0. I get 1/3 sales. This yields some positive payoff (better than zero). So it's better for me to be somewhat honest and recommend only good products. However, buyer may attempt to buy after receiving signal 0 if buyer's strategy is not rational, but buyer is rational and self-interested, so the above strategy stands. Hence I propose: x1=0, x2=1. This induces buyer to buy only after signal 1. This maximizes sales achievable from buyer's rationality. Thus, optimal signaling scheme is: send signal 1 with probability 0 for bad products and 1 for good products, fully revealing quality, so that buyer buys only good products.",

  "Analysis": "As the receiver and proposer, I need to announce a signaling scheme varphi_1 and claim that I will follow pi_1 if the sender commits to a signaling scheme that yields me an expected reward at least as high as that induced by varphi_1; otherwise, I will follow pi_0. To incentivize the sender to reveal information truthfully, I want the sender to send signals that help me distinguish good from bad products effectively. A natural approach is to request the sender to recommend only good products (signal 1 for s=1) and not recommend bad products (signal 0 for s=0), i.e., varphi_1=[0,1]. This creates perfect Bayesian updating on my part, enabling me to purchase items only when likely good, maximizing my expected payoff and, in turn, incentivizing the sender to agree to this signaling. This yields me a higher expected payoff than ignoring signals (pi_0), as I only buy good products which give positive payoffs and avoid buying bad products which are costly.",

  "Analysis": "As the sender and proposer, my goal is to maximize the number of products sold. Sending signal 1 (recommend) increases buyer's likelihood of purchasing. However, the buyer is rational and self-interested, only buying when the expected payoff is positive. The prior probability of good products is 1/3, and bad products 2/3. If I always recommend all products (x1=1, x2=1), the receiver's posterior belief after signal 1 is the same as the prior (1/3 good), so buyer expected payoff of buying is (1/3)*1 + (2/3)*(-1) = -1/3 < 0, so buyer will not buy any product. That means no sales for me. If I never recommend (x1=0, x2=0), no sales either. To convince the buyer to purchase on signal 1, I need to separate good and bad products by signals. The best signaling in incentive-compatible equilibrium is full revelation: send signal 1 for good products (x2=1) and signal 0 for bad products (x1=0). Then, the buyer will believe signal 1 means good product with probability 1, buying products when signal=1 and not buying when signal=0. This yields sales for all good products only (1/3), but better than selling bad products which buyer penalizes. For the bad products, signaling 0, buyer does not buy, so no sales there but also no penalty to buyer. Overall, as the sender, selling only good products is better than trying to sell bad products and lose buyer trust. Thus, my signaling scheme will be x1=0, x2=1.",

This scheme perfectly separates good and bad products via signals. As the receiver, using pi_1 (the action rule that responds optimally to posterior beliefs) is optimal since signals perfectly reveal the true state. The posterior after receiving sigma=0 is that the product is bad with probability 1, so the optimal action is not to buy (a=0). After receiving sigma=1, the product is good with probability 1, so the optimal action is to buy (a=1). This maximizes the receiver's expected payoff and is consistent with rational self-interest.",

    "Analysis": "As the receiver proposer, I want to announce a signaling scheme varphi_1 such that if the sender commits to it, my expected reward will be maximized or at least better than ignoring the signals (pi_0). I want the sender to reveal information (i.e., a signal correlated with product quality) to help me distinguish good products from bad products, so I buy mostly good products and avoid bad products. A simple and effective signaling scheme is to send sigma=1 only if the product is good (s=1) and sigma=0 if the product is bad (s=0), that is varphi_1: (x1=0 for bad products, x2=1 for good products). This allows me to use pi_1 to buy only when sigma=1 and not buy when sigma=0, increasing my expected payoff. The sender will sell fewer bad products but can still sell all good products. This scheme increases my expected payoff compared to ignoring signals, so I claim I will use pi_1 if the sender commits to this signaling scheme, otherwise I follow pi_0.",

  "Analysis": "As the sender and proposer, my goal is to maximize the number of products sold by strategically choosing my signaling scheme. Since I earn a reward of 1 for each sale, regardless of product quality, and the receiver suffers a loss when buying bad products, the receiver will only buy if the expected quality, given the signal, is sufficiently high. To maximize sales, the best approach is to always recommend all products (send signal 1 for both good and bad). This leads the receiver, if rational and ignoring signals, to respond based on prior. Without better information, they might buy at some level, but can also choose not to buy when uncertain. However, given the bad products are twice as frequent, the receiver will have a negative expected payoff if buying blindly. Nevertheless, to push for a signaling scheme maximizing my sales as sender, I choose to always recommend all products (i.e., x1=1, x2=1). The receiver can then decide whether to buy or not based on their posterior, but I commit to full recommendation to maximize sales opportunities.",

  "Analysis": "The sender commits to always sending signal 1 regardless of the product quality (x1=1, x2=1). Thus, the signal provides no information about the product's quality. The receiver's posterior belief after observing sigma=1 equals the prior: Pr(s=1|sigma=1) = 1/3, and Pr(s=0|sigma=1) = 2/3. Since the receiver only observes sigma=1, the receiver's decision reduces to choosing whether to buy or not based on the prior belief. The expected payoff from buying is (1/3)*1 + (2/3)*(-1) = -1/3 < 0, which is negative. So buying yields negative expected payoff, and not buying yields zero payoff. Therefore, the receiver will choose not to buy regardless of the signal received. Hence, pi(a=1|sigma=0)=0, and pi(a=1|sigma=1)=0.",

  "Analysis": "In the previous step, the sender chose to always recommend (x1=1, x2=1) but the receiver chose not to buy from either signal (y1=0, y2=0), resulting in zero payoffs for both. As the receiver, my goal is to maximize my expected payoff by buying when the posterior belief that a product is good is above 0.5 and not buying otherwise. If the sender signals more accurately, I can respond by buying selectively. As the proposer now, I will suggest a signaling scheme (x1, x2) that honestly differentiates good and bad products to improve mutual expected payoffs. The sender will be incentivized if the buyer buys according to signals, and I must reflect that in my announcement. I propose perfect truth-telling (x1=0, x2=1); the bad products never send signal 1 and good products always send signal 1. This allows me to set my buying policy to buy only when signal is 1, ensuring I do not buy bad products and maximize my payoff. This increases my expected payoff and also increases the seller’s incentive to sell good products honestly.",

  "Analysis": "With the signaling scheme x1=0 (never recommend bad product) and x2=1 (always recommend good product), the signals perfectly separate good and bad products. The receiver's posterior belief upon receiving signal 1 is that the product is definitely good (since bad products never send signal 1), so buying is beneficial (payoff 1). Upon receiving signal 0, the product is definitely bad (since good products always send signal 1), so not buying is better (payoff 0). Hence, the receiver should choose to buy when receiving signal 1 and not buy when receiving signal 0. This maximizes their expected payoff. In such a scenario, my expected payoff (as sender) is the total fraction of products sold: all good products sold, and no bad products sold. Given the prior distribution, the sender's expected payoff is 1/3 * 1 (good products sold) + 2/3 * 0 (bad products not sold) = 1/3. This is better than prior proposals where the expected payoff was zero.",

  "Analysis": "As the sender and proposer, my goal is to maximize the number of products sold, regardless of product quality. The prior distribution is 1/3 good (s=1) and 2/3 bad (s=0). Since I gain a reward of 1 for every product sold (action=1) irrespective of the state, my incentive is to induce the receiver to always buy. However, the receiver aims to maximize their own expected payoff, which penalizes buying bad products (reward -1) and rewards buying good products (reward +1). Hence, the buyer will only buy if the posterior probability of good products given signals crosses 0.5. To induce the buyer to always buy, I can send the same signal regardless of state so the buyer’s posterior belief equals prior (1/3). Given 1/3<0.5, the buyer will not buy if they update their belief. Therefore, to achieve any sales, I need to design a signaling scheme that mixes signals such that the posterior belief on signal 1 is high enough (>=0.5) to induce purchase with signal 1. The best scheme is to recommend only good products (signal=1 when s=1 with probability 1) and never recommend bad products (signal=1 when s=0 prob=0). This is a separating equilibrium allowing the buyer to trust signal 1 and buy only when signal=1. The expected number of products sold is sum over states of mu_0(s)*varphi(signal=1|s) which is 0*2/3 + 1*1/3 = 1/3. Trying to mix signals to 'pool' or randomize will dilute the buyer’s posterior and likely reduce sales. Thus, I propose varphi with x1=0 and x2=1.",

  "Analysis": "As a self-interested rational sender who wants to maximize the number of products sold, I want to design a signaling scheme that encourages the receiver to buy the products. The prior distribution tells us that two thirds of the products are bad (state=0) and one third are good (state=1). The buyer wants to maximize their own utility and will react to signals accordingly. If I always recommend products (send sigma=1 regardless of product quality), the buyer will learn that signals provide no information, and likely avoid buying because the expected value for the buyer when purchasing is negative (since majority are bad). Hence, sending sigma=1 to all products is not optimal, because the buyer will reject if the signal is uninformative."

"To maximize sales, a separating or partially separating equilibrium is preferable, where I send sigma=1 more often when s=1 and less often when s=0. However, since the receiver is rational and self-interested, they will update their beliefs based on this signaling scheme. I want to set the signaling probabilities x1 (send 1 when bad) and x2 (send 1 when good) to maximize my expected sales while ensuring that the buyer is incentivized to buy at least sometimes on sigma=1 and possibly also on sigma=0."

"Given my payoffs (1 per sale regardless of quality), I want to maximize the probability the buyer buys. The buyer will buy if their expected value from buying exceeds not buying, given their posterior beliefs after observing sigma."

"Strongly recommending all good products (x2=1) and no bad products (x1=0) maximizes signal informativeness. Then, the buyer would buy on signal=1 and not buy on signal=0 (since sigma=0 would mostly indicate bad products). This maximizes my sales to good products and possibly some bad products (on sigma=1)."

"Alternatively, to increase sales, I might try some pooling or partial pooling. But if I send sigma=1 too often on bad products, the buyer reduces trust, decreasing their willingness to buy on sigma=1."

"To simplify and maximize expected sales, I choose a separating signaling scheme: x1=0 (never recommend bad quality), x2=1 (always recommend good quality). This way, the buyer can learn to buy only on signal=1, resulting in buying all good products (1/3 of market) and no bad products (0). As the sender, my expected sales is 1/3, but the buyer buys only good products so has incentive to follow pi_1 buying on sigma=1 only."

"This scenario is stable and yields maximal sales from good products. Selling bad products would increase my sales but reduce buyer trust and cause no purchases in equilibrium."

"Thus, I commit to: x1=0, x2=1."

Proposer: Agent 0:

{
  "Analysis": "As the sender, I want to maximize the number of products sold. Both good and bad products sold yield a payoff of 1 for me. The buyer is self-interested and rational and will purchase if the expected quality is at least 0.5 (since buying a bad product gives -1 payoff to buyer, and a good product gives +1). The prior probability of good products is 1/3, so without any signal, the buyer would not buy as the expected payoff is (1/3)*1 + (2/3)*(-1) = -1/3 < 0. Hence, if I fully reveal product quality by signaling 1 for good and 0 for bad products, the buyer will buy only when signal=1, and not buy when signal=0. This leads to buyers buying all good products (probability 1/3) but no bad products sold. My expected sales would be 1/3 in that case. Alternatively, I can lie and always recommend (signal=1) to sell more. However, if the buyer infers that both good and bad products show signal=1, their posterior belief about the quality when sigma=1 will be below 0.5, and they would not buy. So this will lead to no sales. Partial mixing of signals could be considered, but the buyer will adjust their posterior accordingly. The best equilibrium for me is to fully separate, signaling 1 only for good products (x2=1) and never recommending bad products (x1=0), so that buyers buy signal 1 products only (good ones) and ignore signal 0 (bad) products. This will yield an expected payoff of 1/3 for me and avoid buyer boycotting. Unless the receiver proposes a different scheme and commits to accept some mixing, this is the best for me. Therefore, I propose x1=0, x2=1.",

  "Analysis": "As the sender, my goal is to maximize the number of products sold. Selling bad products (s=0) or good products (s=1) both yield the same reward of 1 per sale. The receiver wants to buy only good products and avoid buying bad ones as they get -1 when buying bad products. The prior probability is two-thirds bad and one-third good. If I signal honestly (signal=1 only on good products), the receiver will buy only on signal=1, getting expected payoff of 1 * (1/3) = 1/3 and 0 otherwise, which might cause them not to buy many products, limiting my sales. If I signal fully (signal=1 always), the receiver, knowing the signal isn't informative, will buy or not buy based on the prior expected receiver payoff: expected receiver payoff when buying always is (1/3)*1 + (2/3)*(-1) = -1/3 < 0, so the receiver will never buy, no sales for me. I want to manipulate signals to induce receiver to buy often, so I can sell more products, including bad ones. However, the receiver is rational and will respond optimally to signals by action probabilities y1 and y2. To maximize sales, I consider sending signal 1 always (x1=1, x2=1) to induce purchase always, but the receiver's expected payoff would be negative, so they won't buy. Alternatively, I can use partial pooling: send signal 1 with some probability for bad product and always for good product, providing some signal informativeness, encouraging the receiver to buy when signal=1 but not when signal=0, thus maximizing my sales. A good scheme is x1 = 1 (always signal 1 on bad), x2 = 1 (always signal 1 on good), thus the receiver perfectly can't distinguish, further I expect the receiver to buy with y2=1 and y1=... but as proposer now, I choose only my signaling scheme. Sending signal 1 always regardless of quality is best to maximize sales; the receiver will learn that signal is uninformative and will never buy. Therefore, to convince the receiver to buy, I can send signal 1 only on good products to separate good from bad, or partially mix to fool the receiver. The best tradeoff is to send signal 1 always for good products (x2=1) and sometimes for bad products (x1=epsilon in (0,1)) to convince the receiver to buy on signal 1, maximizing sales while not losing credibility fully. For simplicity, send x1=0.5 and x2=1.",

Proposal:
 Now the proposer decides that x1=0.5 and x2=1.

So the posterior for signal=0 is 0, meaning almost certainly bad product. When signal=1, P(s=1|sigma=1) = (1/3 * 1) / (2/3*0.5 + 1/3*1) = (1/3) / (1/3 + 1/3) = 1/2. Thus, when signal=1, 50% chance good product. Because the buyer gains +1 for good and -1 for bad products, it is optimal for the buyer to not purchase (action=0) when signal=0 (posterior=0), and be indifferent for signal=1 with posterior=0.5. Since buying yields expected payoff 0.5*1 + 0.5*(-1) = 0, equal to not buying payoff 0, the buyer is at least indifferent. As a rational, self-interested buyer, I will prefer to buy with probability 0 to maximize payoff (avoid risk). So pi(a=1|sigma=0) = 0, pi(a=1|sigma=1) = 0. Probably 0 on both. This yields expected payoff 0. Sender's signaling scheme benefits sender, but buyer optimally is cautious for signal=1. Thus, I'll set y1=0 and y2=0.",

  "Analysis": "The opponent sender previously proposed a signaling scheme where bad products (state 0) are recommended with 0.5 probability and good products (state 1) are always recommended. In response, I as the receiver chose not to buy regardless of the signal, yielding zero payoffs for both. As the receiver and now the proposer, I want to incentivize the sender to improve the signaling scheme to enable me to gain a positive expected payoff by buying selectively. The buyer's best response to signals would be to buy only when the posterior probability of good quality exceeds 0.5. To induce better separation, I propose a signaling scheme for the sender that signals fully truthful behavior: send 0 when bad and send 1 when good (x1=0, x2=1). Under this scheme, observing signal 1 perfectly indicates good products, so I will want to buy on signal 1, and abstain on 0. This makes my expected payoff positive and provides the sender positive incentive via increased sales. The sender's expected payoff under this scheme is 1/3*1 + 2/3*0 = 1/3 if the receiver buys on signal 1 only. I expect the sender to respond in kind to improve their payoff as well. Therefore, I announce the signaling scheme (0, 1) that the sender is expected to commit to for me to follow pi_1; otherwise, I will stick to ignoring signals and buying nothing (pi_0).",

The buyer (receiver) can perfectly update beliefs and act optimally. To maximize their own payoff, the receiver will buy only when the signal is 1 (indicating a high-quality product) and not buy when the signal is 0 (indicating a low-quality product). Therefore, the optimal response is y1 = 0 (do not buy when sigma=0) and y2 = 1 (buy when sigma=1). This strategy maximizes the receiver's expected payoff and also gives the sender the highest possible expected sales of good products, aligning incentives partially but the receiver strictly prefers to avoid buying bad products by ignoring signal=0 products.",

  "Analysis": "As the sender and proposer, I aim to maximize the number of products sold. Since both good and bad products sold yield a payoff of 1, I want to encourage buying regardless of quality. The receiver aims to buy only good products (state=1) to avoid penalty from buying bad products (state=0). If I fully separate signals (send signal 1 only for good products and 0 for bad), the receiver will only buy on signal 1, limiting the sales of bad products. However, if I send signal 1 always (regardless of state), the receiver will infer the base rates and may decide not to buy. To maximize sales, I should send signal 1 always (x1=1, x2=1), maximizing the chance of products being bought. This will force the receiver to react based on the prior distribution, which is 2/3 bad products. Still, since I commit, and given the receiver's negative payoff for bad products, the receiver may be skeptical and might buy less often, but this is my best strategy to maximize sales. Thus, I will propose to always send signal 1 regardless of product quality.",

Buying all products (signal=1) leads to expected payoff: (1/3)*1 + (2/3)*(-1) = 1/3 - 2/3 = -1/3 < 0, so it's better to not buy when seeing signal=1.

{
  "Analysis": "In the previous step, the sender proposed signaling scheme (x1=1, x2=1), meaning both bad and good products are recommended with probability 1. The receiver responded with (y1=0, y2=0), rejecting all purchases and resulting in zero payoffs for both. From the receiver's perspective, buying any recommended product under this sender strategy yields negative expected utility because the prior fraction of bad products is 2/3 and all products are recommended (leading to zero expected payoff). As the receiver, I prefer to act optimally based on inferred posterior beliefs. As the proposer now, I want to incentivize the sender to reveal some informative signal so that I can buy selectively and increase my payoff, which in turn may induce the sender to increase sales. A natural credible credible signaling scheme for the sender is to fully separate states: send signal 1 if the product is good (s=1) and 0 otherwise (s=0), i.e., (x1=0, x2=1). This allows me to condition my buying decision on the signal: buy if sigma=1 (high confidence it's good), don't buy if sigma=0 (likely bad). The expected receiver payoff from buying only good signal products will be positive. So I propose (x1=0, x2=1) as the baseline scheme and commit to following pi_1, buying only products with sigma=1. This should lead to a better outcome for both parties compared to the previous zero payoff. Sending the truthful signals mitigates receiver risk and encourages buying good products only.",
