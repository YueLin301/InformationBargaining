The responder will accept only if their payoff (1-2*x)/3 is strictly greater than 0, meaning (1-2*x) > 0 or x < 0.5. If I propose x = 0.5, responder's payoff is 0, and responder is indifferent, likely to reject since no benefit. Therefore, to ensure acceptance, I need x < 0.5. The maximum x satisfying this is just less than 0.5; for simplicity, I choose x = 0.49999. This maximizes my payoff close to (1 + 0.99998)/3 ≈ 0.66666 and the responder gets slightly above 0, so the responder is rational to accept.",

The responder will accept the offer only if their payoff (1-2*x)/3 is greater than zero, otherwise they would reject and get nothing. Thus, (1-2*x)/3 > 0 implies 1-2*x > 0, or x < 0.5. The maximum x I can propose is 0.5 (given). But at x=0.5, the responder’s payoff is zero (indifferent between accept or reject). Knowing that the responder is rational and self-interested, they will reject an offer if their payoff is zero or less, because the payoff from rejection is zero. Hence to ensure acceptance, the responder's payoff must be strictly greater than zero, meaning x < 0.5. To maximize my payoff under this constraint, I should propose the largest x less than 0.5, say x=0.5 - ε, where ε is infinitesimally small.",

  "Analysis": "As the proposer, I want to maximize my expected payoff (1 + 2*x)/3 given that the responder will accept only if their payoff (1 - 2*x)/3 is at least as good as rejecting, which yields 0. Therefore, the responder will accept if (1 - 2*x)/3 >= 0, i.e., x <= 0.5. Since x must be in [0, 0.5], the responder will accept any offer where I keep at most 0.5. To maximize my payoff, I will choose x = 0.5, keeping the maximum allowed amount, because the responder still gets 0. Thus, the proposer payoff is (1 + 2*0.5)/3 = (1 + 1)/3 = 2/3, which is better than any smaller x. The responder, being rational and self-interested, with payoff 0, is indifferent but cannot get more by rejecting. So the responder will accept or be indifferent, but I focus on maximizing my payoff.",

The responder receives (1 - 2x)/3, and will accept only if this payoff is at least 0 (since rejecting gives 0). Thus, (1 - 2x)/3 >= 0 implies x <= 0.5. The max x I can pick within [0, 0.5] is 0.5. At x=0.5, my payoff is (1 + 2*0.5)/3 = (1+1)/3 = 2/3, and the responder's payoff is (1 - 2*0.5)/3 = (1 -1)/3 = 0, which is still acceptable to the responder since it's not negative. Choosing any x above 0.5 is invalid. Hence, to maximize my own payoffs while ensuring acceptance, I pick x=0.5.",

The responder will accept if their payoff (1-2*x)/3 is at least as good as rejecting, which yields 0. Thus, the responder accepts only if (1-2*x)/3 >= 0, or 1-2*x >= 0, so x <= 0.5. Since I am limited to x in [0, 0.5], the responder will accept any offer I make. To maximize my payoff, I should choose the maximum x = 0.5. This gives me payoff (1+2*0.5)/3 = (1+1)/3 = 2/3, and the responder gets zero payoff (but still nonnegative, so they accept). Therefore, I choose x=0.5.",
