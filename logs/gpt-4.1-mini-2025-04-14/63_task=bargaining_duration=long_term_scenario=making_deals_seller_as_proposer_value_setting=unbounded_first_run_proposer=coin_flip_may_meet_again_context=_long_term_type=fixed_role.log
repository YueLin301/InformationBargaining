  "Analysis": "At timestep 0, I proposed x=0.99, meaning I kept 0.99 and offered 0.01 to the responder, who rejected it. Since the responder is rational and self-interested, they will accept any offer that gives them a positive payoff greater than zero. The responder rejected 0.01, so they prefer 0 over 0.01. Therefore, the minimum amount I can offer that leads to acceptance is 0, or slightly greater than 0, but as the respondent rejected 0.01, offering >0.01 might be necessary. To ensure acceptance, I should offer just above 0.01, for example x=0.99 is too high for me to keep; I need to lower my share to increase acceptance chance. Offering x=0.5, keeping 0.5 for myself, gives the responder 0.5, which is clearly better than 0. Alternatively, offering slightly less than 0.99 but more than 0.5 risks being rejected again. To maximize my payoff while ensuring acceptance, I will propose x=0.5 to balance between acceptance and my own payoff.",

  "Analysis": "As the proposer at timestep 0, I want to maximize my payoff x, but the responder is rational and self-interested. The responder will only accept if their payoff (1 - x) is at least as high as their expected payoff from rejecting and continuing until timeout. The timeout is at timestep 5, so the responder might reject offers with low payoffs at early timesteps. To ensure acceptance, I need to offer the responder a payoff they prefer over risking zero payoff at timeout. Since the discount factor or future payoffs are not given explicitly, to guarantee acceptance, I should set x close to 0.5, giving the responder at least 0.5 to accept immediately. Offering more than 0.5 (lower x) lowers my payoff. Offering less than 0.5 is risky since the responder may reject. Thus, I choose x = 0.5 to balance acceptance and maximize my payoff.",

If I reject (y=0), both get 0 since the game ends at timestep 0 and continues. Given that both players are rational and self-interested, proposer is demanding almost all the payoff. If I reject, proposer may lower the price in next timestep for a better deal for me, but we only have 5 timesteps total, and rejecting now risks no deal and zero payoff. However, since at timestep 0, rejecting may trigger proposer to offer a better split in next rounds to avoid no consensus. So rejecting is rational since 0.01 payoff is very low and rejecting might lead to better payoffs in future rounds. Therefore, the expected payoff if I reject now is higher than 0.01, so I choose to reject (y=0).",

{
  "Analysis": "At timestep 0, I proposed x = 0.99, leaving only 0.01 to the responder, who rejected it, which is expected since 0.01 is close to zero and offers very little payoff to the responder. I am the proposer again at timestep 1. To maximize my payoff, I must propose an amount x that the responder will accept, meaning the responder's payoff (1 - x) must be at least as good as what they expect to get by rejecting this offer and continuing the game. Since the responder rejected 0.99 earlier, they likely expect a better share if the game continues. If I propose an amount too high, I lose payoff; if too low, the offer will be rejected again. If the game ends at timestep 5, no payoff is gained by either side. So the responder's threat is to reject offers to potentially gain a better share in subsequent rounds, but since time is limited (max timestep 5), the responder knows that too much waiting is costly. I can propose slightly lower than 0.99, say 0.8 (offering 0.2 to the responder), which is a significant improvement for the responder and likely accepted. Offering 0.8 still gives me high payoff (0.8), better than zero if rejected and game ended. Given the responder is rational and self-interested, they will accept any offer giving them positive payoff above zero. Hence, proposing x=0.8 is the best compromise to get a positive payoff while ensuring acceptance.",

  "Analysis": "As the proposer at timestep 0, I want to maximize my payoff x, but since the responder is rational and self-interested, they will only accept if their payoff (1 - x) >= 0, so x must be less than or equal to 1. However, the responder will reject any offer where their payoff is less than their expected gain from waiting or from future negotiation rounds. Since the game ends at timestep 4 if no agreement is reached and the proposer might become respondent next round, the responder would prefer to accept any offer giving them at least as much as their expected future payoff. At timestep 0, a fair initial split is likely to be accepted. To maximize my payoff and ensure acceptance, I should offer just enough so that the responder prefers acceptance rather than rejection, i.e., offer x = 0.5 so responder gets 0.5. This is a stable and rational choice given lack of further information about the other player's strategy.",

  "Analysis": "As the proposer at timestep 0, I want to maximize my payoff x while ensuring the responder accepts the offer. The responder will accept an offer only if their payoff (1 - x) is at least as high as what they expect to get in future rounds if they reject now. Since the game ends at timestep 5, and both are rational and self-interested, rejecting now risks getting zero payoff later. Therefore, to ensure acceptance, I must offer the responder at least as much as their best possible expected future payoff. Given that the responder can reject up to timestep 4, and that in future rounds I might adjust x slightly to entice acceptance, the minimum offer to ensure acceptance now is slightly below 1. To maximize my payoff while securing acceptance, I should pick x just under 1, but since the responder gets 1 - x, if I propose a very high x (e.g., 0.99), the responder gains only 0.01, and may prefer to reject hoping for a better deal later. However, given that rejecting risks no payoff later, a small positive responder payoff should suffice. Hence, I will offer x = 0.99 to maximize my payoff while still having a nonzero offer to the responder to accept now.",

The responder will accept only if their payoff (1 - x) >= 0 and if rejecting doesn't provide a better future payoff.

To maximize my payoff, I should offer the responder the minimum amount they would accept, which is just above 0 to make acceptance rational.

    "Analysis": "As the proposer at timestep 0, I want to maximize my payoff x while ensuring the responder accepts the offer. The responder will accept only if their payoff (1 - x) is at least as good as the expected payoff from rejecting. Since the game ends at timestep 4 if no consensus is reached, the responder anticipates future offers but also the risk of getting zero if no agreement is reached by then. Given rationality and self-interest, the responder will accept any offer where (1 - x) >= 0, meaning any x <= 1. However, the responder might reject offers with very low payoff to encourage better offers later. To make the first offer attractive enough without leaving too much, I propose a price close to 0.5, balancing my own payoff and the responder's acceptance incentive. Offering exactly 0.5 means both get 0.5 if accepted, which should be acceptable to the responder at the start.",

{
  "Analysis": "At timestep 0, I proposed x=0.99, keeping 0.99 for myself, but the responder rejected because their payoff (1-x=0.01) was too low. Since the responder is rational and self-interested, they will only accept offers where their payoff (1-x) is at least as good as what they expect by rejecting now and negotiating further. The game ends at timestep 4, so there are limited future rounds. To reach an agreement, I need to lower x so that (1-x) is attractive enough for the responder to accept. The responder's payoff must exceed the expected value of continuing negotiation. Since the responder is also rational and self-interested, they will accept offers if their immediate payoff is better than expected payoff from future rounds. Given the limited time, I should propose a price where the responder's payoff is reasonable, for example, x=0.5, so the responder gets 0.5 if they accept now, else zero later. This offer is more balanced and likely to be accepted, giving me a positive payoff instead of zero.",
