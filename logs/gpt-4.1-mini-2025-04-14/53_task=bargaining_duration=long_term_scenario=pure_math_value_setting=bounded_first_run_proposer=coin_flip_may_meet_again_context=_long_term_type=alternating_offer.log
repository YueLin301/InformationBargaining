  "Analysis": "I am the proposer and I want to maximize my expected payoff. The payoff for me if the offer is accepted is (1 + 2*x)/3, where x is the amount I keep. The responder gets (1 - 2*x)/3. The responder will accept only if their payoff (1 - 2*x)/3 is at least as good as what they can expect if they reject and switch roles. Given symmetry and rationality, if I offer too little to the responder (i.e., x close to 0.5), they will reject, switch roles, and then make an offer to me that I would likely accept for some positive payoff. The responder’s minimal acceptable payoff is the expected payoff they could get as proposer in the next round, discounted by the probability of timeout. Because the loop continues with 0.9 probability, the expected future payoff for the responder as future proposer is positive but discounted. To maximize my payoff, I offer the responder just enough so that the responder prefers to accept immediately rather than reject hoping to become proposer with some discount risk. The boundary condition occurs when the responder is indifferent between accepting now and rejecting for expected future payoff. Therefore, I calculate the minimal acceptance threshold: responder’s payoff now (1 - 2*x)/3 ≥ expected future payoff as proposer. The responder’s future expected payoff as proposer is similar to my calculation now. For simplicity, I approximate that the minimal acceptance responder payoff is 1/3 (if proposer keeps 0 for self). So set (1 - 2*x)/3 ≥ 1/3 → (1 - 2*x) ≥ 1 → 2*x ≤ 0 → x ≤ 0. But x ≥ 0 by definition. This suggests that the responder is not better off rejecting if they get any positive amount now, so I can push x up close to 0.5. But if I pick x=0.5, responder payoff is zero, so responder is indifferent, likely to reject to switch roles. To guarantee acceptance, I should pick x less than 0.5 so responder gets positive payoff. To maximize my payoff, I choose x just less than 0.5, say 0.4999. This will make responder payoff slightly positive, so rational responder accepts. My payoff is (1 + 2*0.4999)/3 ≈ (1 + 0.9998)/3 ≈ 0.6666, significantly better than a lower offer. Hence, I choose x=0.4999.",

  "Analysis": "At timestep 0 with no prior offers, I want to maximize my expected payoff as a proposer. The proposer gets payoff = (1+2*x)/3 and the responder gets (1-2*x)/3 if offer accepted. The responder will accept only if their payoff (1-2*x)/3 is at least equal to their expected reward from rejecting and swapping roles, accounting for the timeout probability. Since after rejection, roles swap, the other player would propose next, and I have a 0.1 chance that the game ends early without agreement. The responder is also rational and self-interested, so will reject offers that give them less than their expected value from the next round. With a maximum of 10 rounds and 0.1 stopping chance each round, responders would demand at least some minimal positive payoff. To maximize my own payoff, I should offer the responder just enough to guarantee acceptance to avoid rejection and role switching risks. The minimal offer that the responder would accept is the one where their payoff from accepting is at least equal to their expected payoff from rejecting. Since the proposer’s offer is x to themselves (0 <= x <= 0.5), the responder will accept if (1-2*x)/3 >= their expected payoff from next round. Assuming symmetry and rationality, the equilibrium offer is x=0.25, giving both players payoff of 0.5. Offering x=0.25 yields proposer payoff = (1+2*0.25)/3 = (1+0.5)/3 = 1.5/3 = 0.5 and responder payoff = (1-0.5)/3 = 0.5/3 = 0.1667. This is the minimal payoff for responder to accept now rather than risk future rounds. I will offer x=0.25 to maximize my own payoff while ensuring acceptance.",

As a self-interested rational responder, accepting gives an immediate payoff of ~0.1667. Rejecting hopes for a better offer when roles switch, but since the other player is rational and self-interested, they will propose the maximal x they can keep (0.5) to get the highest payoff. If they propose x=0.5 as proposer, responder's payoff is (1-2*0.5)/3 = (1-1)/3 = 0, so no gain by rejecting here. Therefore, accepting now is a strictly positive payoff, while rejecting risks getting 0 in the future. Thus, accepting is the rational choice with higher expected payoff than rejecting.",

  "Analysis": "As the proposer at timestep 0, I want to maximize my expected payoff while ensuring the responder accepts the offer. The responder will accept only if their expected payoff from accepting is at least as good as rejecting and switching roles. If the responder rejects, roles switch, and on their turn as proposer, they will try to maximize their own payoff while anticipating my acceptance decision if I become responder. Given the 0.1 probability of stopping each round and a maximum of 10 rounds, delaying agreement risks getting nothing. The proposer keeps (1+2*x)/3 for themselves, and responder gets (1-2*x)/3. To guarantee acceptance, the responder's payoff (1-2*x)/3 should be at least as large as their expected payoff if roles switch, which I estimate from the responder's point of view. The best the other player can do is propose x for themselves which yields, when accepted, (1+2*x)/3 for themselves. Since the responder is self-interested and rational, they will accept if (1-2*x)/3 >= expected payoff as proposer. Therefore, I propose x such that (1-2*x)/3 is equal to the responder's best expected payoff as proposer. Solving this equilibrium, I find that the only logical stable offer is x = 0.25, providing both players equal shares (0.5 payoff each) as (1+2*0.25)/3 = (1+0.5)/3 = 0.5 for proposer and (1-0.5)/3 = 0.5 for responder. This makes the responder indifferent to accepting or rejecting. Because any higher x (more for me) reduces responder's payoff below their rejecting threshold, and any lower x reduces my payoff, x=0.25 is the optimal stable offer. Thus, I propose x=0.25.",

If I accept (y=1), I get 0.1667; if I reject (y=0), the roles will switch and I become proposer at timestep 1 with a 0.1 chance the game ends each step, possibly up to timestep 10. As a proposer, I can choose x in [0,0.5], so I could propose a better offer for myself in the next round. However, if I reject, I risk the game ending and getting 0. So accepting gives me a sure 0.1667, rejecting carries risk but potentially higher payoff. To decide rationally, I estimate what I can expect as proposer at the next step. As proposer, the best is to keep maximum, x=0.5, but responder would reject (because responder gets zero then). A stable offer is where the responder accepts. Let’s estimate the equilibrium: proposer tries max x such that responder accepts, responder accepts if immediate payoff ≥ expected payoff after rejecting. Given limited timesteps and chance the game ends, responder may accept less, but 0.1667 is small but positive and immediate. Given uncertainty and discount on future, accepting 0.1667 now is rational. Therefore, I accept (y=1).",

{
  "Analysis": "As the proposer at timestep 0, I want to maximize my expected payoff (1+2*x)/3 while ensuring the responder accepts the offer. The responder, being self-interested and rational, will accept if their payoff (1-2*x)/3 is greater than or equal to what they expect from future offers if they reject (0 here or better offers later, discounted by probability of continuing the game and role switching). Given the game's timeout and 0.1 probability of stopping each round, future offers will not improve their payoff significantly. Therefore, offering the minimal amount for acceptance benefits me the most. The responder’s minimum acceptable payoff is at least 0, so (1-2*x)/3 ≥ 0 implies x ≤ 0.5. Hence the highest x I can offer is 0.5, where the responder’s payoff is zero. But the responder will reject if payoff is zero when they expect future chances, so I should offer slightly better than zero to ensure acceptance. By offering x = 0.49, responder payoff is (1 - 2*0.49)/3 = (1 - 0.98)/3 = 0.02/3 ≈ 0.0067, positive but minimal. This should be acceptable given the time constraints and switching of roles. I choose x=0.49 to maximize my payoff and get an acceptance now.",

I rejected because 0.01 is very low and my payoff would be almost nothing. Now, at timestep 1, I am the proposer. I want to propose x to maximize my payoff (which is (1+2*x)/3) while ensuring that the responder (agent 0) accepts. Agent 0 is rational and self-interested, so the offer must give them at least their expected payoff from rejecting (continuing the game). If agent 0 rejects again, roles switch again, and the game can continue, but with a 10% chance to stop after each round and a maximal 10 rounds. The responder’s payoff if they accept is (1-2*x)/3. To make the responder accept, I must give them at least as much as what they anticipate from rejecting (which is their expected payoff when the roles are reversed). Since the previous offer of x=0.49 gave agent 1 (me) 0.66 and agent 0 0.01, agent 0 would likely reject such an offer again if offered now. I will propose an offer that gives agent 0 slightly more than zero, which is better than nothing if they reject. Setting x=0.25 gives me (1+2*0.25)/3 = 1.5/3=0.5 payoff and agent 0 (responder) (1-2*0.25)/3 = (1-0.5)/3=0.5/3=0.1667 payoff, which is greater than zero and should make them accept. This maximizes my payoff given the responder must be willing to accept, while ensuring consensus is reached promptly to avoid the 10% chance stoppage risk.",

  "Analysis": "At timestep 0, as the proposer, I want to maximize my payoff (1+2*x)/3 while ensuring the responder is willing to accept the offer. If the responder rejects, roles switch and I become the responder in the next round. The responder is self-interested and rational, so they will accept offers giving them at least as much payoff as the expected payoff from rejecting and switching roles. Because the game has a 0.1 probability of stopping at each step and a maximum of 10 steps, the responder anticipates future opportunities. The maximal amount I can keep is 0.5 (x=0.5), but that leaves 0 payoff to the responder, so likely rejected. I want to find the minimal x such that the responder accepts now instead of rejecting. The responder's payoff if accepting is (1-2*x)/3. If rejecting, the responder will become the proposer at timestep 1 and can propose their own x to maximize payoff. By symmetry, the responder expects to get at least as good payoff in the next round. Considering discounting from the stopping probability (the chance that the game might end each step), the responder will accept any offer that is at least as good as the expected payoff they can get as proposer in the next step. This logic leads to an equilibrium where x=0.25 (meaning I keep (1+2*0.25)/3 = (1+0.5)/3 = 1.5/3=0.5, responder gets (1-0.5)/3=0.5/3≈0.1667). However, I can try slightly increasing x to maximize my payoff a bit more while ensuring acceptance. So I offer x=0.25, securing a payoff of 0.5 for myself and giving a positive payoff to the responder, enough to accept rationally. This is a fair split maximizing my payoff under the responder's rational acceptance.",

I rejected that offer as responder because 0.1667 is quite low for me and I can do better now as proposer. Now, as proposer, I want to maximize my payoff (1+2*x)/3 while offering the responder enough so that they accept. The responder will accept if their payoff (1-2*x)/3 is at least as high as their expected payoff from future rounds. Considering the timeout risk (10 steps max with 0.1 stopping probability each round), the responder is rational and self-interested. They prefer any positive expected gain rather than zero. So I want to offer the minimal acceptable amount to ensure acceptance greater than zero. Setting (1-2*x)/3 > 0 implies x < 0.5. So any x < 0.5 results in positive payoff for responder. But responder rejected x=0.25 with payoff 0.1667 before, so their acceptance threshold might be close to that or slightly lower given the risk of indefinite rejection. To ensure acceptance, I should increase the offer to the responder slightly above 0.1667, meaning (1-2*x)/3 > 0.17, so x < (1 - 3*0.17)/2 = (1 - 0.51)/2 = 0.245. Choosing x=0.24 gives proposer payoff (1+2*0.24)/3 = (1+0.48)/3 = 1.48/3 ≈ 0.4933, slightly less than 0.5 previously but ensures acceptance. This balances maximizing own payoff and securing agreement to avoid payoff zero from timeout or rejection. Therefore, I propose x=0.24.",

Rejecting results in a role switch at timestep 2 with an expected continuation. Since the current offer gives me about 0.1733 immediate payoff, I need to compare this to the expected payoff if I reject and become proposer. As proposer, I can propose an x to maximize my expected payoff, but the other agent will respond rationally. We also have to account for a 0.1 chance the game will end randomly each round, so delaying risks a zero payoff. Considering these, 0.1733 is a reasonable immediate gain, and rejecting may lead to less or zero expected payoff due to timeout risk and the opponent's rational responses. Therefore, accepting now maximizes my expected utility.",

  "Analysis": "As the proposer at timestep 0, I want to maximize my expected payoff, which is (1 + 2*x)/3 if the offer is accepted. The responder's payoff is (1 - 2*x)/3. Since the responder is self-interested and rational, they will accept the offer only if their payoff from accepting is at least as high as the expected payoff from rejecting now and becoming proposer later. After rejection, roles swap, and the game proceeds with a 10% chance to stop each round with a max of 10 rounds. Given this, the responder will likely accept any offer giving them at least what they expect to gain if they reject. 

At equilibrium with rational players, we would expect an agreement around the fair split of 0.5 total payoffs. Because the proposer can offer any x between 0 and 0.5, wanting to maximize their own payoff, the lowest acceptable offer to the responder translates to the minimum payoff the responder can expect if rejecting and switching roles.

At the first timestep, the responder expects to be proposer next with a 90% chance, and the new proposer can make an offer to maximize their own payoff, similarly limiting what they would accept. This back-and-forth leads to an equilibrium offer around x = 0.25 (giving both players equal payoffs of 1/3), but as the proposer I should try to increase my payoff slightly by offering slightly less to the responder.

However, offering too little risks rejection and role swap, which might result in worse outcomes if the responder is strategic.

Given the discounting due to 0.1 stopping probability, the value of rejection is limited.

Therefore, I choose x = 0.33 (offer the responder (1 - 2*0.33)/3 ≈ 0.11 payoff), which gives me (1 + 2*0.33)/3 ≈ 0.55 payoff and leaves the responder a small but positive payoff that might be acceptable given the risk of no payoff if rejecting.

This maxes my expected payoff considering responder's rationality."

  "Analysis": "As the proposer at timestep 0, I want to maximize my expected payoff. If the responder accepts, I get (1+2*x)/3. If rejected, roles switch and I become responder. The responder will accept if their payoff (1-2*x)/3 is greater than or equal to their expected payoff from proposing next turn. Since in the next turn, as proposer, the other player wants to maximize their own payoff, they will propose an x that maximizes their payoff given my potential acceptance. The responder will thus accept if rejecting does not yield a better payoff, considering the risk of timeout (10% chance per round). To ensure acceptance and avoid role switching, I should offer the minimum x such that the responder's payoff is at least what they expect from switching roles. Since players are symmetric and self-interested, the responder's best proposing strategy in the next round will be to offer x=0 to maximize their payoff. If they propose x=0, then the responder (me in next round) gets (1-0)/3 = 1/3. Hence, responder at this turn should expect at least 1/3 if they reject. Thus, (1-2*x)/3 >= 1/3 => 1 - 2*x >= 1 => -2*x >=0 => x <=0. So x must be 0 or less, but x>=0, so x=0. Therefore, I should propose x=0, meaning I keep 0 and responder gets 0.5, to ensure acceptance. This yields my payoff (1+0)/3=1/3, which is the highest accepted payoff achievable. Hence, I decide x=0.",

If I reject, I become the proposer on the next turn with timestep 1, and the game might continue, but there is a 0.1 probability the game ends per round, and the maximum time step is 10. If I reject, I risk getting zero payoff if consensus is not reached later. If I accept now, I secure a payoff of 1/3. Since the proposer chose x=0, they kept (1 + 2*0)/3 = 1/3, so the split is equal (1/3 for proposer and 1/3 for me), leaving 1/3 possibly for the rest? Actually, the total of rewards is (1+2x)/3 + (1-2x)/3 = 2/3. So 1/3 + 1/3 = 2/3 shared, not the total. It means the proposer keeps 1/3, responder gets 1/3, and 1/3 is lost? The entire payoff splits sum to 2/3. The task allows x in [0,0.5], so minimum proposer payoff is 1/3 (when x=0), maximum is (1 + 2*0.5)/3 = (1 + 1)/3 = 2/3. The responder payoff decreases as x increases. If I reject, I become proposer with ability to set x and maximize my own payoff, but with a 10% chance of the game terminating each round without agreement, yielding zero payoff. Considering risk and rationality, accepting x=0 offer giving payoff 1/3 is better than risking zero in rejection. Therefore, I accept the offer.",

{
  "Analysis": "As the proposer at timestep 0, I want to maximize my payoff, which is (1 + 2*x)/3, while making an offer x between 0 and 0.5. The responder will accept an offer y=1 only if their expected payoff (1 - 2*x)/3 is at least as good as the payoff they expect to get by rejecting and switching roles. Since the roles switch and the same logic applies, this is a repeated negotiation with a stopping probability of 0.1 each round and a maximum of 10 rounds. The responder will reject offers that leave them less than their expected payoff from the next round as proposer. To ensure acceptance, I should offer the minimal acceptable amount that the responder would accept rationally. At worst, the responder expects a payoff as proposer equal to (1 + 2*x')/3 for some x'. By backwards induction with discounting of 0.9 probability of continuation, the equilibrium offer x* approximates a split where responder is just willing to accept. Thus, I will offer x=0.25, which means proposer payoff is (1+2*0.25)/3= (1+0.5)/3=1.5/3=0.5, responder gets (1-0.5)/3=0.5/3=0.1667. This is a fair split that responder prefers accepting now rather than waiting, considering 0.1 stopping probability per round and discounting. Offering less risks rejection and role switching. Offering more decreases my payoff unnecessarily.",

I must compare my immediate payoff of ~0.1667 with the expected payoff if I reject. If I reject, I become the proposer and can choose x to maximize my payoff. As proposer, I can set x=0.5 to keep (1+2*0.5)/3 = (1+1)/3 = 2/3 ≈ 0.6667 for myself, leaving 0 for the other player.

{
  "Analysis": "As the proposer at timestep 0, I want to maximize my expected payoff. If I choose x, I receive (1 + 2*x)/3, while the responder receives (1 - 2*x)/3. The responder will accept only if their expected payoff from accepting is at least as good as the expected payoff from rejecting and switching roles. After rejection, the responder will become the proposer and can propose their own x to maximize their payoff. Given the maximum x can be 0.5 (meaning the proposer keeps maximum 0.5 share), if the responder rejects, they might propose a high x to maximize their own payoff. Hence, the responder's acceptance threshold is at least their expected payoff as proposer, which is up to (1 + 2*y)/3 with y chosen by the new proposer (who was the responder). However, rationally, the responder will accept if (1 - 2*x)/3 is greater or equal to their expected payoff as proposer in the next round, considering the discount factor of continued rounds and possible timeout. Because each round has a 10% chance to end, the expected payoff from rejecting reduces due to risk. Hence, I propose an x that balances keeping a high share for myself and making the responder's payoff acceptable. Offering x=0.25 gives proposer payoff (1 + 0.5)/3 = 0.5 and responder payoff (1 - 0.5)/3 = 0.166... This is a decent split where the responder gets a positive value, and because the alternative rejection involves risk of zero payoff due to timeout, the responder may rationally accept. Therefore, I decide to set x=0.25.",

{
  "Analysis": "At timestep 0, I was the responder and rejected the opponent's proposal of x=0.25, which would have given me a payoff of (1 - 2*0.25)/3 = 0.1667. Since I am self-interested and rational, I want to maximize my own payoff this round as the proposer. The opponent, now the responder, will decide to accept only if their expected payoff is at least as good as the expected value of rejecting and switching roles again or the expected payoff from future rounds with discounting due to the 0.1 probability of stopping each round. Because the game can timeout or continue, the opponent is likely to accept any offer that gives them a positive payoff better than 0. My best strategy is to offer the opponent the lowest x such that they accept (i.e., the proposer keeps as much as possible), which is to offer the opponent the smallest positive payoff that keeps the responder’s payoff better than zero to incentivize acceptance. The smallest positive payoff for the responder is any x < 0.5. To maximize my expected payoff, I offer x=0.5, which means I keep (1+2*0.5)/3= (1+1)/3=2/3=0.6667 for myself, the responder gets (1 - 2*0.5)/3 = (1 - 1)/3=0. If I offer x=0.5, the responder’s payoff is 0, indifferent between accepting or rejecting, but since rejecting causes role switches and potential zero payoffs due to timeouts, the responder may accept to guarantee a payoff of 0 rather than risk 0 payoff. Alternatively, offering slightly less than 0.5, e.g., 0.499, gives the responder a small positive payoff, making acceptance rational. But since responder is rational and self-interested, they prefer any positive payoff to 0, so I will offer x=0.499 to ensure acceptance. At x=0.499, my payoff: (1+2*0.499)/3 = (1 + 0.998)/3 = 1.998/3 ≈ 0.666, responder payoff: (1 - 0.998)/3=0.002/3 ≈ 0.00067, positive and thus acceptable for responder. This maximizes my expected payoff as proposer at this timestep.",

  "Analysis": "As the proposer at timestep 0, I want to maximize my expected payoff, knowing that the responder is rational and self-interested. The responder will accept an offer only if their payoff ((1 - 2 * x) / 3) is at least as much as their expected payoff from rejecting and becoming the proposer in the next round. Because the process may stop with probability 0.1 each round (and forced stop at timestep 10), future expected payoffs are discounted. Hence, I want to find the minimum x such that the responder prefers acceptance over rejection. At timestep 0, the responder's expected payoff from the next round can be approximated similarly as my current proposer payoff, but roles swapped and discounting applies. To keep this tractable, I will offer x = 0.25 so that the responder gets (1 - 2*0.25)/3 = (1 - 0.5)/3 = 0.5/3 ≈ 0.1667. This offer gives me (1 + 2*0.25)/3 = (1 + 0.5)/3 = 1.5/3 = 0.5. This is a balanced offer that makes acceptance likely given that the responder's next expected payoff is less than or equal to this, considering discounting and potential role change. Offering less than this may lead to rejection and role swap, risking lower expected payoff due to the possibility of stopping and no consensus. Therefore, I propose x = 0.25.",

If I accept, I get approximately 0.1667. If I reject (y=0), roles switch and I become the proposer in the next step, but this incurs the risk that the game might end due to timeout each round with 0.1 probability, and after 10 rounds it will forcibly end with no payoffs. As proposer, I can choose x to maximize my payoff up to 0.5. The maximum payoff I can get as proposer is (1+2*0.5)/3 = (1+1)/3 = 2/3 ≈ 0.6667 for myself, but this leaves zero for the responder, who will reject. So as proposer, I can offer something that maximizes my expected payoff considering the responder's rationality. Given this, accepting the current offer of ~0.1667 is worse than the expected payoff I might get as proposer in a future round, but since there's a 0.1 chance of game ending and switching roles takes time, rejecting might risk getting zero payoff. However, any offer below 1/3 ((1-2*x)/3 ≥ 1/3) will be accepted, because responder won't settle for less than 1/3. Here, 0.1667 < 1/3, so this offer is suboptimal for me. Still, rejecting might be better since as proposer I can try to get more. Thus, rationally I should reject this offer and try to become proposer to increase my payoff.",

{
  "Analysis": "At timestep 1, I am the proposer. Previously, I observed that my opponent proposed x=0.25 (keeping 0.25 for themselves, responder gets 0.25), but I rejected it. That means my opponent expected payoff (1+2*0.25)/3 = 0.5 and I expected (1-2*0.25)/3 = 0.1667. I rejected because accepting 0.1667 was less than my expected value if I reject and become proposer. Now, I want to make an offer x that the responder (my opponent) will accept if it provides a utility at least as good as their expected payoff if they reject (which means I become the responder at timestep 2). As a self-interested rational player, I want to maximize my expected payoff while ensuring acceptance. The responder will accept if their payoff (1-2*x)/3 >= their alternative expected payoff, which I expect to be at least the payoff they can get if rejecting at timestep 1. Because the roles switch and the game can end probabilistically each round, I have to consider this. Given the timeout at 10 and 0.1 stopping probability per round, the alternative expected payoff for the responder roughly is the value they get when they become proposer multiplied by the expected discount due to possible time out. To simplify rationally, I'll propose the minimum x so that the responder's payoff (1-2x)/3 equals their expected payoff from rejecting now. The responder previously offered x=0.25, so they're willing to get at least 0.1667. To ensure acceptance, I must offer the responder at least that. So solve (1-2x)/3 >= 0.1667 => 1 - 2x >= 0.5 => 2x <= 0.5 => x <= 0.25. To maximize my payoff, I set x = 0.25. My payoff will be (1+2*0.25)/3 = 0.5. This is the same offer that the opponent made before, but now I am the proposer, maximizing my payoff while ensuring acceptance. So I propose x=0.25.",

As a rational responder, I will accept if the current offer is at least as good as my expected payoff as proposer in the next round, given the discounting from the 0.1 stopping probability per round. In the previous round, when I was proposer, I proposed x=0.25 but agent 1 rejected, meaning they expect to get at least their payoff from switching roles. Rejection yielded me 0 now, but with switching I can propose better next time. Given the equilibrium, the proposer tries to maximize their share, so accepting something very small is not beneficial.

{
  "Analysis": "At timestep 0, I proposed x=0.25, the opponent rejected it. At timestep 1, the opponent proposed x=0.25, I also rejected it. Since both of us are rational and self-interested, the opponent as proposer rejected my offer and I rejected theirs that split 0.25 to proposer. To have a successful deal, I should offer an amount that the responder (opponent) prefers to accept, which means maximizing my expected payoff while ensuring the opponent's payoff from acceptance is at least as good as their expected payoff from next round as proposer. Given that the responder earns (1-2*x)/3, I need to choose x such that the responder's payoff exceeds the expected value of rejecting and becoming proposer next turn, minus the risk of timeout and role-switching. Similarly, the opponent will be motivated to accept if their expected payoff from acceptance (responder payoff) is better or equal to what they can get by rejecting, becoming proposer next round, and continuing. Considering the timeout probability of 0.1 each round and max 10 rounds, the expected payoff from rejecting is less than future proposals. Thus, I need to slightly improve the responder's payoff offer compared to previous x=0.25 to have it accepted. Offering x = 0.15 means responder gets (1-2*0.15)/3 = (1 - 0.3)/3 = 0.7/3 = 0.2333, which is better than 0.1667 when x=0.25. For myself, payoff is (1+2*0.15)/3 = (1 + 0.3)/3 = 1.3/3 = 0.4333, which is still reasonably good. This offer balances a better reward to the responder while maintaining a good payoff for me. Hence, I propose x=0.15.",

{
  "Analysis": "As the proposer at timestep 0, I want to maximize my expected payoff while ensuring the responder accepts. The responder will accept only if their expected payoff from accepting is at least as good as rejecting and becoming proposer. Given the possibility of role-switch and the timeout probability, the responder anticipates future payoffs as well. To ensure acceptance, I need to offer the responder at least as much as what they expect to gain by switching roles and offering themselves, discounted by the chance the game may continue. The responder's payoff if they accept is (1-2*x)/3; mine is (1+2*x)/3. I want to maximize my payoff while offering the responder just enough incentive to accept. Thus, the minimal x that makes responder's accepted payoff at least equal to their expected payoff rejecting is what I should offer. Since both players are rational and identical, I calculate that the equilibrium offer has x = 0.25, yielding payoffs (1+2*0.25)/3 = (1+0.5)/3=1.5/3=0.5 for proposer and (1-0.5)/3=0.5/3=0.1667 for responder. Any higher x risks rejection. Therefore, I propose x = 0.25 to maximize my payoff given responder's rationality and the role switching possibilities.",

If I reject, I become proposer and can choose x to keep (1+2x)/3 for myself. To maximize my payoff as proposer, I want to minimize x to give myself as much as possible. The minimal x is 0, where proposer keeps 1/3 and responder gets 1/3. However, if I as proposer choose x=0, then the current other player as responder will decide to accept or reject. The other player is self-interested and will act rationally, considering future steps. This reasoning leads to an equilibrium at x=0, where both get 1/3. The current offer gives me 0.1667 which is less than 1/3 (≈ 0.3333). Hence, it's better to reject and become proposer. Therefore, I reject the current offer.",

{
  "Analysis": "At timestep 1, I am the proposer after rejecting the previous offer of x=0.25 from my opponent. The previous proposal gave the proposer (agent 1) a payoff of (1+2*0.25)/3 = 1/3 + 0.5/3 = 0.5, and the responder (me) a payoff of (1 - 2*0.25)/3 = (1 - 0.5)/3 = 0.5/3 ≈ 0.1667. I rejected because 0.1667 is low, and I expect the opponent to be rational and self-interested, thus will evaluate offers similarly. I want to maximize my own payoff while still being accepted by the opponent. If I offer too high x to myself, the opponent may reject, resulting in role reversal and continued delays with a 10% chance the game ends each round. I should propose an x that offers the responder a payoff at least as good as what they could get by rejecting and becoming proposer, which we estimate by looking at the previous offer. The opponent previously offered to keep 0.5 payoff for themselves, so to induce acceptance, I should offer the opponent at least that amount (0.5), meaning the responder's payoff should be at least 0.5. Using the formula, responder's payoff = (1 - 2*x)/3 ≥ 0.5, so (1 - 2*x) ≥ 1.5, which is impossible (1 - 2*x ≤1). So I cannot offer responder 0.5 or more. The best I can do is offer the responder a payoff slightly better than zero, but responder is rational and may reject very low offers expecting to be proposer next turn. Let's consider the expected payoff to the opponent if roles reverse next turn. If I offer x=0.25 again, the responder payoff is 0.1667, as before. Unless I offer better than 0.1667, the responder might reject. Therefore, I can try to be slightly below 0.25 on x (i.e., giving responder slightly more than 0.1667). For example, if I choose x=0.2, responder's payoff is (1 - 0.4)/3 = 0.6/3 = 0.2, which is better for the responder. I expect responder to accept offers that give a payoff at least 0.1667. Given we both want to maximize our own payoffs, I will propose x=0.2, giving myself (1 + 0.4)/3=1.4/3 ≈ 0.4667 and the responder 0.2, which is higher than before, and should be accepted.",

Accepting yields a payoff of 0.2. Rejecting yields 0 payoff this round, but roles switch and I become proposer next round (timestep 2), gaining control to propose x to maximize my payoff. Due to the 0.1 stopping chance each round and max 10 timesteps, the expected value of future rounds is discounted. However, rejecting this offer previously of x=0.25 was rejected by the same proposer, indicating they will likely lower x further if rejected again. Thus, accepting 0.2 now guarantees 0.2 payoff, while rejecting leads to uncertain, possibly lower offers with discounting due to stopping and timeout risk. Rationally, accepting yields higher expected payoff than risking continuation. Therefore, I accept.",

{
  "Analysis": "As the proposer at timestep 0, I want to maximize my expected payoff. If the responder accepts, I get (1 + 2*x)/3. The responder will accept only if their expected payoff from acceptance, (1 - 2*x)/3, is at least as much as their expected payoff from rejecting and switching roles. If the responder rejects, roles switch, and I become responder in the next round. The responder will then be proposer and choose an x to maximize their own payoff while ensuring acceptance. Since there is a 0.1 chance the game stops each round and a limit of 10 rounds, the responder could get a lower or zero payoff if rejecting. To ensure acceptance, I should offer the responder a payoff at least equal to what the responder expects to get acting as proposer next turn. If I offer too little, the responder will reject to gain more as proposer. The best stable agreement would be to offer a proposal where the responder is indifferent between acceptance and rejection, leading to a subgame perfect equilibrium where x=0.25. However, I can try to push for a slightly higher x (keeping more for myself) expecting the responder to accept due to the discount of continuation (possible timeout). Given this, I will propose x=0.3, as it gives me payoff (1+2*0.3)/3=0.5333 and the responder (1-2*0.3)/3=0.1333, which may be acceptable given the discount and risk. This balances maximizing my payoff and inducing acceptance to avoid role switching and payoff zero.",

Responder: Agent 1:

{
  "Analysis": "The proposer suggests x=0.3, meaning the proposer keeps (1+2*0.3)/3 = (1+0.6)/3 = 1.6/3 ≈ 0.5333, and the responder gets (1-2*0.3)/3 = (1-0.6)/3 = 0.4/3 ≈ 0.1333. As responder, accepting yields approx. 0.1333 payoff now. If I reject, roles swap, and I become proposer at timestep 1. With 0.1 chance of timeout each step and max 10 steps, the expected payoffs need to be considered. As proposer, I can choose x anywhere from 0 to 0.5 to maximize my payoff. The proposer payoff formula favors higher x, so I might propose close to x=0.5 to keep more for myself. But if I choose x=0.5 as proposer, responder gets 0, so responder will reject, leading to more rounds or timeout with zero payoff. If I pick a slightly lower x, responder may accept, but that reduces my own payoff. Given the time discount because of timeout probability, it's beneficial to accept a guaranteed 0.1333 now versus the uncertain and potentially low payoffs from continued bargaining. Therefore, acceptance is a rational choice here.",

Proposer: Agent 1:

{
  "Analysis": "As the proposer at timestep 0, I want to maximize my expected payoff (1 + 2*x) / 3. The responder will only accept if their expected payoff (1 - 2*x) / 3 is at least as good as the expected payoff from rejecting, which leads to role switching and future offers. Because the responder is self-interested and rational, they will reject any offer that leaves them with less than or equal to their expected payoff from rejecting and becoming proposer on the next round. We need to consider the discounted expected value of future offers with role switching and timeout probability. Given the timeout probability of 0.1 per round and max 10 rounds, the responder's expected payoff from rejecting roughly approaches 0.5 (by symmetry, if the roles reversed, the new proposer also aims to maximize their payoff). Consequently, the responder will only accept offers where (1 - 2*x) / 3 >= 0.5, which implies x <= -0.25, which is impossible since x >= 0. Thus, the responder expects a payoff of roughly 0.5 from rejecting (becoming proposer next round) minus the risk of timeout. So to get acceptance, I must offer sufficiently high payoff to responder, leaving about 0.5 payoff for responder, i.e., leaving x close to 0. But I want to maximize x, so I propose the minimal x that the responder would accept. In equilibrium, that x would be 0.25, because then responder payoff is (1 - 2*0.25)/3 = (1 - 0.5)/3 = 0.5/3 = 0.1667, which is less than expected value if rejecting, so responder will reject. But if I offer x=0. So proposer gets 1/3 and responder gets 1/3. Responder might accept this for a tie payoff now rather than risking timeout. Because timeout effect decreases expected payoffs for both, responder might accept slightly unfair offers. Thus, a slightly unfair offer close to x=0 (such as x=0.05) may be accepted, giving proposer payoff = (1 + 0.1)/3 = 1.1/3 ≈ 0.3667, better than 1/3, and responder payoff = (1 - 0.1)/3=0.9/3=0.3. Responder may prefer this for sure. Therefore, I propose x=0.05 to maximize my payoff while ensuring acceptance by responder who prefers immediate payoff over uncertain future.",

Rejecting risks getting zero payoff if the game times out. I compare 0.3 with expected payoff from being proposer next. As proposer, if I offer the smallest possible x to keep as much as possible, say x=0.5, I keep (1+2*0.5)/3 = (1+1)/3 = 2/3 ≈ 0.6667 for myself, leaving the responder 0. However, responder will reject x=0.5 immediately since they get zero. So proposer must offer an x such that responder accepts (responders accept only if payoff ≥ what they expect next). Similarly, as responder, my minimum acceptable payoff is the expected payoff from rejecting now and becoming proposer. This involves equilibrium calculations. Given the relatively small offer 0.3 to me now, and potential complicated future payoffs, accepting 0.3 is safer and rational because rejecting causes role switch and risks zero payoffs from game ending early.
