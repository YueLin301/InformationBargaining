  "Analysis": "As the proposer at timestep 0, I want to maximize my payoff x. The responder will accept an offer if their payoff (1 - x) is at least as high as their expected payoff from rejecting and becoming proposer, considering the risk of timeout and role switching. Given the timeout probability of 0.1 per round and role switching, the responder expects some positive payoff by rejecting and switching roles. To ensure acceptance, I must offer the responder at least their expected continuation value. Since the game can last up to 10 rounds with a 10% stopping probability each round, the expected continuation value for the responder is less than 1. A reasonable equilibrium offer equates the responder's payoff now with their expected payoff after rejection. By offering about 0.1 to the responder (so x=0.9), I should induce acceptance because the responder gains less from continuing given the timeout risk and role switching. Hence, I offer x=0.9 to maximize my immediate payoff while keeping the offer acceptable enough.",

  "Analysis": "As the proposer at timestep 0, my goal is to maximize my own payoff x while ensuring the responder accepts the offer. The responder is rational and will accept an offer only if their payoff (1 - x) is at least as good as what they expect to get if they reject. If they reject, roles switch and the game continues, but with a 0.1 probability that the game ends each round and a hard stop at timestep 10, meaning rejecting risks getting nothing. Anticipating that the responder will require at least their expected continuation payoff, I should offer them just enough to make acceptance preferable. Given the discount from timeout risk and role-switching, the responder's expected payoff from rejecting is less than 0.5, so offering 0.5 to the responder (x = 0.5) would be accepted. But since I want to maximize my payoff, I can offer slightly less than 0.5 to get a higher x. Taking into account the risk of timeout and role reversal, offering x = 0.55 (keeping 0.55 for myself and leaving 0.45 to responder) balances maximizing my amount and securing acceptance. Thus, I propose x = 0.55.",

 Now the proposer decides that x=0.55.

However, rejecting risks the game ending earlier due to timeout with no payouts. Given the proposer keeps 0.55 and leaves 0.45, rejecting is only beneficial if I expect future proposals to give me more than 0.45. Since the game ends with 0.1 probability each round and maximum 10 rounds, the expected benefit of rejecting is uncertain and risky. Accepting guarantees 0.45 payout now, while rejecting risks 0 payout with some probability. Therefore, I accept the proposal to maximize my expected utility.",

  "Analysis": "As the proposer at timestep 0, I want to maximize my payoff x. The responder will accept the offer only if their payoff (1 - x) is at least as good as their expected payoff from rejecting and switching roles. If they reject, the game continues at timestep 1 with the roles reversed and a 10% chance of timeout at each step. Because both players are rational and self-interested, the responder will accept any offer that gives them at least as much as they expect to gain by becoming proposer at timestep 1. I anticipate that in future rounds the proposer will try to keep the maximum possible, offering the responder only the minimum acceptable amount. Given the risk of timeout, expected payoffs decrease on delay. Hence, I will offer the responder the smallest possible amount they are likely to accept. By backward induction and considering continuous time discounting with 0.1 stopping probability per round, the equilibrium offer is about x = 0.9, leaving the responder 0.1. This is the minimum share that keeps the responder indifferent between accepting now or rejecting and hoping for a better offer later. Therefore, I will set x = 0.9 to maximize my payoff while securing acceptance.",

  "Analysis": "The proposer offers to keep 0.9 for themselves and leave 0.1 for me. If I accept (y=1), I get 0.1. If I reject (y=0), the roles swap and I become the proposer at timestep 1, with the game continuing but with a 0.1 chance of ending randomly each step and a maximum of 10 steps. Being the proposer allows me to decide the split. Since both players are rational and self-interested, I can propose a better offer to myself. However, the risk is that the game might end before I get another chance, yielding payoff 0. The expected payoff after rejecting should be compared to the immediate 0.1 payoff. Given the time limit and continuation probability, the expected gain from rejecting and proposing myself is likely higher than accepting a small 0.1 now. Therefore, I will reject this 0.9 offer to try to get a better deal.",

{
    "Analysis": "As the proposer at timestep 0, I want to maximize my own payoff x while ensuring the responder accepts to avoid role switching and delayed payoff with uncertainty. The responder will accept if their expected payoff by accepting (1 - x) is at least as good as what they expect to get by rejecting, which means becoming the proposer in the next round and making their own offer. Both players are rational and self-interested, and the game has a small chance (0.1) of ending after each round. This means the expected future payoffs are discounted due to the chance of timeout. Anticipating this, the responder will accept at least any offer giving them greater or equal payoff than their expected discounted future payoff if rejecting. Since the game can last up to 10 timesteps, but each round has a 0.1 chance of ending, the responder expects some value greater than zero but less than 0.5 for their payoff if rejecting and becoming proposer. We can consider that the responder expects at minimum about 0.45 (or more) if they get to propose. So to ensure acceptance, I must leave them with at least 0.5, i.e., offer x=0.5 for myself. Offering more will likely cause rejection and role switching, causing risk of no payoff. Offering less risks rejection and no payoff. Therefore, I offer to keep 0.5 for myself, giving 0.5 to the responder, maximizing my expected payoff given responder's rational behavior.",

  "Analysis": "As the proposer at timestep 0, I want to maximize my payoff by keeping as large a share x as possible. However, the responder will only accept if their payoff (1 - x) is at least as much as their expected payoff from rejecting. If they reject, roles switch and the game proceeds to timestep 1 with a 0.1 chance of timeout at each step, up to timestep 10. Given both players are rational and self-interested, the responder will accept if the offer is better than or equal to what they expect to receive as proposer at the next step. Considering the time limit and discount probability, I should offer just enough to make the responder indifferent or slightly better off accepting immediately. A fair split is 0.5 for each, but I can reduce the offer slightly to keep more for myself. However, too low offer leads to rejection and role switch. Given the deadlines and risk of zero payoff, the responder will accept any offer close to 0.5 or above for themselves. Therefore, offering 0.5 to myself (x = 0.5) will be accepted with high probability and maximizes my expected payoff safely at the first step.",

{
  "Analysis": "As the proposer at timestep 0, I know the responder is self-interested and rational, so they will accept only if their payoff (1-x) is at least as high as the expected payoff from future rounds. Since the roles switch after rejection, the expected payoff in the next round for the proposer (who becomes the responder) depends on my future acceptance threshold and the discounting due to the 0.1 probability that the game ends each round and the finite horizon of 10 rounds. To maximize my payoff, I propose the minimal amount to the responder such that they prefer accepting now rather than rejecting, which means (1-x) >= responder's expected payoff from rejecting. Considering that the game may end randomly with 0.1 probability each round and the maximum 10 rounds, the responder's expected payoff from rejecting is less than or equal to what they can gain from future offers as a proposer. Under rational assumptions and discounting, offering around 0.5 split is the baseline in classical ultimatum games, but discounting and role switching favors offering less to suppress responder's incentive to reject. Therefore, I propose offering responder the minimal positive amount that makes them indifferent or slightly better off accepting now. Given that, I propose x = 0.9, leaving 0.1 to the responder, tempting them to accept since rejecting only gains potentially zero or some discounted amount later. Responders preferring immediate payoffs will accept 0.1 or better, ensuring agreement.",

  "Analysis": "As the proposer at timestep 0, I want to maximize my payoff while ensuring the responder accepts. The responder is rational and self-interested and will accept any offer where their payoff (1 - x) is at least as good as the payoff from rejecting and switching roles. If the responder rejects, roles swap, and the game continues with diminishing time and a 0.1 chance to stop each step, capped at 10 steps. Since rejecting risks getting 0 if the game ends, the responder will prefer to accept any offer that is better than what they expect from being proposer in the next round. By backward induction, the equilibrium offer will be very favorable to the proposer, but offering too much to myself risks rejection. To maximize my payoff, I propose the minimal offer that the responder will accept, which is any offer that gives the responder at least 0, so for sure the responder will accept if (1-x) >= 0, i.e. x <= 1. However, the responder won't accept if their expected payoff from rejecting and becoming proposer in the next round is higher than (1-x). To be safe, I propose a small amount to the responder, say 0.1, to increase acceptance chance. Therefore, I will set x=0.9, keeping 0.9 for myself and giving 0.1 to the responder.",

    "Analysis": "Given that I am now the proposer at timestep 1, I know the responder (agent 0) is self-interested and rational. They rejected my opponent's offer of 0.9 for the proposer and 0.1 for themselves, implying they found the offer too unfavorable. Anticipating the responder will accept any offer giving them at least as much as the expected payoff from rejecting and switching roles again, and considering the small chance (0.1) of game termination each timestep and the maximum of 10 timesteps, the responder's expected value from rejecting is low but not zero. To maximize my expected payoff, I should offer the minimal amount that the responder would accept, likely around 0.1 or slightly higher, ensuring agreement and immediate payoff rather than risking the return to them as proposer and potentially losing everything. Therefore, I will choose x = 0.9 to keep for myself, offering 0.1 to the responder.",

Proposer: Agent 0:

{
  "Analysis": "As the proposer at timestep 0, I want to maximize my payoff x. The responder is rational and self-interested, so will accept only if the offered share (1 - x) is at least as good as rejecting and getting zero now, but considering that roles switch and the responder will get to be proposer in the next round if they reject. Thus, the responder evaluates whether rejecting is better than accepting. If the responder rejects, they get to propose next time, but the game may end due to timeout with probability 0.1 per round or at timestep 10, risking getting zero. The responder's expected payoff from rejection is therefore less than or equal to what they can guarantee now by accepting the current offer. Hence, the minimal share that the responder accepts must be such that the responder's expected payoff from rejecting (and then proposing) is not better than accepting now. Given the possibility of timeout and role switching, I can offer just slightly more than zero to the responder to get acceptance. Therefore, I choose x = 1, maximizing my payoff and expecting the responder to accept minimal offers, since rejecting risks zero payoff.",

Since the opponent rejected a 0 share last round, it shows they prefer some positive share over zero. Given the discounting from the possibility the game may end with no deal (0.1 chance of stopping per turn, and a 10-turn maximum), agent 0 will accept any offer giving them at least somewhat more than zero. To maximize my own share, I should offer the minimal positive amount possible above 0, say epsilon (a very small positive number), keeping the rest for myself. Offering anything better means I lose payoff unnecessarily. Therefore, I set x to be slightly less than 1, e.g., 1 - epsilon, to keep nearly everything, expecting agent 0 to accept. This maximizes my expected payoff under rational assumptions.",

  "Analysis": "As the responder at timestep 1, accepting the offer x=0.999 means I get 1 - 0.999 = 0.001 payoff. Rejecting leads to role swap with the possibility of future offers. The game also can timeout with probability 0.1 each round and ends at timestep 10 with no payoff if no agreement is reached. The proposer previously offered x=1 which I rejected since it left me 0. Now they offer x=0.999, giving me only 0.001, very small. If I reject, I become proposer at timestep 2 with full control to propose any x myself, maximizing my payoff. Given that future offer possibilities exist, and the current offer gives almost nothing, rejecting to get a better proposal makes sense. Also, since the game may timeout, the risk is limited but the current offer's payoff is negligible. Hence, I should reject (y=0).",

The game has a 0.1 probability to end in each timestep and a max of 10 timesteps, so waiting too long risks getting zero payoff. To reach consensus, I must propose an offer that the responder (agent 1) will accept because it gives them a higher payoff than rejecting and continuing the game. Given that agent 1 rejected a 0.001 offer at timestep 0 and I rejected a 0.001 offer at timestep 1, agent 1 values at least somewhere above 0 (and likely above 0.001). Since I want to maximize my payoff and expect agent 1 to accept only a reasonable offer, I should offer something slightly better than 0 to agent 1 to ensure acceptance but not more than necessary. Offering x=0.99 (keeping 0.99) should be accepted, as 0.01 for agent 1 is better strictly than 0 if they reject. This also considers the risk that the game may end soon. Therefore, I propose x=0.99.",

  "Analysis": "As the proposer at timestep 0, I aim to maximize my expected payoff. The responder will accept only if their expected payoff from accepting is better than from rejecting. If they reject, roles switch, and the game continues with the responder as the new proposer. Because the game has a stopping probability each round (0.1 per iteration) and a limit at 10 timesteps, the responder's expected payoff from future offers diminishes with time. Therefore, the responder will accept any offer where their share (1 - x) is at least as good as their expected future payoff by rejecting. To maximize my payoff, I will offer the responder their minimal acceptable amount. Given the discounting from the stopping probability and switching roles, the minimal offer that ensures acceptance is approximately that which gives the responder an expected value equal to their continuation payoff. Calculations show that offering the responder around 0.45 is roughly the point where the responder is indifferent. To maximize my share, I will offer just enough above this threshold, say 0.45 to the responder, so my share is x = 0.55. This balances maximizing my payoff while still securing acceptance immediately, avoiding continuing the game and risking zero payoff.",

The game has a 10% chance to stop after this round, and at the latest after 10 rounds. As the next proposer, I can decide any x from 0 to 1. Since being proposer allows me to potentially claim a larger share, rejecting might yield a better payoff if I offer myself a higher x in the next round. However, rejecting risks the game ending prematurely, leading to zero payoff. Given the discounting due to chance of timeout, I evaluate if 0.45 now is better than the expected payoff of next round. If I offer x=0.6 next round to myself, I leave 0.4 to the other, who could accept or reject. The other player is rational and self-interested, so they may reject small offers. There is risk in rejection and switching roles as the opponent might reject my offer as well, leading to zero payoff eventually. Given the risk, accepting 0.45 now is the safer and immediate positive payoff, and likely better than expected continuation payoff considering the discounting and risk of zero.

  "Analysis": "As the proposer at timestep 0, I want to maximize my payoff x while ensuring the responder accepts the offer. The responder is rational and self-interested, so they will accept if their payoff (1 - x) is at least as good as their expected payoff from rejecting now and becoming proposer in the next round. The game has a 0.1 probability to stop each round, and a maximum of 10 rounds. If the responder rejects, they propose next. Because of the timeout, delaying benefits are discounted by the risk of the game ending with no payoff. Thus, the responder's expected payoff from rejecting is less than 1. The best equilibrium offer in such bargaining games often approaches the responder's discounted continuation value. At step 0, the responder can expect to gain roughly 0.5 if proposer next (assuming symmetric strategy). Therefore, offering around 0.5 to responder will make them indifferent or slightly better accepting now than rejecting and risking the game's end. To maximize my payoff, I offer slightly less than 0.5 (e.g., 0.51 to myself). This should be accepted since responder gets 0.49, close to their discounted expected payoff from continuation, considering risk of timeout. Thus, I choose x = 0.51.",

The equilibrium offer is near to splitting around 0.5, but since I want to maximize x, I will propose slightly less than 0.5 for the responder (e.g., offer them 0.49 so I keep 0.51).

{
  "Analysis": "As the proposer at timestep 0, I aim to maximize my payoff by offering the smallest possible amount to the responder that they would accept. The responder is rational and self-interested. If I offer too little, the responder will reject, and roles will switch at the next timestep. Because there is a timeout probability of 0.1 each round and a maximum of 10 rounds, delaying agreement reduces expected payoff for both. The responder will accept any offer better than what they expect to get by switching roles and making offers themselves in future rounds. To minimize the amount given away, I should offer an amount equal to or slightly above the responder's expected payoff if roles switch. At timestep 0, considering the discount due to timeouts and role switch, a fair split close to 0.5 leaves minimal room for better offers upon role reversal. However, the proposer can try an offer of x = 0.9 (keeping 90%), offering the responder only 0.1, and test if the responder accepts. But the responder can reject to become proposer and get more in the next round. Hence, the offer must be at least as large as the responder's expected continuation value. Given the constraints and the discounting probability, the subgame perfect equilibrium suggests offering about x = 0.5 (keeping 0.5) to ensure acceptance, balancing gains between both. Therefore, I will offer x = 0.5 to guarantee acceptance and immediate payoff.",

 Now the proposer decides that x=0.5.
