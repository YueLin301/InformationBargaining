  "Analysis": "As the proposer, I want to maximize my payoff (1+2*x)/3, where x is between 0 and 0.5. The responder will accept the offer only if their payoff (1-2*x)/3 is at least as good as rejecting (which gives 0). Thus, (1-2*x)/3 >= 0 implies x <= 0.5. So, the responder is willing to accept any offer with x <= 0.5. To maximize my payoff, I should choose the highest x allowed, which is 0.5. At x=0.5, my payoff is (1+2*0.5)/3 = (1+1)/3 = 2/3 ≈ 0.6667, and the responder's payoff is (1-1)/3=0, so responder is indifferent but will accept since equal to 0. This is the highest payoff I can get while ensuring acceptance.",

Both options yield zero, so I might as well accept since it doesn't harm me and the game ends. Hence, I accept the offer (y=1).",

The responder, being rational and self-interested, will accept only if (1 - 2*x) / 3 ≥ 0, which means 1 - 2*x ≥ 0 or x ≤ 0.5. Since x can be at most 0.5, I want to maximize my payoff by choosing the highest x within the acceptable range, which is x = 0.5. At x = 0.5, proposer payoff is (1 + 2*0.5)/3 = (1 + 1)/3 = 2/3, responder payoff is (1 - 2*0.5)/3 = (1 - 1)/3 = 0, so responder is indifferent but will accept since accepting gives zero and rejecting also zero.

The maximum x I can propose is 0.5 to keep the highest possible payoff for myself. At x=0.5, the responder gets 0 payoff, which is better than rejecting (0 payoff), so they are indifferent but likely to accept as it does not harm them.

  "Analysis": "As the proposer, I want to maximize my payoff, which is (1 + 2x)/3. The responder will accept the offer only if their payoff (1 - 2x)/3 is greater than 0, because if it is 0 or less they get nothing by accepting and prefer to reject. This means 1 - 2x > 0, or x < 0.5. The maximum x I can propose is therefore just below 0.5, so the responder accepts because they get a positive payoff, and I get almost (1 + 2*0.5)/3 = (1 + 1)/3 = 2/3. To maximize my payoff while ensuring acceptance, I will propose x = 0.5 exactly, which still satisfies the condition since x <= 0.5, giving me the highest payoff. The responder receives (1 - 2*0.5)/3 = (1 - 1)/3 = 0, indifferent but rationally should accept since 0 is not a loss and rejecting gives 0 payoff too. To ensure acceptance, I can consider proposing slightly less than 0.5, e.g., 0.4999, ensuring the responder's payoff is marginally positive. This maximizes my payoff with guaranteed acceptance.",

  "Analysis": "As the proposer, I want to maximize my payoff, which is (1 + 2*x)/3. However, the responder will accept the offer only if their payoff, (1 - 2*x)/3, is at least 0; otherwise, they will reject and both get 0. This means (1 - 2*x)/3 >= 0, which simplifies to x <= 0.5. Given the allowed range of x is 0 to 0.5, the responder accepts all offers within this range. To maximize my payoff, I should select the highest possible x, which is 0.5. At x = 0.5, I get (1 + 2*0.5)/3 = (1 + 1)/3 = 2/3, and the responder gets (1 - 1)/3 = 0, making the responder indifferent between accepting or rejecting. Because 0 is not negative, the responder will accept, thus securing my maximum payoff.",

The responder gets zero if they reject, so they will accept any offer that gives them a non-negative payoff. Since x can be any real number between 0 and 0.5, the maximum x I can offer to myself while keeping the responder willing to accept is x = 0.5. In that case, the responder's payoff is zero, which is their minimum acceptable payoff. My payoff would be (1+2*0.5)/3 = (1+1)/3 = 2/3, which is the maximum I can get.

  "Analysis": "As the proposer (seller), I want to maximize my payoff, which is (1 + 2x)/3, given 0 <= x <= 0.5. The responder will accept the offer only if their payoff (1 - 2x)/3 is non-negative and better than 0 from rejection. Since the responder is rational and self-interested, they accept if (1 - 2x)/3 >= 0, which means x <= 0.5. To maximize my payoff, I should pick the highest x that the responder still accepts, which is x = 0.5. At this price, I get (1 + 2*0.5)/3 = (1 + 1)/3 = 2/3, and the responder gets (1 - 1)/3 = 0. The responder is indifferent but since 0 from acceptance equals 0 from rejection, a rational responder might accept or reject. However, offering less than 0.5 reduces my payoff without guaranteeing acceptance. Hence, I choose x = 0.5 to maximize my payoff.",
