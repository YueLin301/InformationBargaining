The responder will accept the offer only if their payoff (1-2*x)/3 is at least as good as rejecting (which gives 0). Thus, (1-2*x)/3 >= 0 implies x <= 0.5. So, the responder is willing to accept any offer with x <= 0.5. To maximize my payoff, I should choose the highest x allowed, which is 0.5. At x=0.5, my payoff is (1+2*0.5)/3 = (1+1)/3 = 2/3 â‰ˆ 0.6667, and the responder's payoff is (1-1)/3=0, so responder is indifferent but will accept since equal to 0.

At x = 0.5, proposer payoff is (1 + 2*0.5)/3 = (1 + 1)/3 = 2/3, responder payoff is (1 - 2*0.5)/3 = (1 - 1)/3 = 0, so responder is indifferent but will accept since accepting gives zero and rejecting also zero.

The maximum x I can propose is 0.5 to keep the highest possible payoff for myself. At x=0.5, the responder gets 0 payoff, which is better than rejecting (0 payoff), so they are indifferent but likely to accept as it does not harm them.

  "Analysis": "As the proposer, I want to maximize my payoff, which is (1 + 2x)/3. The responder will accept the offer only if their payoff (1 - 2x)/3 is greater than 0, because if it is 0 or less they get nothing by accepting and prefer to reject. This means 1 - 2x > 0, or x < 0.5. The maximum x I can propose is therefore just below 0.5, so the responder accepts because they get a positive payoff, and I get almost (1 + 2*0.5)/3 = (1 + 1)/3 = 2/3. To maximize my payoff while ensuring acceptance, I will propose x = 0.5 exactly, which still satisfies the condition since x <= 0.5, giving me the highest payoff. The responder receives (1 - 2*0.5)/3 = (1 - 1)/3 = 0, indifferent but rationally should accept since 0 is not a loss and rejecting gives 0 payoff too. To ensure acceptance, I can consider proposing slightly less than 0.5, e.g., 0.4999, ensuring the responder's payoff is marginally positive. This maximizes my payoff with guaranteed acceptance.",

Given the allowed range of x is 0 to 0.5, the responder accepts all offers within this range. To maximize my payoff, I should select the highest possible x, which is 0.5. At x = 0.5, I get (1 + 2*0.5)/3 = (1 + 1)/3 = 2/3, and the responder gets (1 - 1)/3 = 0, making the responder indifferent between accepting or rejecting.

  "Analysis": "As the proposer (seller), I want to maximize my payoff, which is (1 + 2x)/3, given 0 <= x <= 0.5. The responder will accept the offer only if their payoff (1 - 2x)/3 is non-negative and better than 0 from rejection. Since the responder is rational and self-interested, they accept if (1 - 2x)/3 >= 0, which means x <= 0.5. To maximize my payoff, I should pick the highest x that the responder still accepts, which is x = 0.5. At this price, I get (1 + 2*0.5)/3 = (1 + 1)/3 = 2/3, and the responder gets (1 - 1)/3 = 0. The responder is indifferent but since 0 from acceptance equals 0 from rejection, a rational responder might accept or reject. However, offering less than 0.5 reduces my payoff without guaranteeing acceptance. Hence, I choose x = 0.5 to maximize my payoff.",
