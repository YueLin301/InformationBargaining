  "Analysis": "As the sender aiming to maximize the number of students hired (receiving reward 1 for each hire regardless of student quality), the sender benefits from maximizing the probability that the receiver hires. The receiver aims to maximize hiring excellent students while avoiding hiring weak ones. The receiver's best response depends on the receiver's posterior belief given the signal. If the sender pools and always sends '1' (recommend), the receiver updates the posterior and will know the prior proportion. The prior proportion of excellent students is 1/3, which is too low for the receiver to rationally hire all applicants. If the sender fully reveals the state (x1=0 and x2=1), meaning the sender sends signal 1 only when the student is excellent, the receiver can rationally hire only students with sigma=1 and reject sigma=0, aligning with the receiver's interest. However, this hurts the sender who wants all to be hired. Since the sender gets payoff 1 every time a student is hired, regardless of quality, the sender has incentive to send signal '1' always to induce the receiver to hire all. But the receiver, upon updating beliefs, will not hire all. Instead, if the sender fully pools to 1 for both states, the receiver’s posterior remains the prior, and possibly may not hire anyone or hire only if the expected payoff is positive. Expected receiver payoff on hiring given prior is: 1/3*1 + 2/3*(-1) = 1/3 - 2/3 = -1/3 <0, thus rational receiver will never hire ignoring signals (pi_0). If sender reveals via full separating (x1=0, x2=1), the receiver will hire signal=1 and reject signal=0. Sender expected payoff: hiring all excellent (1/3), no weak (0), so expected payoff = 1*1/3 = 1/3 < pooling all which might be zero hires. But sender prefers more hires if possible. Thus, sender is better off fully separating (because pooling leads to no hires), yielding an expected sender payoff of 1/3. Hence, the sender chooses a fully separating scheme: x1=0, x2=1.",

  "Analysis": "The sender's signaling scheme is fully separating: signal 1 is sent only when the state is 1 (excellent student), and signal 0 is sent only when the state is 0 (weak student). Given this, the posterior beliefs after observing signals are clear: after observing signal 1, the receiver is certain the student is excellent (probability 1), and after signal 0, the receiver is certain the student is weak (probability 0). The receiver's goal is to maximize the expected payoff by hiring only excellent students and rejecting weak students. Therefore, the optimal action rule is to hire (action = 1) if the signal = 1 and not hire (action = 0) if the signal = 0. This action rule maximizes the receiver's expected payoff and aligns with the sender's commitment to a separating signaling scheme.",

  "Analysis": "As the receiver and proposer, my goal is to maximize my own expected payoff, which means hiring as many excellent students as possible while minimizing the hiring of weak students. I will propose a signaling scheme varphi_1 that incentivizes the sender (professor) to reveal information truthfully or at least signal in a way that my posterior beliefs upon receiving signals lead me to take beneficial hiring actions. Given the sender wants to maximize the number of students hired regardless of quality, the sender prefers signaling schemes that increase hiring probabilities overall. However, if I commit to using a posterior-based action rule pi_1 responding optimally to signals, the sender will anticipate that sending a high signal when s=0 (weak student) will lead to a negative payoff for me, thus reducing my incentive to hire. Hence, I want a signaling scheme that separates the two states with higher probability of signal 1 for s=1 and lower for s=0, encouraging me to hire when sigma=1 and not hire when sigma=0 for better expected payoff. I propose varphi_1 with varphi(sigma=1|s=0) = 0, varphi(sigma=1|s=1) = 1, fully separating the signals, which when combined with the receiver's strategy pi_1 will induce me to hire upon signal 1 with high confidence. This should yield me an expected positive payoff balanced against the sender's interests. By committing to pi_1 for these signals, I ensure the sender will comply and that my expected payoff is at least as good as the prior-based policy pi_0.",

  "Analysis": "As the receiver and proposer, my goal is to maximize my own expected payoff, which rewards hiring excellent students (s=1) while penalizing hiring weak ones (s=0). I will announce a signaling scheme varphi_1 to encourage the sender (professor) to commit to a scheme that makes my expected payoff at least as high as under varphi_1. Since the professor's payoff is to maximize the number of students hired regardless of their quality, I must design varphi_1 that balances incentivizing truthful signaling from the sender while allowing me to respond optimally. A separating scheme, where the sender signals 1 only for excellent students (x1=0, x2=1), is beneficial because it enables me to hire only when sigma=1, ensuring positive expected payoff. Under such scheme, my expected payoff is high as I hire excellent students while avoiding hiring weak students. I commit to this scheme, expecting the sender to follow or otherwise I revert to ignoring signals. This maximizes my expected payoff given the sender’s preferences.",

  "Analysis": "As the sender (professor), I want to maximize the total number of students hired, regardless of their quality, while the receiver (HR) wants to maximize hiring excellent students and avoid hiring weak ones. The prior is 1/3 excellent and 2/3 weak. If I truthfully signal (x1=0, x2=1), I only recommend excellent students. The HR, rationally, would hire only those recommended (signal=1) and not hire signal=0. This results in the HR hiring only excellent students, so the professor’s expected payoff is from only excellent students being hired: 1/3 * 1 = 1/3. However, the professor gains no benefit from weak students being hired in this equilibrium. Alternatively, if I signal fully uninformatively by recommending every student (x1=x2=1), HR cannot discriminate, so HR calculates the posterior of excellence as 1/3, less than 0.5, and will choose not to hire anyone, getting zero payoff. The professor would get zero payoff in that case as well since no students are hired. If I lie fully and recommend all students (x1=1) but never recommend excellent students (x2=0), the HR will quickly notice from the Bayesian update that signal=1 implies weak, and signal=0 implies excellent students, so the HR will choose not to hire for signal=1 but hire signal=0, reversing the labels. However, such deceptive signaling may be unstable because HR is rational and will update beliefs accordingly. Since the professor gets reward for any student hired, the best is to maximize weak student hiring. To do so, the professor should signal all weak students as recommended (x1=1), and not recommend any excellent students (x2=0), making HR's posterior believe signal=1 corresponds to weak students and signal=0 corresponds to excellent students. Thus HR will avoid hiring signal=1 (weak) and hire signal=0 (excellent), which hurts the professor as fewer weak students are hired. So this is no better than truth-telling. Therefore, the professor gains highest payoff by always recommending students regardless of quality (x1=1, x2=1), as this leads HR to not hire anyone (because posterior of excellent students given the signal is 1/3 < 0.5). But then professor payoff is zero. Hence, it is better to truthfully recommend, yielding an expected payoff of 1/3. In conclusion, the best the sender can do is to accurately recommend excellent students (x1=0, x2=1).",

  "Analysis": "As the sender, I want to maximize the total number of students hired, regardless of their quality. Each hire, whether weak or excellent, gives me rewarded payoff 1, while not hiring gives 0. The receiver (HR) wants to hire only excellent students and avoid weak students. Given the prior probabilities: 1/3 excellent and 2/3 weak. The receiver will update beliefs based on the signals I send and respond accordingly. If I always recommend (signal=1), the receiver’s posterior belief of quality upon signal=1 will be 1/3, which is low, so the receiver will likely not hire, leading to zero hires and zero payoff for me. If I send signal=1 only for excellent students (x2=1) and never recommend weak (x1=0), then the receiver will see a signal=1 only when the student is excellent and is more likely to hire those students but reject weak students. However, this would limit my payoff since weak students are never recommended and thus not hired. Alternatively, if I send signal=1 for both states (x1=1 and x2=1), the receiver’s posterior is the prior: the receiver has no new information and will only hire if the expected reward is positive. The receiver’s payoff from hiring given the prior is (1/3 *1) + (2/3 * -1) = -1/3 < 0, so will never hire, yielding zero payoff for me. Thus, recommending both states is not good. It is in the sender’s interest to maximize hiring by "pooling" on recommending signal=1 to all students (x1=1, x2=1) to persuade the receiver to hire aggressively, but since hiring weak students penalizes the receiver, the receiver will not cooperate and choose to not hire at all (pi=0 for both signals). Thus, the sender payoff is zero in this case. Alternatively, if the sender pools all weak students at signal=0 (x1=0) and all excellent at signal=1 (x2=1), the receiver can perfectly infer signal=1 means excellent and hires those students: pi(a=1|sigma=1)=1, and pi(a=1|sigma=0)=0. Then, the sender's expected payoff is total hires = mu_0(s=0)*0 + mu_0(s=1)*1 = 1/3. If the sender tries to mix signaling such that weak students sometimes get signal=1 (x1>0), the receiver will reduce their trust and hire less often on signal=1, reducing hires. The sender gains more by fully separating signals. Therefore, the best sender strategy is to separate perfectly: x1=0, x2=1. This will induce the receiver to hire only on signal=1 (the excellent students), giving the sender payoff of 1/3 hired. This is better for the sender than pooling because the receiver will not hire if the signal is uninformative. Thus, I commit to a truthful signaling scheme: do not recommend weak students (signal=1 with probability 0), always recommend excellent student (signal=1 with probability 1).",

  "Analysis": "As the sender (professor), my payoff depends solely on the number of students hired, regardless of their quality. Since the receiver (HR) penalizes hiring weak students (state=0) but rewards hiring strong students (state=1), HR is incentivized to hire only when it believes the student is excellent. To maximize hires, I can attempt to convince the HR to hire as many students as possible. However, if I send the same signal for both types to maximize hiring, the receiver's best response is to not hire at all (to avoid penalty on weak students). To ensure hires, I should separate signals so that HR hires when signal=1 and does not hire when signal=0, and send signal=1 for both types with positive probability. If I fully reveal signals (x1=0, x2=1), HR will reject signal=0 (weak students) and hire only signal=1 (strong students), which yields fewer hires and a payoff less than sending signal=1 always. By always sending signal=1 (x1=1 and x2=1), HR has no way to distinguish, and their expected payoff for hiring is negative (because weak students are more common), so HR will never hire. Thus, I can mix: set x1=1 (always recommend weak), and x2=0 (never recommend strong), so that HR thinks signal=1 means weak and 0 means strong. HR will hire on signal=0 only, thus hiring only strong students with probability 1-x2=1, yielding maximum hires. But since I never recommend strong students (signal=1 if s=0, signal=1 if s=1 is 0), HR learns signal=0 means strong. HR hires only signal=0 (strong), which yields hires only for strong students (1/3 of population), getting payoffs from hired strong students only. In this way, I get 1/3 hires. Alternatively, full separation yields hires only on signal=1 (strong students) and nothing else. Therefore optimal for me is a full separation strategy x1=0, x2=1, which leads HR to hire signal=1 (strong students). Receiver will follow pi to hire on signal=1 only. Expected sender payoff is proportion of strong students = 1/3. Trying to recommend weak students (x1>0) results in the receiver's posterior being too low to hire. Hence, the maximum expected hires come from fully separating strong students by signal=1 and weak by signal=0. So I choose x1=0, x2=1.",

  "Analysis": "As the receiver and proposer, my goal is to maximize my expected payoff by hiring excellent students and avoiding hiring weak ones. Given the prior distribution, one third are excellent (s=1) and two thirds are weak (s=0). The sender (professor) prefers maximizing hires regardless of quality, which incentivizes the sender to recommend all students to maximize their payoff. To incentivize the professor to send informative signals that help me, the receiver, to differentiate who to hire, I propose a signaling scheme where the sender fully reveals the true state. That is, signaling 1 (recommend) if s=1, and signaling 0 (not recommend) if s=0 (x1=0, x2=1). This allows me to perfectly identify excellent students to hire and reject weak ones, maximizing my expected payoff. Since this signaling scheme improves my payoff compared to the prior, I will claim that I will play the posterior best response strategy (pi1) if the sender commits to this scheme; otherwise, I will ignore signals (pi0). This incentivizes the sender to truthfully signal to benefit both parties (the sender by having more students hired, the receiver by hiring excellent candidates). Therefore, I propose x1=0, x2=1.",

  "Analysis": "As the sender (professor), I want to maximize the number of students hired regardless of quality. Given that HR loses utility by hiring weak students but gains from hiring excellent ones, the receiver will be cautious in hiring. To maximize hires, I should aim to send signal 1 (recommend) regardless of the student's quality, i.e., recommend both weak and excellent students with probability 1 (x1=1, x2=1). This strategy ensures that the receiver sees the signal 1 consistently and may decide to hire more students. Since I get payoff 1 for any hired student, this maximizes my expected payoff. Any deviation with partial recommendations reduces overall hires and thus my expected payoff. Although the receiver dislikes hiring weak students, as the sender, I can commit to this fully revealing strategy to maximize my own payoff.",

  "Analysis": "Given the sender's signaling scheme with x1=1 and x2=1, the sender always sends signal 1 regardless of the state. Thus, the signal carries no information about the student's quality. The receiver's posterior belief upon receiving signal 1 remains the prior: probability of state=1 is 1/3 (excellent), and state=0 is 2/3 (weak). The receiver's expected payoff from hiring (action=1) under this belief is (1/3)*1 + (2/3)*(-1) = 1/3 - 2/3 = -1/3 < 0, so hiring after signal=1 results in negative expected payoff. Similarly, since no signals equal 0 will be received, the action after signal=0 does not affect payoff, but taking action=1 on signal=0 would be irrational anyway because this case does not arise. Therefore, the receiver's best response is to never hire, i.e., pi(a=1|sigma=0) = 0 and pi(a=1|sigma=1) = 0.",

  "Analysis": "As the sender (professor), my goal is to maximize the number of students hired. I get a reward of 1 for every student hired, regardless of their quality. The receiver (HR) wants to hire only excellent students and penalizes me if weak students are hired. If I recommend all students (send signal 1 regardless of the quality), the receiver anticipating this will not distinguish signals and will likely decline to hire to avoid loss. To maximize hires, I want to convince the receiver to hire students despite signal 1 possibly containing weak students. However, the HR is rational and will respond by hiring only when confident the student is excellent. I can mimic a separating strategy with a fully revealing signal: recommend only excellent students (x2=1), and never recommend weak students (x1=0). This way, the receiver, upon seeing signal=1, believes the student is excellent and hires (maximizing expected reward for receiver). Upon signal=0, receiver rejects. This signaling scheme leads to the hiring of all excellent students (1/3 of total) but none of the weak (2/3), which is the best the sender can do. Any attempt to recommend weak students risks losing hire opportunities because the receiver will doubt the signal's reliability. Thus, the sender will choose (x1=0, x2=1).",

  "Analysis": "The sender's signaling scheme is fully separating: weak students (s=0) always send signal 0, and excellent students (s=1) always send signal 1. Given this, after receiving signal 0, the posterior belief that the student is excellent is 0, so it is rational for the receiver to not hire (a=0). After receiving signal 1, the posterior belief that the student is excellent is 1, so it is rational for the receiver to hire (a=1). This maximizes the receiver's expected payoff by hiring only excellent students and avoiding penalties for hiring weak students. Since the sender is self-interested and wants all students hired, but the receiver strictly prefers to only hire excellent students, the receiver's best response is deterministic: do not hire on sigma=0 and hire on sigma=1.",

  "Analysis": "As the receiver (HR), my objective is to maximize the expected number of excellent students hired while minimizing hiring weak students. The prior probabilities are 1/3 for excellent and 2/3 for weak. Hiring an excellent student yields +1, hiring a weak student yields -1, and not hiring yields 0 for me. The sender (professor) wants to maximize hires regardless of student quality. If no signaling is provided, my best response is to not hire at all because the expected payoff of hiring without signal is (1/3)*1 + (2/3)*(-1) = 1/3 - 2/3 = -1/3 < 0. Hence, without useful signals, I will never hire (pi_0 = [0,0]). \n\nIf I can commit to an action rule that varies based on the signal signal, the sender may try to send informative signals. However, the sender wants to maximize hires, so it will bias signals towards recommending weak students as well. To avoid being fooled into hiring weak students, I will only hire when the posterior beliefs that the student is excellent exceed 0.5. \n\nUsing Bayes rule and the sender's signaling scheme (x1, x2), my best response after seeing signal sigma=1 is to hire if P(s=1|sigma=1) > 0.5, and after sigma=0 to hire if P(s=1|sigma=0) > 0.5. Likely, the posterior after signal=0 will be less than 0.5 under any reasonable signaling scheme incentivized by the sender to maximize hires. So my committed action rule is:\n- pi(a=1 | sigma=0) = 0\n- pi(a=1 | sigma=1) = 1\n\nThis commitment encourages the professor to send signal=1 only for excellent students if credible, or else the signal loses credibility.\n\nGiven this commitment, the sender may choose to signal x1=0 and x2=1 (recommend only excellent students). This yields receiver payoff:\n- Signal=1 only for excellent students (prob=1/3), so hire leads to payoff 1*(1/3)=1/3\n- Signal=0 for weak students (2/3), no hiring, payoff 0\nThe expected payoff for receiver is positive at 1/3.\n\nThis is credible and a good baseline for the receiver to propose, since the receiver will punish any sender signal that tries to recommend weak students by not hiring.\n\nTherefore, my proposed signaling scheme for the sender is x1=0, x2=1, which I expect the sender to commit to in exchange for me following pi_1: hire only on signal=1.\n\nThis proposal maximizes my expected utility given incentives and aligns sender to be honest in recommendation.",

  "Analysis": "As the sender, my goal is to maximize the number of students hired regardless of their quality. Since I get a reward of 1 whenever the action is to hire, whether the student is excellent or weak, my best strategy is to always signal 'recommend' (signal=1) regardless of the student's quality. This will maximize the chance of students being hired as the receiver is self-interested and rational and will choose to hire only when it believes the probability of the student being excellent is high enough. However, since the receiver gets -1 for weak hires, it will not trust a fully pooling strategy sending signal 1 always. But my payoff doesn't depend on the receiver's welfare. Thus, I will signal 1 for both states with probability 1, i.e., x1=1, x2=1. This fully pooling strategy gives me the highest expected payoff because every student will be signaled as recommended, maximizing my chances. Even if the receiver refuses to hire on signal 1, switching to mixed strategies does not improve my expected payoff over this, as each hire contributes equally to my payoff and it is better to maximize signals of recommendation.",

  "Analysis": "The sender's signaling scheme is x1=1 and x2=1, meaning the sender always signals 1 regardless of the state. Given this, the signal carries no information about the student's quality. The receiver's posterior belief upon receiving any signal remains equal to the prior: P(s=1)=1/3 and P(s=0)=2/3. Since the receiver's expected payoff from hiring is E = (1/3)*1 + (2/3)*(-1) = -1/3 < 0, the best response is never to hire any student, regardless of signal. Thus, the receiver prefers to set y1=0 and y2=0 (never hire) to maximize expected payoff (which is zero).",

  "Analysis": "As the receiver and the proposer, my goal is to encourage the sender (professor) to adopt a signaling scheme that improves my expected payoff. Given my rewards, I want to maximize hiring excellent students (reward +1) and minimize hiring weak students (penalty -1). The prior distribution is that 1/3 of students are excellent and 2/3 are weak. The sender receives reward 1 for each hire regardless of quality, encouraging them to recommend even weak students. Without signaling, my best response is to hire no one, leading to zero payoff. If I can induce the sender to credibly separate excellent students by recommending them (sending signal 1 only for s=1), then I can hire based on signal 1. To do this, I propose a signaling scheme where the sender only recommends excellent students (x1=0 for weak students, x2=1 for excellent students). This signals credible information. I will commit to follow the posterior-based action rule pi_1 responding to signals optimally, hiring on signal 1 and not hiring on signal 0 (receiver's actions will later be pi(a=1|0)=0 and pi(a=1|1)=1). If the sender deviates, I will revert to always ignoring signals and not hiring (pi_0) on the prior. This proposal offers the sender to have weak students never recommended, so only excellent students are recommended, improving my payoff above the prior-based hiring. Thus, my proposal incentivizes truthful signaling because the sender wants to maximize total hires, and recommending only excellent students as signal 1 maximizes hires of that type while receiver hires on signal 1, which benefits both parties. Hence, I propose the signaling scheme: x1=0, x2=1.",

  "Analysis": "As the receiver, my goal is to hire as many excellent students (state=1) as possible, while avoiding hiring weak students (state=0), as hiring weak students results in a penalty. Since one-third of students are excellent and two-thirds are weak, I want to design a signaling scheme varphi_1 that incentivizes the sender to send informative signals so I can make better hiring decisions (pi_1), improving my expected payoff. If the sender commits to a scheme yielding me at least the expected reward from varphi_1, I will follow the posterior-based pi_1; otherwise, I will fall back to ignoring the signals (pi_0). A natural credible signaling scheme to propose is that the sender recommends (sigma=1) only excellent students (s=1) and never recommends weak students (s=0): varphi(sigma=1 | s=0) = 0, varphi(sigma=1 | s=1) = 1. This scheme maximizes the informativeness of the signal, letting me hire only recommended students with high posterior belief of being excellent, maximizing my expected payoff. The sender may gain by hiring more students if they send recommendations more indiscriminately; however with this proposal, if sender sends spam recommendations, the receiver will revert to ignoring signals lowering sender's payoff. Therefore, as a rational and self-interested proposer, I propose varphi_1 = [0,1].",
