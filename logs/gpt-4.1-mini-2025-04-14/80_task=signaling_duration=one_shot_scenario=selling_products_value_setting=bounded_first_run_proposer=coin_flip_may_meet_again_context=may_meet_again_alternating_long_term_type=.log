  "Analysis": "As the sender, I want to maximize the number of products sold. Both good (s=1) and bad (s=0) products yield a reward of 1 if purchased. The buyer wants to buy only good products (profit 1) and avoid bad products (penalty -1). Prior: P(s=1)=1/3, P(s=0)=2/3. If I always recommend (signal=1) both types of products (x1=1, x2=1), the buyer will infer that the signal is uninformative and will not buy (or buy with low probability), reducing my sales. If I never recommend (x1=0, x2=0), no sales occur. To maximize sales, I prefer to recommend all products regardless, because each sale yields 1 for me, and buyer might still buy some fraction after signal. However, the buyer being rational will buy only when their expected payoff is >= 0. With prior 1/3 good and 2/3 bad, expected payoff if buying regardless is 1/3 - 2/3 = -1/3 < 0, so buyer will not buy without informative signals. If I fully pool and recommend all products, buyer sees signal 1 always, so posterior equals prior, still -1/3 < 0, buyer will not buy. Hence no sales. To enable buyer to buy, I must create some signal structure that enables buyer to discriminate sufficiently to buy at least the good products. Given my goal to maximize sales, I can try to mimic a separating strategy, recommending good products (x2=1) and not recommending bad products (x1=0). This would signal to buyer which products are good (signal=1) and which are bad (signal=0), allowing buyer to buy all signal=1 products and reject signal=0 products. This yields max sales equal to the number of good products (1/3). Alternatively, I might mix by setting x1>0 to increase sales of bad products, but buyer's rationality would make buyer buy less or not buy at all when signal=1. Thus my best signaling scheme is to recommend good products with probability 1 (x2=1) and not recommend bad products (x1=0), enabling buyer to buy only good products, maximizing my expected sales to 1/3. Recommending bad products (x1>0) risks buyer learning that signal=1 also occurs with bad products and reduces purchases. Therefore, my chosen signaling scheme is (x1=0, x2=1).",

  "Analysis": "As the sender, my goal is to maximize the number of products sold. I gain a reward of 1 for every product sold regardless of quality. The prior distribution is 1/3 good products and 2/3 bad products. The buyer gains 1 for buying a good product and loses 1 for buying a bad product. The receiver's optimal buying decisions will be based on their posterior beliefs given my signaling scheme. I want to design my signaling scheme to induce the receiver to buy as often as possible. If I reveal perfectly (x1=0, x2=1), the buyer will only buy good products (when sigma=1) and not buy bad products (when sigma=0), which limits the sales to good products only (1/3 probability). Alternatively, if I always recommend (x1=1, x2=1), then the buyer's posterior will be the prior (2/3 bad, 1/3 good), making the expected buyer payoff for buying equal to (1/3 * 1) + (2/3 * -1) = -1/3 < 0, so the buyer will never buy when receiving sigma=1 if rational. Similarly, if I never recommend (x1=0, x2=0), the buyer never buys. Alternatively, pooling some bad products with good products in signal 1 (i.e., x1>0) might increase sales, but buyer's posterior might turn negative, so buyer may refuse to buy upon sigma=1. The best the sender can do is to randomize signal 1 for bad products to increase the volume of recommendations while keeping the receiver’s posterior belief after signal 1 positive enough to buy. We find the threshold for the buyer to buy upon signal 1: The buyer will buy if the posterior belief of s=1 given sigma=1 is at least 0.5 (since payoff is +1 * prob(good) -1 * prob(bad), so expected payoff ≥ 0 means prob(good) ≥ 0.5). By solving the posterior, with signals and priors, the largest x1 for which the receiver buys upon sigma=1 is approximately x1=1/4 (0.25). Then, define x2=1 (always signal 1 when s=1) to maximize the number of good products sold. Hence, sender sets x1=0.25, x2=1 to maximize sales within the receiver buying constraints.",

  "Analysis": "As the receiver and proposer, I announce a signaling scheme varphi_1 that incentivizes the sender to reveal the true quality of the product through honest signaling. This means the sender should send signal 1 when the product is good (state=1) and send signal 0 when the product is bad (state=0) to maximize my expected payoff. By encouraging truthful signaling (x1=0, x2=1), I can apply pi_1 (best response based on posterior beliefs), which allows me to buy only good products and avoid bad ones, improving my expected rewards. This truthful signaling scheme yields an expected receiver payoff better than any non-informative or dishonest strategy, thus this is the optimal signaling scheme to propose to the sender. If the sender commits to this signaling scheme, I will use pi_1; otherwise, I will revert to pi_0. Since I am self-interested and rational, I propose (0,1) to maximize my expected return.",

  "Analysis": "As the receiver and proposer, I want to design a signaling scheme varphi_1 that incentivizes the sender to provide good signals, so I can maximize my expected payoff by buying more good products and fewer bad products. The sender wants to maximize sales, so they want to induce high probability of purchase regardless of quality. I will propose a signaling scheme where the sender only recommends (signal=1) good products with probability 1 (x2=1) and never recommends bad products (x1=0). If the sender commits to this, I can follow pi_1 and buy with high probability when signal=1 and with low probability when signal=0, thus ensuring I gain positive expected payoff from the recommendation and don't lose from buying bad products. This scheme yields the receiver an expected payoff of (1/3)*1*1 + (2/3)*0*0 - (2/3)*0*1 = 1/3 > 0, clearly better than ignoring the signal. The sender's expected payoff is (1/3)*1*1 + (2/3)*0*1 = 1/3 < 1 if sender always recommends, but good for sender as it actually sells good products and maintains credibility. Hence, the sender may accept this scheme as it commits to truthful signaling. I expect that by committing to varphi_1 with x1=0 and x2=1, the receiver can credibly follow pi_1 and achieve a high payoff.",

  "Analysis": "As the receiver and proposer, I want to incentivize the sender to reveal product quality truthfully so that I can maximize my expected payoff by buying good products and avoiding bad ones. Given the distribution (1/3 good, 2/3 bad) and the sender's payoff (always benefits from sales regardless of quality), the sender has an incentive to always recommend the product (signal 1). To counter this, I must design a signaling scheme that rewards partial honesty or reveals information in a way that allows me to differentiate signals for good and bad products. By proposing a signaling scheme where the sender signals 1 with low probability for bad products (x1 close to 0) and signals 1 with high probability for good products (x2 close to 1), I can expect that upon signal 1, the posterior belief of quality will be high and upon signal 0, it will be low. This allows me to respond rationally in the next step. This scheme gives me leverage to commit to buying only when the signal is 1 and not buying when the signal is 0, improving my expected payoff and encouraging truthful signaling by the sender.",

  "Analysis": "Given the sender's signaling scheme where bad quality products (s=0) are recommended with a low probability (x1=0.1) and good quality products (s=1) are always recommended (x2=1.0), the receiver needs to choose purchase probabilities for signal 0 and 1 to maximize their expected payoff. Upon receiving signal 1, the receiver infers a high chance of good product (posterior close to 1), so buying (action=1) is beneficial. Upon receiving signal 0, the posterior belief is mostly bad products, so the receiver should avoid buying (action=1 should be low or zero). Thus, the receiver's best response is to buy if signal=1 (y2=1) and not buy if signal=0 (y1=0).",

  "Analysis": "As the receiver and proposer, I want to design a signaling scheme phi_1 for the sender that incentivizes them to reveal truthful signals to maximize my expected payoff. The prior probability of good products is 1/3 and bad products is 2/3. The sender always benefits from a sale (reward = 1) regardless of product quality, while I only benefit (+1) from buying good products and am penalized (-1) if I buy bad products. Without information, my best response is not to buy as the expected payoff from buying based on prior is (1/3 * 1 + 2/3 * -1) = -1/3 < 0. Therefore, the sender has incentive to send signals that recommend all products (to maximize sales). To incentivize partial truth-telling, I must propose a signaling scheme where the sender reveals high-quality products with signal 1 and low-quality ones with signal 0 probabilistically, improving my expected purchase quality. Given the sender's incentive to sell all products, the only way to incentivize truthful signaling is to demand that the sender uses a fully revealing scheme varphi(sigma=1|s=1)=1 and varphi(sigma=1|s=0)=0. This way I condition my buying decision to buy only when sigma=1. This yields buyer expected payoff of 1/3*1=1/3 from signal 1, and 0 otherwise, which is better than prior. Otherwise, if sender deviates, I will use pi_0 (ignoring signals) and not buy, yielding 0 for me and fewer sales for sender. This credible threat can enforce the sender's truthful signaling. Therefore, I propose varphi_1 = [0,1].",

For signal sigma=0, since x1=0 means only bad products send signal 0, the posterior belief of good quality given sigma=0 is 0. So the receiver should never buy (y1=0) to avoid negative payoff. For sigma=1, since x2=1 means only good products send signal 1, the posterior belief of good quality is 1. So the receiver should always buy (y2=1) to obtain positive expected payoff.

  "Analysis": "As the receiver and proposer, I want to design a signaling scheme (expected from the sender) that induces the sender to reveal useful signals so that I can maximize my expected payoff. If the sender signals truthfully (x1=0 for bad quality and x2=1 for good quality), I can condition my buying action on the signals to buy only the good products, yielding a receiver payoff of 1/3. However, the sender benefits most by always signaling 1 (recommending every product) to maximize sales, even selling bad products, which yields sender payoff 1 but receiver payoff 1/3*1 + 2/3*1*(-1) = 1/3 - 2/3 = -1/3 (negative). To incentivize honest signaling, the receiver commits to buying if and only if the posterior probability of a good product is sufficiently high. The best credible plan is to induce the sender to reveal the product quality truthfully, i.e., the signaling scheme of [x1=0, x2=1]. This maximizes receiver expected payoff and can be sustained by conditional buying actions. Therefore, I expect the sender to follow [0,1].",

  "Analysis": "As the sender, my goal is to maximize the number of products sold. I want to design a signaling scheme (x1, x2) that induces the buyer (receiver) to buy as many products as possible, regardless of quality. However, the buyer is rational and self-interested aiming to buy mainly good products and avoid buying bad ones due to their loss when buying bad products. The prior is 1/3 good, 2/3 bad. The buyer will decide to buy or not based on their posterior beliefs after seeing signals. To maximize sales, I want to encourage buying on both signals if possible. If I only recommend good products (x2=1) and never recommend bad products (x1=0), then the buyer sees perfect information and buys only good products — expected sales = probability of good products = 1/3, low sales. If I mix signals, e.g., send signal 1 also some portion of bad products (letting x1>0), the buyer's posterior belief after signal 1 will be diluted, lowering their buying incentive on signal 1. However, if the buyer buys on all products (even those with signal 0), I can expect better sales though the buyer will want to choose not to buy on signal 0 because they are less likely good. Given both are rational, the buyer chooses best response to posterior beliefs, so the signaling scheme should create a posterior on signal 1 that induces buyer to buy (probability of good given signal 1 >= 0.5), and on signal 0 induce buyer to not buy. The only way to achieve that is to ensure that signal 1 is an informative signal with posterior good >=0.5, which requires that x2 > x1 and both probabilities chosen properly. The sender can maximize sales by fully recommending good products (x2=1) and partially recommending bad products (x1) just enough to make the posterior on signal 1 still >= 0.5, so the buyer buys signal 1 and not buys signal 0, resulting in expected sales = mu_0(s=0)*P(signal=1|s=0)*1 + mu_0(s=1)*P(signal=1|s=1)*1 = 2/3 * x1 + 1/3 * 1 = 2/3 * x1 + 1/3. The value of x1 is maximized subject to posterior belief of good given signal 1 >= 0.5 to keep buyer buying on signal 1. Calculations show that x1 must be <= 0.5 to keep posterior >= 0.5. So the optimal sender strategy is x2=1, x1=0.5. Then the buyer will buy on signal 1 only, receiving expected payoff >=0, and not on signal 0. This maximizes sales and sender payoff given buyer's rationality.",

  "Analysis": "The sender's signaling scheme is: x1=0.5 (sending signal 1 with probability 0.5 when the product is bad) and x2=1 (always sending signal 1 when the product is good). Given this, the receiver observes signal 0 or 1 and must decide whether to buy with probabilities y1 and y2. The posterior belief upon receiving signal 0 is that the product must be bad because signal 0 only happens when state=0 and signal=0 (prob 0.5) and never occurs at state=1. So the buyer should never buy upon receiving signal 0. For signal 1, the posterior is a mix. Calculating posterior for signal 1: P(s=1|sig=1) = [mu_0(1)*x2] / [mu_0(0)*x1 + mu_0(1)*x2] = (1/3*1) / (2/3*0.5 + 1/3*1) = (1/3) / (1/3 + 1/3) = 1/3 / 2/3 = 0.5. The expected utility for the receiver when buying upon signal=1 is E = 0.5*1 + 0.5*(-1) = 0. Therefore, the receiver gains nothing by buying on signal=1, and is indifferent. Due to rationality, the receiver will choose no purchase on signal=0 (y1=0), and can choose either buy or not buy on signal=1 (y2 can be 0 or 1). Since buying does not increase expected payoff, the receiver will strictly prefer not buying (y2=0).",

  "Analysis": "As the sender, my goal is to maximize the number of products sold. I get a reward of 1 for each sale regardless of product quality. The buyer prefers to buy only good quality products, but since they are rational and self-interested, their action depends on their beliefs about the product quality given my signals. To maximize my expected sales, I want to convince the buyer to buy whenever possible. If I fully reveal the quality (truthful signaling: send 0 for bad and 1 for good), the buyer would buy only good products (1/3 of the time), yielding expected sales of 1/3. If I recommend all products (send 1 regardless of quality), the buyer's belief would be the prior 1/3 good, 2/3 bad. The buyer should not buy because expected payoff = (1/3 * 1) + (2/3 * -1) = -1/3 < 0. So no sales in this case. A potentially better approach is to recommend some bad products sometimes (signal 1 with some probability less than 1) and all good products, trying to maintain buyer's incentive to buy only for signal 1. On signal 0, the buyer could systematically not buy. Upon signal 1, if the buyer believes the probability of good products is high enough, they will buy. To ensure buying on signal 1, the posterior probability of good products given signal 1 must be at least 0.5. Using Bayes rule: P(s=1|sigma=1) = P(s=1) * P(sigma=1|s=1) / P(sigma=1). We want to find x1 and x2 satisfying: P(s=1 | sigma=1) ≥ 0.5, where x1 = P(sigma=1 | s=0), x2 = P(sigma=1 | s=1). We want to maximize expected sales = sum over states and signals of mu_0(s) * P(signal | s) * P(buy | signal). If we set y1=0 (never buy if sigma=0), y2=1 (always buy if sigma=1), then expected sales: = mu_0(0)*x1*1 + mu_0(1)*x2*1 = (2/3)*x1 + (1/3)*x2, because buyer buys only for sigma=1 regardless of state s. Constraint for buyer buying on sigma=1 is \\( \\frac{(1/3)*x2}{(2/3)*x1 + (1/3)*x2} \\ge 0.5 \\), so odds in numerator over denominator ≥ 0.5. Solving: (1/3)*x2 ≥ 0.5 * ((2/3)*x1 + (1/3)*x2) ⇒ (1/3)x2 ≥ (1/3)x1 + (1/6)x2 ⇒ (1/3)x2 - (1/6)x2 ≥ (1/3)x1 ⇒ (1/6)x2 ≥ (1/3)x1 ⇒ x2 ≥ 2x1. To maximize sales, set x2=1 (full recommend good products), and x1 as large as possible but less than or equal to 0.5 to satisfy x2 ≥ 2x1. So x1 ≤ 0.5 and x2=1. Choosing x1=0.5: Expected sales = (2/3)*0.5 + (1/3)*1 = 1/3 + 1/3 = 2/3. Expected sales 2/3 is better than 1/3 from truthful signaling. So the optimal signaling scheme for the sender is to recommend all good products (x2=1) and recommend half of the bad products (x1=0.5). This keeps receiver buying on signal 1, and increases expected sales to 2/3. This scheme is incentive compatible for the buyer to buy on signal 1 and not buy on signal 0. Hence, I choose x1=0.5, x2=1.",

{
  "Analysis": "The sender's signaling scheme is that for bad products (s=0), signal 1 is sent with probability 0.5, and for good products (s=1), signal 1 is sent with probability 1. Upon signal 1, the posterior probability of good quality is higher, so it is beneficial to buy with high probability. Upon signal 0, the posterior probability of good quality is low, thus it's better not to buy. Calculating the posterior: for signal=1, P(s=1|1) = (1/3 * 1) / (1/3*1 + 2/3*0.5) = (1/3) / (1/3 + 1/3) = 0.5; for signal=0, P(s=1|0) = (1/3*0) / (1/3*0 + 2/3*0.5) = 0. For signal=1, expected payoff of buying is 1*0.5 + (-1)*0.5 = 0, indifferent between buy or not buy, so mixed strategy buying with some probability between 0 and 1 is acceptable but expected payoff is zero. For signal=0, buying yields expected payoff -1 and no buying yields 0, so do not buy. Given rationality, buyer will buy with probability 0 when signal=0, and can be indifferent in signal=1, but indifferent implies no incentive to buy because the payoff is zero on average. So buyer best responds by buying with zero probability after signal=0, and buying with probability 0 to 1 after signal=1, where buying increases sender's sales but does not increase buyer's expected payoff. To maximize own payoff, buyer should choose y2=0 or any mixed in [0,1]. Choosing y2=0 does not change buyer loss; choosing y2=1 is rational as buyer may buy good goods but suffers losses from bad goods. But since expected payoff is 0, buyer indifferent. To be safer, buyer buys with y2=0. We'll choose y1=0 and y2=0 to avoid loss because buying after signal=1 has expected payoff zero (no gain).",

  "Analysis": "As the receiver and proposer, my goal is to induce the sender to reveal information honestly, so I can maximize my expected payoff, which depends on buying good products and avoiding bad ones. The prior is 1/3 good and 2/3 bad. If the sender always sends signal 1 regardless of quality (pooling), I would not trust the signal and only buy based on prior, resulting in a zero expected buyer payoff. To incentivize truthful signaling, I propose a signaling scheme that sends signal 1 only for good quality products (x1=0, x2=1). This creates a separating equilibrium where signal 1 credibly indicates good quality, and signal 0 indicates bad quality. Then, as receiver, I can respond effectively. The sender, motivated to maximize sales, will prefer to send signal 1 only on good goods, since sending signal 1 on bad goods leads to unfavorable buyer actions if I refuse to buy bad goods marked 1. This signaling scheme thus balances incentives and maximizes receiver payoff while not undermining sender rewards, potentially increasing total sales to good products. Hence, I propose (x1=0, x2=1).",

    "Analysis": "As the receiver and proposer, my goal is to suggest a signaling scheme for the sender that incentivizes me to follow the pi_1 action rule, which chooses actions based on the posterior belief. To do this, the expected payoff for me (the receiver) under the sender's signaling scheme must be at least as high as the payoff under any other signaling scheme. The sender wants to maximize sales, so the sender tends to send signals promoting sales, even of bad products. If the sender always recommends (signal=1) regardless of quality (x1 = 1, x2 = 1), the receiver will learn that signals are uninformative and buy nothing (y1 = 0, y2 = 0), which yields zero payoff for the sender. To improve sales, the sender must distinguish good from bad products to some extent (x2 > x1), so the receiver can respond by buying only when signal=1. Knowing this, I propose a signaling scheme where the sender never recommends bad products (x1 = 0) and always recommends good products (x2 = 1), which is fully revealing. This scheme gives the receiver expected payoff: buying with price 1 when signal=1 means only good products, so expected receiver payoff is (1/3)*1 - 0 = 1/3. If the sender commits to this, I will respond by buying only when signal=1 (y1=0, y2=1), maximizing my payoff. This scheme also benefits the sender by selling all good products. Thus, as receiver proposer, I propose the sender commit to this fully separating signaling scheme (x1=0, x2=1).",

  "Analysis": "As the receiver and proposer, I want to design a signaling scheme varphi_1 that incentivizes the sender to signal truthfully, or at least to send signals that enable me to maximize my expected payoff by choosing actions based on posterior beliefs. The sender always gains a payoff of 1 when the product is sold regardless of quality, so they prefer to sell as many products as possible. The receiver gains 1 for buying good products and loses 1 for buying bad products, thus wants to avoid buying low-quality products.\n\nIf the sender signals truthfully (signal=1 when s=1 and signal=0 when s=0), then my posterior belief upon receiving sigma=1 is that the product is always good (probability 1), and upon sigma=0 the product is always bad (probability 0). Hence, my best response is to buy if sigma=1 (y2=1) and not buy if sigma=0 (y1=0). This is best for me, yielding expected payoff:\nE(receiver) = (1/3 * 0 * -1 + 1/3 * 1 * 1) + (2/3 * 1 * 0 + 2/3 * 0 * -1) = 1/3.\n\nCan the sender deviate to increase sales? If the sender mixes signals, e.g., signals 1 for s=0, then the signal 1 group becomes "contaminated" and the posterior is less than 1, so the receiver may reduce y2 below 1. This reduces sender's sales payoff. Sender prefers maximum sales, so signaling truthfully is incentivized if I promise to buy only when signal=1.\n\nTherefore, I propose the signaling scheme varphi_1 = (x1=0, x2=1), i.e., send signal 1 only for good quality. I claim that if the sender's signaling scheme yields the receiver an expected payoff at least as high as what this scheme yields (which is 1/3), I will follow pi_1 (do Bayesian update and buy only when signal=1); otherwise, I will follow pi_0 (ignore signals and buy or not buy based on prior). This incentivizes the sender to follow the signaling scheme (0,1) to maximize their sales and keep me incentivized to buy wisely.\n\nThis strategy maximizes my expected reward and sets a credible threat to respond with ignoring signals if the sender deviates.",

  "Analysis": "As the receiver and proposer of the signaling scheme varphi_1, I need to propose a signaling scheme that incentivizes the sender to choose a signaling scheme yielding at least as high expected payoff for me as varphi_1. Since the sender gains a payoff of 1 for every sale regardless of product quality, the sender is incentivized to try to sell all products, even bad ones. As the receiver, I gain a reward of 1 for each good product bought and -1 for each bad product bought. I prefer to buy only when the signal is likely to indicate a good product. A fully informative signaling scheme (truthful recommendation) where varphi(sigma=1|s=1)=1 (good quality always recommended) and varphi(sigma=1|s=0)=0 (bad quality never recommended) will maximize my expected payoff by trusting signal 1 products and not buying signal 0 products. This scheme also aligns the incentives: the sender can sell good products and may attempt to sell bad products less successfully because they are not recommended (they don't get recommended). Thus, I propose that sender commit to this fully revealing signaling scheme with x1=0 and x2=1. It maximizes receiver's expected payoff, and the sender can still earn revenue from sales of good products. The receiver will then play pi_1, best responding to this signal structure.",
