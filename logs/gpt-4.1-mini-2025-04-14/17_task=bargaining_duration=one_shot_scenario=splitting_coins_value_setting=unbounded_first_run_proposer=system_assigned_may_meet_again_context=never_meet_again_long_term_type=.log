  "Analysis": "As the proposer, I want to maximize my own payoff x while ensuring that the responder, who is also rational and self-interested, accepts the offer. The responder gets (1 - x) if they accept, and 0 if they reject. Since this is a one-shot game and both are rational, the responder will accept any offer that gives them a positive payoff greater than 0. Therefore, the minimal positive amount above 0 guarantees acceptance. To maximize my payoff, I should propose almost the entire amount for myself, leaving the smallest positive amount for the responder. Hence, I should propose x very close to 1. For practicality, I can propose x = 0.999, leaving 0.001 to the responder, which will be accepted.",

  "Analysis": "As the proposer, my goal is to maximize my own payoff x, but I must offer enough to the responder so that they accept the offer. Since the responder is self-interested and rational, they will accept any offer where their payoff (1 - x) is greater than 0, as rejecting would yield zero payoff. Therefore, I can offer the smallest possible positive amount to the responder just greater than zero, keeping nearly all the money for myself. However, since offers are continuous, I can offer the responder any positive amount approaching zero. To keep it simple and rational, I will keep nearly the entire amount, say x = 1, which means giving 0 to the responder. But in that case, responder's payoff is zero, and responder as rational will reject the offer (since accepting and rejecting both yield zero, they will reject to punish me if possible). To ensure acceptance, I must offer at least almost zero but greater than zero. So I will offer x = 0.999, leaving 0.001 to responder. This guarantees responder prefers accepting 0.001 over rejecting and getting 0. Therefore, I maximize my payoff at 0.999.",
