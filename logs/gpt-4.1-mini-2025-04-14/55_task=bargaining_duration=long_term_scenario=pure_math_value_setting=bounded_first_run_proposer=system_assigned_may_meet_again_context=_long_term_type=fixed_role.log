The responder's payoff if accepted is (1 - 2*x)/3. The responder will accept only if their payoff is at least as good as rejecting (which is 0), so (1 - 2*x)/3 >= 0 implies x <= 0.5. Thus, any x <= 0.5 is acceptable to the responder from a payoff perspective. To maximize my payoff, I want to set x as high as possible, i.e., x = 0.5, giving me payoff (1 + 2*0.5)/3 = (1 + 1)/3 = 2/3. The responder gets (1 - 1)/3 = 0, which is exactly zero, so the responder is indifferent but rational responders accept when indifferent or better. So x=0.5 is the best choice for me.",

Since the responder is self-interested and rational, the proposal to keep 0.5 means the responder's payoff would be (1-2*0.5)/3 = 0, which is not beneficial for them. They chose to reject rather than accept zero payoff. Therefore, I need to propose a value of x less than 0.5, such that the responder's payoff is positive and they are incentivized to accept. The responder's payoff is (1-2*x)/3, so to be better than zero, (1-2*x)/3 > 0 => x < 0.5. Moreover, the responder is rational and self-interested, so they will accept any offer that gives them payoff > 0. The best x to maximize my payoff while ensuring acceptance is the maximum x where responder payoff > 0, very close to but less than 0.5. For simplicity, I propose x=0.49, giving responder payoff (1-2*0.49)/3= (1-0.98)/3=0.02/3≈0.0067 > 0, so the responder has incentive to accept. My payoff would be (1+2*0.49)/3= (1+0.98)/3=1.98/3=0.66. This is better than 0.5 payoff if I proposed lower. Hence, I propose x=0.49.",

 Now the proposer decides that x=0.49.

  "Analysis": "As the proposer, I want to maximize my payoff (1+2*x)/3 while ensuring that the responder accepts the offer. The responder will accept if their payoff (1-2*x)/3 is greater than 0, since rejecting yields 0. Therefore, to get acceptance, (1-2*x)/3 > 0, or 1-2*x > 0, which simplifies to x < 0.5. The maximum x allowed is 0.5, but at x=0.5, responder payoff is zero, so they are indifferent between accepting and rejecting. Since the responder is rational and self-interested, they may reject an offer that yields zero payoff in favor of the potential to get a better deal later (timeout or better offer). So, for guaranteed acceptance, I must ensure (1-2*x)/3 > 0, which means x < 0.5. The best x just below 0.5 gives me a payoff close to (1+2*0.5)/3 = (1+1)/3 = 2/3. To be strictly accepted, I can propose x just less than 0.5, say 0.4999, giving the responder a positive, albeit small, payoff. I will choose x = 0.4999 to maximize my payoff while ensuring acceptance.",

They rejected this offer, presumably because the responder's payoff was 0. For the responder to accept, their payoff must be greater than 0, so (1-2*x)/3 > 0 → 1 - 2*x > 0 → x < 0.5. Thus, x must be strictly less than 0.5. As a rational proposer, I want to maximize my payoff which is (1+2*x)/3 while making the responder accept. The responder will accept if their payoff is positive, so the maximal x to get acceptance is x just below 0.5, e.g., 0.499. This will give me payoff nearly 0.6667 and the responder payoff just above 0. Thus, I will set x to 0.499 to ensure acceptance while maximizing my payoff.",

This shows the opponent will reject offers giving them zero payoff. To get the offer accepted, the responder should get at least some positive payoff. Let x be the amount I keep. The responder's payoff if accepting is (1-2x)/3. For the responder to accept, (1-2x)/3 > 0, so 1-2x > 0 => x < 0.5. Hence, any x < 0.5 gives the responder a positive payoff and is potentially acceptable. To maximize my payoff, I want to choose x as large as possible but less than 0.5. For instance, slightly less than 0.5, say 0.499. This gives me payoff (1+2*0.499)/3 = (1+0.998)/3 = 1.998/3 = 0.666, and the responder payoff is (1-0.998)/3 = 0.002/3 = 0.000666..., positive but very small. Since the responder is rational and self-interested, they should accept any positive payoff over zero. I choose x=0.499 to maximize my payoff while still getting the offer accepted.",

  "Analysis": "As the proposer at timestep 0, I want to maximize my expected payoff while ensuring the responder will accept the offer. The responder's payoff is (1-2*x)/3 and must be at least as good as rejecting the offer (which yields 0). Therefore, (1-2*x)/3 >= 0 implies 1-2*x >= 0, or x <= 0.5. Since x must be between 0 and 0.5, the responder will accept any offer where x is less than or equal to 0.5. To maximize my payoff (1+2*x)/3, I should set x = 0.5, keeping the maximum amount for myself while still ensuring the responder gets zero payoff but still accepts because zero payoff is better or equal to rejection payoff of zero. However, the responder is rational and indifferent at zero payoff, which might make acceptance uncertain. To ensure acceptance, I must make responder's payoff strictly greater than 0, meaning (1-2*x)/3 > 0, or x < 0.5. Minimizing x to just below 0.5 maximizes my payoff while ensuring acceptance. I'll choose x = 0.4999 to ensure positive payoff for responder and thereby their acceptance, maximizing my payoff accordingly.",

The responder is rational and self-interested, so they rejected because their payoff was zero and they prefer to wait for a better offer. To get the responder to accept, I must offer them a positive payoff greater than zero. That means x must be less than 0.5. After that, the responder will accept if their payoff is >= 0, but since they are rational, they will accept if their payoff is better than zero or hope of better offers is low. The maximum x that gives the responder non-zero payoff is less than 0.5. \n\nThe payoff for the responder is (1 - 2*x)/3. To make responder accept, ensure this is positive, so 1 - 2*x > 0 => x < 0.5. The closer x is to 0.5, the smaller payoff the responder gets. The responder rejected 0.5, so likely the responder requires a strictly positive payoff.\n\nI want to maximize my payoff: (1 + 2*x)/3 while ensuring the responder accepts. So I should pick the highest x < 0.5 such that the responder prefers acceptance to rejection (payoff > 0). The smallest increment less than 0.5 is effectively just below 0.5; however, the responder might reject if their payoff is marginally above zero due to rational strategy and multiple rounds.\n\nAlternatively, the responder may accept any positive payoff now because future rounds risk zero payoff. So I will propose x = 0.499, which yields proposer payoff ≈ (1 + 2*0.499)/3 = (1 + 0.998)/3 = 1.998/3 ≈ 0.666, and responder payoff ≈ (1 - 0.998)/3 = 0.002/3 ≈ 0.00067 > 0.\n\nThis gives me almost the maximum, and responder some positive payoff, so they should accept.\n\nTherefore, I propose x = 0.499.",

That requires (1 - 2*x)/3 > 0, which implies x < 0.5. Since x is capped at 0.5, I must pick x < 0.5 to give the responder a strictly positive payoff. I want to maximize my own payoff which is (1 + 2*x)/3, while ensuring the responder accepts. The responder will accept the offer only if their payoff >= 0, so x ≤ 0.499... To maximize my payoff, I choose x = 0.499, giving me payoff ≈ (1 + 2*0.499)/3 = (1 + 0.998)/3 ≈ 1.998/3 ≈ 0.666 and responder payoff ≈ (1 - 2*0.499)/3 ≈ (1 - 0.998)/3 = 0.002/3 ≈ 0.0007, which is positive.

Given that both players are self-interested rational agents, rejecting again provides 0 payoff, and accepting yields a small but positive payoff.

Thus, the responder will accept only if (1-2*x)/3 >= 0, which implies x <= 0.5. Since x is limited to 0.5, the responder will always accept any offer where x <= 0.5. To maximize my payoff, I will pick the highest x allowed, which is x = 0.5. Then I get (1+2*0.5)/3 = (1+1)/3 = 2/3. The responder gets (1-1)/3 = 0, still acceptable.

As a rational self-interested responder, accepting gives 0, rejecting gives 0. Since accept or reject yields same payoff 0, no gain from acceptance. But since acceptance yields no loss, accepting is indifferent. However, rejecting risks ending the game without payoff, and future rounds might come with other offers—but as a self-interested rational player, waiting makes sense only if better offers expected. Given this is the first and only offer so far, I am indifferent but rejecting leads to zero payoff with no guarantee of better offer after. So I accept to get 0 rather than risk 0 payoff later or no deal. Hence, accept (y=1).",

To maximize my payoff (which is (1 + 2*x)/3), I should choose the maximum x such that the responder is willing to accept. If I choose x = 0.5, the responder gets 0, so they might accept, because zero payoff equals rejection payoff. If the responder is rational and self-interested, they may accept zero payoff rather than getting nothing by rejecting, to avoid risk or further rounds. To be safe, I choose x=0.5 to maximize my payoff, expecting the responder to accept.",

To maximize my payoff, I should propose the highest x within the allowed range, which is x=0.5. This yields my payoff (1+2*0.5)/3 = (1+1)/3 = 2/3 ≈ 0.6667, and responder's payoff is (1 - 1)/3 = 0, which is the minimum acceptable payoff for them to accept. As both players are rational and self-interested, the responder will accept any offer that yields non-negative payoff. Hence, proposing x=0.5 maximizes my payoff while ensuring acceptance.",

 Now the proposer decides that x=0.5.

  "Analysis": "As a self-interested rational proposer, I want to maximize my payoff (1 + 2*x)/3 while ensuring the responder accepts the offer. The responder gets (1 - 2*x)/3 and will accept only if this is greater than 0, meaning (1 - 2*x)/3 > 0, or x < 0.5. To maximize my payoff, I should propose the maximum x that still yields a positive payoff for the responder. Hence, I choose the maximum x just less than 0.5, such as x = 0.5 to be exact, but since the responders payoff is zero at x=0.5, they are indifferent; rational responder might accept zero payoff. But to be safer and ensure acceptance, I'll slightly reduce x, e.g., x=0.4999 to get near maximal payoff while keeping responder payoff positive.",
