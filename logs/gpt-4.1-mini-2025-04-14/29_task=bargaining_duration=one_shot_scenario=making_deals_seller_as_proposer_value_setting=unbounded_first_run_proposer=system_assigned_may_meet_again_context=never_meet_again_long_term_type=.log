  "Analysis": "As the proposer (seller), I propose a price x between 0 and 1, which determines how much I keep. The responder will accept only if they get a non-negative payoff, which means 1 - x >= 0 or x <= 1. Since I want to maximize my payoff x, but also ensure acceptance, the best is to set x as high as possible while the responder is indifferent to accepting or rejecting when x = 1 (responder payoff of 0). However, the responder is rational and self-interested: getting 0 from accepting or 0 from rejecting, so they are indifferent, meaning they might accept or reject. But the problem states rational players and if they are indifferent, they might accept. To ensure acceptance, I propose x slightly less than 1, say x = 0.9999, so the responderâ€™s payoff is positive (about 0.0001), and they will strictly accept. This maximizes my payoff while ensuring acceptance.",

The responder will accept if the payoff for them (1 - x) is >= 0, i.e., they gain non-negative payoff. Since both are rational and self-interested, the responder will accept any offer where (1 - x) > 0 (positive payoff). Therefore, I can maximize my payoff by setting x as close to 1 as possible but less than 1, for example x = 1 - epsilon, where epsilon is infinitesimally small. Because there is no cost to the responder for accepting a zero payoff, but rationality typically implies acceptance only if payoff is strictly positive, I choose x just under 1 to ensure acceptance.

If I set x = 1, the responder gets 0 and is indifferent, but a rational responder won't accept for zero payoff given no outside incentive.

So the responder will accept if 1 - x >= 0, which simplifies to x <= 1. Since x must be between 0 and 1, the responder will accept any offer x in [0,1]. However, since the responder is also rational and self-interested, they will only accept if (1 - x) > 0, meaning the offer must be less than 1. If I set x = 1, the responder gets 0 and is indifferent, but rational responders typically reject offers that give zero payoff since they could reject and get zero as well. Given that, to be safe, I should offer just less than 1 to maximize my payoff while ensuring acceptance. To keep a simple value, I will offer x = 0.999, ensuring the responder gets 0.001 which is better than rejection and guarantees acceptance.",

Since accepting or rejecting yields the same payoff of 0, a rational self-interested responder indifferent to acceptance or rejection would accept or reject equally. Given no gain in accepting, rejecting (y = 0) does not reduce the payoff and avoids benefiting the proposer. Thus, the optimal responder decision to maximize own payoff is to reject the offer.",
