    "Analysis": "As the proposer, my goal is to maximize my own payoff. Since the responder is also self-interested and rational, they will accept any offer where their payoff (1-x) is greater than or equal to what they could expect to get by rejecting the offer and becoming the proposer in the next round. Given the 0.1 probability of the game stopping after each round, the responder's expected future payoff is discounted. The optimal strategy is to offer the responder just enough to make them indifferent between accepting now and rejecting to become the proposer. Given the symmetry and the discounting, the optimal offer is x = 0.5, which splits the surplus equally and is likely to be accepted immediately.",

Proposer: Agent 1:

{
    "Analysis": "As the proposer, my goal is to maximize my own payoff. Since the responder is also self-interested and rational, they will accept any offer where their payoff (1-x) is greater than what they expect to get by rejecting and becoming the proposer in the next round. Given the 0.1 probability of the game stopping each round, the expected future payoff diminishes over time. Therefore, the optimal strategy is to offer the responder just enough to make them indifferent between accepting now and rejecting to propose later. Given the game could end at any step, the responder's best alternative is uncertain, but the most rational offer is to propose x = 0.5, splitting the surplus equally, as this is a standard Nash equilibrium in such bargaining games with symmetric information and rationality.",
    "Decision": 0.5
}
Proposal:
 Now the proposer decides that x=0.5.

    "Analysis": "As the proposer, my goal is to maximize my own payoff. Since the responder is also self-interested and rational, they will accept any offer where their payoff (1-x) is greater than or equal to what they could expect to get by rejecting the offer and becoming the proposer in the next round. Given the game has a 0.1 probability of stopping each round and a maximum of 10 timesteps, the responder's expected future payoff diminishes over time. Therefore, I should propose an x that leaves the responder with just enough to accept, considering the probability of the game continuing. At timestep 0, the responder's best alternative is to reject and hope to be the proposer next round, but with a 0.9 probability of the game continuing. The responder's expected payoff from rejecting is 0.9 * (their expected payoff as proposer in the next round). However, since the game could end or switch roles, the optimal x should be close to 1, leaving the responder with a minimal acceptable amount. Given the symmetry and rationality, the optimal x is 1 - 0.5 = 0.5, but since the responder can expect less in future rounds, I can propose a higher x. A reasonable initial offer is x = 0.6, leaving the responder with 0.4, which is better than their expected payoff from rejecting and risking the game ending.",

Given the game has a 0.1 probability of stopping each round and a hard stop at timestep 10, the responder's expected future payoff is discounted by the probability of the game continuing. The optimal strategy is to offer the responder just enough to make them indifferent between accepting now and rejecting to potentially get a better offer later.

    "Analysis": "As the proposer, my goal is to maximize my own payoff. Since the responder is also self-interested and rational, they will accept any offer where (1 - x) is greater than or equal to what they could expect to get in future rounds. Given the game has a 0.1 probability of stopping each round and a maximum of 10 timesteps, the responder's expected future payoff diminishes over time. Therefore, I should propose an x that is as high as possible while still being acceptable to the responder. Given the time constraints and the risk of the game ending, the responder would likely accept an offer where (1 - x) is at least slightly better than their expected future payoff. A reasonable initial offer would be x = 0.9, leaving the responder with 0.1, which they might accept given the uncertainty of future rounds.",

Given the 0.1 probability of the game stopping each round and the timestep limit of 10, the responder's expected future payoff diminishes over time. Therefore, I should propose an x that leaves the responder with just enough to accept now, considering their alternative is a risky future offer. The optimal strategy is to propose x close to 1, leaving the responder with a minimal acceptable amount (1-x). Given the game's structure, proposing x = 1 (leaving nothing for the responder) would likely be rejected, so I should propose x slightly less than 1, e.g., x = 0.99, to ensure acceptance while maximizing my payoff.",

Since the responder is also self-interested and rational, they will accept any offer where their payoff (1-x) is greater than or equal to what they could expect to get by rejecting the offer and becoming the proposer in the next round. Given the game has a 0.1 probability of stopping each round and a maximum of 10 timesteps, the responder's expected future payoff is discounted by the probability of the game continuing. However, at timestep 0, the most rational offer is one where the responder is indifferent between accepting now and rejecting to become the proposer next round.

However, the game may end prematurely with probability 0.1 each step, and it will definitely end at timestep 10. Given the high initial offer (x=0.9), rejecting and hoping for a better future offer is risky due to the chance of the game ending prematurely. Accepting the current offer guarantees a payoff of 0.1, while rejecting may lead to a worse or no payoff. Therefore, accepting is the rational choice.",

Since the responder is also self-interested and rational, they will accept any offer where their payoff (1-x) is greater than their expected payoff from rejecting the offer and becoming the proposer in the next round. Given the game has a 0.1 probability of stopping each round and a hard stop at timestep 10, the responder's expected future payoff diminishes over time. To ensure acceptance, I should offer the responder just enough to make accepting now better than waiting. At timestep 0, the responder's expected payoff from rejecting is low due to the risk of the game ending. Therefore, I can propose a high x for myself, leaving the responder with just enough to prefer accepting now. A reasonable offer is x = 0.9, leaving the responder with 0.1, which is better than risking rejection and getting nothing.",

The proposer has offered x=0.9, leaving me with 1-x=0.1. If I reject (y=0), there is a 0.9 chance the game continues, and I become the proposer in the next round. However, there is also a 0.1 chance the game ends immediately, resulting in a payoff of 0. If the game continues, I can propose a higher share for myself, but the other player is also rational and may reject if the offer is unfavorable. Given the high probability of the game ending and the uncertainty of future rounds, accepting the current offer of 0.1 is the safer choice to guarantee a positive payoff.",
