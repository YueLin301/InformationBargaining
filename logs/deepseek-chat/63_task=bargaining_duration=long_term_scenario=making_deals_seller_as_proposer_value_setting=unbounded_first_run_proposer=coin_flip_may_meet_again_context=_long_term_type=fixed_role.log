    "Analysis": "As the proposer (buyer), my goal is to maximize my own payoff. Since the responder (seller) is also self-interested and rational, they will accept any offer where their payoff (1-x) is greater than or equal to what they could expect in future rounds. Given that the game has a finite horizon (timestep 5), backward induction suggests that in the final round, the proposer would offer x=1 (keeping all for themselves), and the responder would accept any positive offer (since rejecting gives them 0). However, to incentivize acceptance earlier, I should offer the smallest amount that the responder would accept. Given that the responder's alternative is potentially getting nothing in future rounds, offering x slightly less than 1 (e.g., x=0.99) ensures they accept (1-x=0.01 > 0). This maximizes my payoff while ensuring acceptance.",

Since the responder is also self-interested and rational, they will accept any offer where their payoff (1-x) is greater than or equal to what they could expect in future rounds. Given that the game has a finite horizon (timestep 5), backward induction suggests that in the final round, the responder would accept any positive offer (since rejecting gives them nothing). Therefore, the optimal strategy is to offer the smallest possible amount that the responder would accept. In the first round, offering x = 1 (keeping all for myself) would be rejected, so the optimal offer is x slightly less than 1, but practically, x = 0.99 ensures the responder gets 0.01, which is better than nothing and they would accept.",

    "Analysis": "As the proposer, my goal is to maximize my own payoff. Since the responder is also self-interested and rational, they will accept any offer where their payoff (1-x) is greater than or equal to what they could expect to get in future rounds. Given that the game has a finite horizon (timestep 5), backward induction suggests that in the final round, the proposer would offer x=1 (keeping all for themselves), and the responder would accept any offer because rejecting would yield nothing. However, to avoid the risk of rejection in earlier rounds, I should offer the smallest amount that the responder would accept immediately. Given the responder's rationality, they would accept any (1-x) > 0. Therefore, I can propose x very close to 1, leaving the responder with just enough to prefer accepting over rejecting. For simplicity and to ensure acceptance, I will propose x=0.99, leaving the responder with 0.01, which is better than nothing.",

    "Analysis": "As the proposer, my goal is to maximize my own payoff. Since the responder is also self-interested and rational, they will accept any offer where their payoff (1-x) is greater than or equal to what they could expect to get in future rounds. Given that the game has a finite horizon (timestep 5), backward induction suggests that in the final round, the proposer would offer the responder the minimum possible amount (close to 0) since the responder has no future rounds to hold out for. Anticipating this, the responder would accept any offer in earlier rounds that is better than what they would get in the final round. Therefore, the optimal strategy is to offer the responder just enough to make them indifferent between accepting now and waiting, which is a minimal amount. However, since the responder's payoff is (1-x), and they would accept any x < 1, the optimal offer is x = 1 - ε, where ε is a very small positive number. In practice, this means offering x very close to 1, leaving the responder with almost nothing, which they would still accept because rejecting gives them 0.",

    "Analysis": "As the proposer, my goal is to maximize my own payoff. Since the responder is also self-interested and rational, they will accept any offer where their payoff (1-x) is greater than or equal to what they could expect in future rounds. Given that the game has a finite horizon (timestep 5), backward induction suggests that in the final round, the proposer would offer x=1, leaving nothing for the responder, who would have no choice but to accept (since rejecting yields 0). Anticipating this, in earlier rounds, the responder would accept any offer where (1-x) > 0. To ensure acceptance and maximize my payoff, I should offer the smallest possible amount that the responder would accept, which is just above 0. However, since the responder is rational and knows that rejecting leads to 0, they would accept any x < 1. Therefore, I can maximize my payoff by offering x very close to 1, but for simplicity and to ensure acceptance, I will offer x=0.99, leaving 0.01 for the responder.",

    "Analysis": "As the proposer, my goal is to maximize my own payoff. Since the responder is also self-interested and rational, they will accept any offer where their payoff (1-x) is greater than or equal to what they could expect to get in future rounds. Given that the game has a finite horizon (timestep 5), backward induction suggests that in the final round, the proposer would offer x=1, leaving nothing for the responder. Anticipating this, the responder would accept any offer in earlier rounds where (1-x) > 0. To maximize my payoff, I should offer the smallest amount that the responder would accept, which is just above 0. However, since the responder is rational, they would accept any (1-x) >= 0. Therefore, I can offer x=1 (or very close to 1) and expect the responder to accept, as rejecting would give them nothing.",

{
    "Analysis": "As the proposer (buyer), my goal is to maximize my own payoff. Since the responder (seller) is also self-interested and rational, they will accept any offer where their payoff (1-x) is greater than or equal to what they could expect in future rounds. Given that the game has a finite horizon (timestep 5), backward induction suggests that in the final round, the proposer would offer x=1 (leaving nothing for the responder), and the responder would accept because rejecting yields nothing. However, to avoid the risk of rejection and ensure immediate acceptance, I should offer the smallest amount that the responder would accept now, which is just above what they could expect in future rounds. Since the responder's best alternative is 0 (if the game ends without consensus), the minimal acceptable offer is x=1 (leaving 0 for the responder). But this would lead to rejection. Therefore, the optimal offer is x slightly less than 1, but practically, x=1 is the equilibrium offer in the final round. Given that this is the first round (timestep 0), I can exploit the finite horizon by offering x=1, knowing that the responder would reject and hope for a better offer in future rounds. However, since both are rational, the responder would anticipate this and accept any x < 1 in the first round to avoid getting nothing. Thus, the optimal offer is x=0.99, leaving 0.01 for the responder, which is better than nothing and ensures acceptance.",

To ensure acceptance, I should offer the smallest x that the responder would accept, which is x = 0, as any x > 0 is better than rejection for the responder. However, since the responder is also rational and self-interested, they would accept x = 0 because rejecting it gives them 0, and accepting gives them 1 - x = 1.
