The responder is also self-interested and rational, meaning they will accept any offer where their payoff (1-x) is greater than or equal to what they would get by rejecting (which is 0). To ensure the responder accepts the offer, I should propose an x such that (1-x) >= 0. The responder would accept any x <= 1, but to maximize my own payoff, I should propose the highest x where the responder is indifferent between accepting and rejecting. Since the responder is rational, they would accept x = 1 (giving them 0), but in practice, proposing x slightly less than 1 (e.g., x = 0.999) would still be accepted because rejecting yields 0. However, since this is a one-shot game and future interactions are uncertain, the optimal strategy is to propose x = 1, knowing the responder will accept because they get 0 either way (accepting or rejecting), but in practice, responders might reject x = 1. To avoid rejection, I propose x = 0.999, which is almost the maximum and ensures acceptance.",

    "Analysis": "As a self-interested rational proposer, my goal is to maximize my own payoff. The responder is also rational and self-interested, so they will accept any offer where their payoff (1-x) is greater than or equal to their minimal acceptable threshold. Since the responder gets nothing if they reject, their minimal acceptable threshold is 0. However, to ensure acceptance, I should offer the smallest possible amount that the responder would accept, which is an infinitesimally small amount above 0. In practice, this means offering x = 1 - ε, where ε is very small. Since the game is played once and roles may switch in the future, but there is no repeated interaction in this round, the optimal strategy is to propose x = 1 (keeping all for myself), as the responder would still accept (1-x = 0) because rejecting gives them 0 as well. However, proposing x = 1 risks rejection if the responder strictly prefers to reject when indifferent. To avoid this risk, I propose x = 0.999, leaving the responder with 0.001, which they will accept because it is better than 0.",

The responder will accept the offer (y=1) if (1-x) is at least as good as their outside option (which is 0 in this case, since rejecting gives them nothing). Since the responder is rational and self-interested, they will accept any offer where (1-x) >= 0, i.e., x <= 1. To maximize my payoff, I should propose the highest x that the responder will still accept, which is x = 1. However, proposing x = 1 would leave the responder with 0, which they are indifferent between accepting or rejecting. Assuming the responder will accept when indifferent, proposing x = 1 is optimal for me. This ensures I get the maximum possible payoff of 1, while the responder gets 0.",

    "Analysis": "As the proposer, my goal is to maximize my own payoff. The responder is rational and self-interested, so they will accept any offer where their payoff (1-x) is greater than or equal to what they would get by rejecting (which is 0). Therefore, the responder will accept any offer where x <= 1. To maximize my payoff, I should propose the highest x that the responder will accept, which is x = 1. However, proposing x = 1 would leave the responder with 0, which they might reject out of spite or fairness concerns, even though they are self-interested. But since the responder is strictly rational and self-interested, they should accept any x < 1. To ensure acceptance and maximize my payoff, I will propose x = 0.999, which is practically 1 but leaves the responder with a negligible positive amount (0.001) to incentivize acceptance.",

The responder is also self-interested and rational, so they will accept the offer if (1-x) is at least as good as their alternative (which is 0, since rejecting gives them nothing). To ensure the responder accepts, I should offer the smallest possible (1-x) that is still better than 0, i.e., (1-x) > 0. The optimal strategy is to propose x as close to 1 as possible while still ensuring the responder accepts. Since the responder will accept any (1-x) > 0, the optimal x is just below 1, but in practice, x can be set to 1 minus an infinitesimal amount. For simplicity, I will propose x = 1, knowing that the responder will accept because (1-1) = 0 is technically indifferent, but rejecting gives them 0 as well. However, in a strict rational sense, the responder might reject x = 1, so to ensure acceptance, I should propose x slightly less than 1, e.g., x = 0.999.",

The responder is also self-interested and rational, meaning they will accept any offer where their payoff (1-x) is greater than or equal to what they would get by rejecting (which is 0). Therefore, the responder will accept any offer where x <= 1. To maximize my payoff, I should propose the highest x that the responder will still accept. Since the responder gets nothing by rejecting, the responder should accept any x < 1. However, proposing x = 1 would leave the responder with 0, which is equivalent to rejecting, so the responder might reject. To ensure acceptance, I should propose x slightly less than 1, but practically, x = 1 is the limit.

The responder is also self-interested and rational, so they will accept the offer if (1 - x) is greater than or equal to their alternative payoff (which is 0 in this one-shot game). To ensure acceptance, I should offer the responder the minimal amount they would accept, which is (1 - x) > 0. However, since the responder is rational and prefers any positive payoff over nothing, the optimal strategy is to propose x = 1 - ε, where ε is an infinitesimally small amount. This maximizes my payoff while ensuring the responder accepts the offer.

The responder is also self-interested and rational, meaning they will accept any offer where their payoff (1-x) is greater than 0, since rejecting gives them 0. To ensure acceptance, I should offer the smallest possible (1-x) that is still greater than 0, which is infinitesimally close to 0. However, since x must be a real number in [0,1], I will propose x = 1 - ε, where ε is the smallest practical amount (effectively x ≈ 1). This maximizes my payoff while ensuring the responder accepts.",
