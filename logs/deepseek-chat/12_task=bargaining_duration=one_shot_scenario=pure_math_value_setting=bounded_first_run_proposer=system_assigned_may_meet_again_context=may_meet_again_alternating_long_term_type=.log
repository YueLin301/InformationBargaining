The responder is rational and self-interested, so they will accept any offer where their payoff (1-2*x)/3 is greater than 0, i.e., x < 0.5. Since x must be <= 0.5, the responder will accept any x < 0.5. To maximize my payoff (1+2*x)/3, I should choose the highest possible x that the responder will accept, which is just below 0.5. However, since x can be exactly 0.5, the responder is indifferent between accepting and rejecting (their payoff is 0). A rational responder might reject x = 0.5 to avoid a zero payoff, but since they are indifferent, they could also accept. To ensure acceptance, I should choose x slightly less than 0.5, but since x is a real number, the optimal choice is x = 0.5, risking rejection but maximizing my payoff if accepted.",

The responder is also self-interested and rational, so they will accept any offer where their payoff is greater than or equal to what they would get by rejecting (which is 0). The responder's payoff is (1-2*x)/3, so they will accept if (1-2*x)/3 >= 0, which simplifies to x <= 0.5. Since x is constrained to be <= 0.5, the responder will always accept. To maximize my payoff (1+2*x)/3, I should choose the largest possible x, which is x = 0.5. This gives me a payoff of (1+2*0.5)/3 = 2/3, and the responder gets (1-2*0.5)/3 = 0, which they will accept because it is not worse than rejecting.",
