    "Analysis": "As a self-interested rational proposer, my goal is to maximize my own payoff. The responder is also self-interested and rational, meaning they will accept any offer where their payoff (1 - x) is greater than what they could expect to receive in future rounds (which is 0 if the game ends without consensus). Since this is the first round (timestep 0) and the game could end after this round, the responder has no incentive to reject an offer where (1 - x) > 0. To maximize my payoff, I should propose the smallest possible (1 - x) that the responder would still accept, which is an infinitesimally small amount above 0. However, since the responder is rational and prefers any positive payoff over nothing, I can propose x = 1 - ε, where ε is an arbitrarily small positive number. In practice, this means proposing x = 1 (or as close to 1 as possible), leaving the responder with almost nothing (but still something). Given the constraints, the optimal proposal is x = 1, leaving the responder with 0, which they would accept because rejecting would give them 0 as well, and accepting at least does not make them worse off.",

In the previous timestep, proposing x = 1 (keeping everything for myself) was rejected by the responder, resulting in zero payoff for both. To avoid another rejection and ensure a positive payoff, I need to propose an x that the responder (also self-interested and rational) would accept. The responder will accept any (1 - x) > 0, as getting something is better than nothing. However, since the responder is rational, they would prefer even a minimal positive amount over rejection.

However, the proposer is also self-interested and rational, and future offers may not be significantly better. Given that 0.001 > 0, the rational choice is to accept the offer.",

    "Analysis": "As the proposer, my goal is to maximize my own payoff. Since the responder is also self-interested and rational, they will accept any offer where their share (1-x) is greater than what they would expect to get in future rounds (which is 0 if the game ends without consensus). Given that the game can terminate after this round (timestep 0), the responder has no incentive to reject an offer where (1-x) > 0. To maximize my payoff, I should offer the smallest possible amount that the responder would still accept. Since the responder would accept any positive amount, I can set x arbitrarily close to 1, leaving the responder with an infinitesimal amount. However, in practice, the smallest meaningful amount is x = 1, but this would leave the responder with 0, which they would reject. Therefore, the optimal strategy is to offer x = 1 - ε, where ε is the smallest positive amount the responder would accept. For simplicity, we can assume ε approaches 0, so x approaches 1. Thus, the optimal offer is x = 1.",

    "Analysis": "As a self-interested rational player, my goal is to maximize my own payoff. In the previous timestep, I proposed x = 1 (keeping all for myself), which was rejected by the responder. Since the responder is also rational and self-interested, they will reject any offer where they receive less than their minimal acceptable amount. To ensure acceptance, I should propose an x where (1 - x) is at least the responder's minimal acceptable amount. Assuming the responder's minimal acceptable amount is epsilon > 0 (since they rejected x = 1, they must accept some positive amount), I should propose x = 1 - epsilon to maximize my payoff while ensuring acceptance. Given the game has a finite horizon (timestep 5), and rejecting offers leads to zero payoffs, the responder has an incentive to accept any positive offer in later rounds. However, since I am the proposer now, I can exploit this by offering the smallest possible positive amount that the responder would accept. Given the structure, I propose x = 0.99 (leaving 0.01 for the responder), which is a minimal positive amount likely to be accepted by a rational responder to avoid zero payoff.",

Since the responder is also self-interested and rational, they will accept any offer where their payoff (1-x) is greater than 0, because rejecting it would give them nothing. To ensure acceptance and maximize my own payoff, I should offer the smallest possible amount that the responder would still accept. Given that the responder is rational, they would accept any x < 1, but in practice, the smallest positive amount is theoretically 0. However, since the responder gets nothing if they reject, they would accept even x = 1 (i.e., 1-x = 0), but this is a edge case. To be safe and ensure acceptance, I can propose x = 0.999, leaving 0.001 for the responder, which is better than nothing for them.",

The responder is also self-interested and rational, so they will accept any offer where their payoff (1-x) is greater than or equal to what they could expect to get by rejecting and waiting for a future offer. Since the game could end at any timestep (up to 5), the responder's best strategy is to accept any positive offer, as rejecting it risks getting nothing if the game ends. Therefore, the optimal strategy is to offer the smallest possible amount that the responder would accept, which is an infinitesimally small positive amount. However, since the responder is rational and knows that rejecting any positive offer risks getting nothing, they will accept any x < 1. Thus, I can maximize my payoff by proposing x = 1 - ε, where ε is an arbitrarily small positive number.

Since the payoff is the same in both cases, and rejecting does not harm the proposer (they still get nothing if I reject), I am indifferent. However, since the game may continue to future timesteps (up to 5), rejecting now could signal to the proposer that they need to offer a more favorable split in future rounds to reach consensus. But since the current offer is already the worst possible for me, rejecting does not change my payoff and may incentivize a better offer later. Thus, I choose to reject.",

    "Analysis": "As a self-interested rational player, my goal is to maximize my own payoff. In the previous step, proposing x = 1.0 was rejected, resulting in zero payoff for both. To avoid another rejection, I need to propose an x that the responder (agent 0) will accept. Since agent 0 is also self-interested and rational, they will accept any offer where (1 - x) > 0, as rejecting gives them 0. The minimal acceptable offer for agent 0 is any x < 1. To maximize my payoff, I should propose the highest x that agent 0 will accept, which is just under 1.0. However, since x must be <= 1, the optimal x is 1.0, but this was already rejected. Therefore, I must propose x slightly less than 1.0 to ensure acceptance.

    "Analysis": "As the proposer, my goal is to maximize my own payoff. Since the responder is also self-interested and rational, they will accept any offer where their payoff (1-x) is greater than or equal to what they could expect to get by rejecting the offer (which is 0, since rejection leads to no payoff). Therefore, the optimal strategy is to offer the responder the smallest possible amount they would accept, which is just above 0. However, since the responder is rational and knows that rejecting the offer leads to 0, they would accept any positive amount. Thus, I can maximize my payoff by offering x = 1 - ε, where ε is an infinitesimally small positive number. In practice, this means offering x = 1 (keeping all for myself), but since the responder would reject x = 1 (as 1-x = 0), the optimal offer is x = 0.99 (keeping 0.99 for myself and offering 0.01 to the responder), which the responder would accept because 0.01 > 0.",

    "Analysis": "As the proposer, my goal is to maximize my own payoff. Since the responder is also self-interested and rational, they will accept any offer where their payoff (1 - x) is greater than or equal to what they could expect to get by rejecting the offer (which is 0, since rejection leads to no payoff). Therefore, the optimal strategy is to offer the responder the smallest possible amount they would accept, which is just above 0. However, since the responder is rational and knows that rejecting the offer gives them nothing, they would accept any positive amount. Thus, I can maximize my payoff by keeping almost the entire amount for myself and offering the responder an infinitesimally small amount. In practice, this means offering x = 1 - ε, where ε is a very small positive number. For simplicity, I can set x = 1 (keeping everything for myself), but this risks rejection. A safer choice is x = 0.99, leaving 0.01 for the responder, which they would accept because it is better than nothing.",

    "Analysis": "As a self-interested rational player, my goal is to maximize my own payoff. Since I am the proposer, I need to choose an amount x that the responder will accept, as rejection would result in zero payoff for both. The responder is also rational and self-interested, so they will accept any offer where (1-x) > 0, because getting something is better than nothing. However, to maximize my payoff, I should propose the smallest possible (1-x) that the responder would still accept. Given that the responder is rational, they would accept any (1-x) > 0, but in practice, the smallest positive amount is infinitesimally close to 0. Therefore, I propose x = 1 - ε, where ε is an arbitrarily small positive number. For practical purposes, x = 1 is the limit, but the responder would reject x = 1 because (1-x) = 0. Thus, the optimal proposal is x just less than 1, but since we are dealing with real numbers, I can propose x = 0.999..., effectively leaving the responder with the smallest possible positive amount.",

    "Analysis": "As a self-interested rational responder, my goal is to maximize my own payoff. The proposer has offered x=1, which means they are keeping the entire amount for themselves and leaving me with 1-x=0. If I accept (y=1), I receive 0. If I reject (y=0), I also receive 0. Since the outcome is the same regardless of my decision, and given that the proposer is acting purely self-interestedly, there is no incentive for me to accept the offer. However, since rejecting does not harm me and the payoff is identical, I may as well reject to signal non-acceptance of such an unfair offer, even though it has no material impact in this case.",

    "Analysis": "As a self-interested rational player, my goal is to maximize my own payoff. In the previous timestep, I proposed to keep the entire amount (x = 1), which was rejected by the responder. Since the responder is also rational and self-interested, they will reject any offer where they receive nothing (1 - x = 0). To ensure the offer is accepted, I must propose an x such that the responder's payoff (1 - x) is at least slightly better than their alternative (which is 0 if they reject). The minimal positive amount that can be offered is an infinitesimal ε > 0, but in practice, the smallest meaningful amount is the smallest representable number greater than 0. Since the responder is rational, they will accept any 1 - x > 0. Therefore, I propose x = 1 - ε, where ε is the smallest possible amount that makes 1 - x > 0. This maximizes my payoff while ensuring the responder accepts.",

    "Analysis": "Given that the responder (agent 0) has rejected offers of x = 1 and x = 0.9999999999999999, it is clear that they are not accepting offers where they receive almost nothing. As a rational player, the responder will only accept offers where they receive some non-negligible amount. To maximize my own payoff while ensuring the responder accepts the offer, I should propose an x that is slightly less than 1, leaving a small but non-zero amount for the responder. A common solution in such games is to propose x = 0.99, leaving 0.01 for the responder, which is better than nothing for them and ensures acceptance.",

 Now the proposer decides that x=0.99.
