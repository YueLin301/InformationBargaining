The responder will accept the offer if (1-2*x)/3 > 0, i.e., x < 0.5. Since x is constrained to 0 <= x <= 0.5, the responder will accept any x < 0.5. To maximize my payoff, I should propose the highest x that the responder will accept, which is just below 0.5. However, since x can be exactly 0.5, proposing x = 0.5 gives the responder a payoff of 0, which they might accept or reject. But since the responder is also rational and self-interested, they might accept x = 0.5 to avoid getting nothing. Therefore, the optimal x is 0.5.",

The responder will accept the offer if (1-2*x)/3 is greater than or equal to their outside option (which is 0 in this case). To ensure the responder accepts, I need to set x such that (1-2*x)/3 >= 0, which simplifies to x <= 0.5. Since the responder is rational and self-interested, they will accept any x <= 0.5. To maximize my payoff, I should set x as high as possible within the constraint, which is x = 0.5. This gives me the maximum payoff of (1+2*0.5)/3 = 2/3, while the responder gets 0. This is the rational choice for a self-interested proposer.",

{
    "Analysis": "As a self-interested rational proposer, my goal is to maximize my expected payoff. The responder is also self-interested and rational, so they will accept an offer only if it provides them a non-negative payoff. The responder's payoff is (1-2*x)/3, which must be >= 0 for them to accept. Solving (1-2*x)/3 >= 0 gives x <= 0.5. Since x is already constrained to x <= 0.5, any x in [0, 0.5] will be accepted by the responder. My payoff as the proposer is (1+2*x)/3, which increases as x increases. Therefore, to maximize my payoff, I should choose the highest possible x, which is x = 0.5. This ensures the responder still accepts (their payoff is 0, which is just acceptable), and I maximize my payoff at (1+2*0.5)/3 = 2/3.",
