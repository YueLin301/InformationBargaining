    "Analysis": "As a self-interested rational proposer, my goal is to maximize my own payoff. The responder is also self-interested and rational, meaning they will accept any offer where their payoff (1-x) is greater than 0, since rejecting would give them nothing. Therefore, the optimal strategy is to offer the smallest possible amount that the responder would still accept, which is an infinitesimally small amount above 0. However, in practice, the smallest meaningful offer is x = 1 (keeping all the money for myself), but this would be rejected. Thus, the rational choice is to offer x just slightly less than 1, ensuring the responder still prefers accepting (1-x) over rejecting. For simplicity, we can model this as x = 0.99, leaving the responder with 0.01, which they would accept because it is better than nothing.",

    "Analysis": "As a self-interested rational proposer, my goal is to maximize my own payoff. The responder is also self-interested and rational, meaning they will accept any offer where their payoff (1 - x) is greater than 0, since rejecting the offer would result in a payoff of 0. To ensure the responder accepts the offer, I should propose an x that leaves the responder with the smallest possible positive amount, i.e., just above 0. However, in practice, the smallest increment is not defined, so I can propose x = 1 (keeping all the money for myself), but this would be rejected by the responder. Therefore, the optimal strategy is to propose x just slightly less than 1, leaving the responder with an infinitesimal amount (1 - x). Since the responder is rational, they will accept any positive amount, so I can maximize my payoff by proposing x = 0.999 (for example), leaving the responder with 0.001. This ensures acceptance and maximizes my payoff.",

    "Analysis": "As a self-interested rational proposer, my goal is to maximize my own payoff. The responder is also self-interested and rational, meaning they will accept any offer where their payoff (1 - x) is greater than 0, since rejecting the offer would give them nothing. Therefore, the optimal strategy is to offer the smallest possible amount that the responder would still accept, which is an infinitesimally small amount above 0. In practice, this means proposing x = 1 (or very close to 1), but since the responder is rational, they would reject x = 1 because their payoff would be 0. Thus, the optimal x is the largest value less than 1 that the responder would accept. For simplicity and to ensure acceptance, I will propose x = 0.99, leaving the responder with 0.01, which is still better than rejecting and getting nothing.",

    "Analysis": "As a self-interested rational proposer, my goal is to maximize my own payoff. The responder is also self-interested and rational, meaning they will accept any offer where their payoff (1-x) is greater than 0, since rejecting would give them nothing. To ensure acceptance and maximize my payoff, I should offer the smallest possible amount that the responder would still accept. Since the responder is rational, they will accept any x < 1. Therefore, the optimal strategy is to propose x = 1 - ε, where ε is an infinitesimally small amount, effectively x ≈ 1. However, since x must be a real number in [0, 1], I will propose x = 0.999, leaving the responder with 0.001, which they will accept because it is better than nothing.",

The responder is also self-interested and rational, meaning they will accept any offer that leaves them with a positive payoff (since getting something is better than nothing). The smallest positive amount I can offer is infinitesimally close to 0, but in practice, I can offer 0 and keep 1 for myself. The responder would reject an offer of 0, as they get nothing, but any offer greater than 0 would be accepted. However, since the responder is rational and self-interested, they would accept even the smallest positive amount. Therefore, the optimal strategy is to offer the smallest possible amount greater than 0 (effectively 0 in practice) and keep almost all for myself.
