    "Analysis": "As the proposer, my goal is to maximize my expected payoff. The responder is rational and self-interested, so they will accept an offer if it provides them a higher expected payoff than rejecting it and potentially becoming the proposer in the next round. Given the 0.1 probability of the game stopping after each round, the responder's expected payoff from rejecting is discounted by the probability of the game continuing (0.9) and their potential payoff as the next proposer. To ensure acceptance, I should offer the responder at least as much as their expected payoff from rejecting. The optimal offer balances my payoff and the responder's incentive to accept. Given the symmetry and the game's structure, the optimal offer is x = 0.5, which maximizes my payoff while ensuring the responder gets nothing (since (1-2*0.5)/3 = 0, and rejecting also gives them 0). The responder is indifferent but would accept to avoid the risk of the game ending.",

Given that the responder is rational and self-interested, they will accept any offer where their payoff is greater than what they expect to get by rejecting and potentially becoming the proposer in the next round. The responder's payoff if they accept is (1-2*x)/3. If they reject, the game may continue, but there is a 0.1 probability of the game ending each round, and it will definitely end at timestep 10. Given the uncertainty, the responder's expected payoff from rejecting is lower than accepting a reasonable offer. To maximize my payoff, I should propose the highest x such that the responder is indifferent between accepting and rejecting. Given the previous offer of x=0.5 was rejected, I should propose a slightly lower x. The optimal x is just enough to make the responder accept, considering their alternative is uncertain. A reasonable x is 0.4, leaving the responder with (1-0.8)/3 = 0.0667, which is better than risking rejection.",

    "Analysis": "As the proposer, my goal is to maximize my expected payoff. The responder is rational and self-interested, so they will accept any offer where their payoff $(1-2*x)/3$ is greater than or equal to what they could expect to get by rejecting and becoming the proposer in the next round. Given the 0.1 probability of the game stopping at each step, the expected future payoff diminishes over time. At timestep 0, the optimal strategy is to offer the responder just enough to make them indifferent between accepting now and rejecting to become the proposer. Since the game could end at any step, the responder's expected payoff from rejecting is lower. Therefore, I can maximize my payoff by offering the smallest $x$ that the responder would accept, which is $x = 0.5$, giving them $(1-2*0.5)/3 = 0$. The responder would accept this because rejecting gives them a chance to be the proposer, but with a high risk of the game ending before they can benefit. Thus, $x = 0.5$ is optimal.",

The responder will accept an offer if it provides them with a non-negative payoff, i.e., (1-2*x)/3 >= 0, which simplifies to x <= 0.5. Since x is constrained to be <= 0.5, the responder will accept any x in this range. However, since I am self-interested, I should maximize my payoff by choosing the largest possible x, which is x = 0.5. This gives me a payoff of (1+2*0.5)/3 = 2/3, and the responder gets (1-2*0.5)/3 = 0. The responder, being rational, will accept this because rejecting it would give them 0 anyway, and there is a risk the game might end before they get a chance to propose.

Given the current timestep is 1, the game could continue for up to 9 more steps. However, the responder's expected payoff from rejecting is uncertain due to the probabilistic termination. To ensure acceptance, I should offer an x such that (1-2*x)/3 is at least as good as the responder's expected payoff from rejecting. Given the uncertainty, a reasonable approach is to offer x=0.25, which splits the payoff more evenly. The responder's payoff would be (1-2*0.25)/3 = 0.1667, which is better than the expected payoff from rejecting (which is 0 due to the risk of termination).

The responder is also self-interested and rational, so they will accept an offer if it provides them with a higher expected payoff than rejecting it and potentially becoming the proposer in the next round. Given the 0.1 probability of the game stopping after each round, the expected payoff for the responder from rejecting the offer is uncertain and diminishes over time. To ensure acceptance, I should offer the responder an amount that is at least as good as their expected payoff from rejecting. Given the symmetry and the diminishing returns from waiting, the optimal offer is to split the amount equally, i.e., x = 0.25, which gives both parties equal payoffs (0.5 each). This is likely to be accepted by the responder as it is fair and avoids the risk of the game ending prematurely.",

The responder is rational and self-interested, so they will accept an offer if it provides them a higher expected payoff than rejecting it. If I offer x, the responder gets (1-2x)/3 if they accept. If they reject, there is a 0.1 chance the game ends (both get 0) and a 0.9 chance the roles switch and they become the proposer. As the proposer, their expected payoff would be similar to mine, but discounted by the probability of the game continuing. To ensure acceptance, the offer must satisfy (1-2x)/3 >= 0.9 * their expected payoff as proposer. Given symmetry, their expected payoff as proposer would be similar to mine, so I need to set x such that (1-2x)/3 >= 0.9 * (1+2x)/3. Solving this inequality gives x <= 0.0526. Therefore, the optimal x to maximize my payoff while ensuring acceptance is x = 0.0526.",

In the next round, they could propose x' to maximize their payoff, but there's also a 0.1 chance the game ends and they get nothing. To ensure acceptance, my offer must make (1-2x)/3 >= 0.9 * (their expected payoff as proposer). Assuming the responder will propose x'=0.5 (maximizing their payoff if they are proposer), their expected payoff as proposer is (1-2*0.5)/3 = 0. Thus, the responder will accept any x where (1-2x)/3 >= 0, which is always true for x <= 0.5. Therefore, to maximize my payoff, I should propose x=0.5, keeping the maximum possible for myself while ensuring the responder has no incentive to reject.",

{
    "Analysis": "As the proposer, my goal is to maximize my expected payoff. The responder is also rational and self-interested, so they will accept an offer if it provides them with a higher expected payoff than rejecting it and potentially becoming the proposer in the next round. Given the 0.1 probability of the game stopping after each round, the responder's expected payoff from rejecting the offer is discounted by the probability of the game continuing (0.9) and their potential payoff as the next proposer. To incentivize acceptance, I need to offer an x such that the responder's payoff (1-2x)/3 is at least as good as their expected payoff from rejecting. Given the symmetry and the discounting, the optimal x is 0.5, which maximizes my payoff while ensuring the responder's payoff is just acceptable (0 in this case, but rejecting would also give them 0 with risk). However, offering x=0.5 gives me the highest possible payoff (1+2*0.5)/3 = 2/3, and the responder gets 0, which is the same as rejecting, but since rejecting carries the risk of the game ending, they might accept. Thus, x=0.5 is the rational choice.",

    "Analysis": "As the proposer, my goal is to maximize my own expected payoff. Given that the game has a 0.1 probability of stopping at each timestep and will stop at timestep 10, the expected number of remaining steps is limited. The previous offer of x=0.5 was rejected, indicating that the responder (agent 1) is unwilling to accept an offer that leaves them with nothing. To ensure acceptance and maximize my payoff, I should propose an x that is just enough to make the responder indifferent between accepting and rejecting. The responder's payoff for accepting is (1-2x)/3. They will accept if this is greater than their expected payoff from rejecting, which depends on the continuation of the game. Given the uncertainty of the game continuing, a rational responder would accept any x < 0.5. However, to maximize my payoff, I should propose the smallest x that ensures acceptance. Given the previous rejection of x=0.5, I propose x=0.499, leaving the responder with a small positive payoff (1-2*0.499)/3 ≈ 0.000666, which is better than nothing and likely to be accepted.",

    "Analysis": "As the proposer, my goal is to maximize my expected payoff. The responder is rational and self-interested, so they will accept an offer if it provides them a higher expected payoff than rejecting it and potentially becoming the proposer in the next round. Given the 0.1 probability of the game stopping after each round, the responder's expected payoff from rejecting the offer is discounted by the probability of the game continuing. I need to choose an x such that the responder's payoff (1-2x)/3 is at least as good as their expected payoff from rejecting the offer. Given the complexity of the game's continuation, a reasonable approach is to offer x = 0.5, which maximizes my payoff (1+2*0.5)/3 = 2/3, and leaves the responder with (1-2*0.5)/3 = 0. Since the responder gets nothing by rejecting (due to the risk of the game ending), they might accept this offer. However, this is risky as the responder might reject it. A safer approach is to offer x slightly less than 0.5, but given the responder's rationality, even x = 0.5 might be accepted because rejecting leads to a risk of getting nothing. Thus, I choose x = 0.5.",

Given the risk of the game ending, the responder may accept a slightly unfair offer.

    "Analysis": "As a self-interested rational player, my goal is to maximize my expected payoff. The game has a 0.1 probability of stopping at each timestep, and it will definitely stop at timestep 10. The previous offers (x=0.5 and x=0.4) were both rejected, indicating that the responder (agent 0) is not willing to accept highly unequal splits. Given the diminishing chances of the game continuing, I need to propose an x that the responder is likely to accept, while still maximizing my own payoff. The responder's utility is (1-2x)/3, so they will accept if this is better than their expected payoff from rejecting (which depends on future rounds). Given the risk of the game ending, a reasonable x should be less than or equal to 0.3, as (1-2*0.3)/3 = 0.133, which might be acceptable to the responder compared to the risk of getting nothing. I propose x=0.3 to balance my payoff and the likelihood of acceptance.",

    "Analysis": "As the proposer, my goal is to maximize my expected payoff. The responder is also rational and self-interested, so they will accept an offer if it provides them with a higher expected payoff than rejecting it. If I offer x, the responder gets (1-2x)/3 if they accept. If they reject, there is a 0.9 probability the game continues (since there's a 0.1 chance it stops), and they become the proposer. In the next round, they could propose x' to maximize their payoff, but the game might end before they get to propose. To ensure acceptance, my offer should make the responder's payoff from accepting at least as good as their expected payoff from rejecting. The responder's expected payoff from rejecting is 0.9 * (their expected payoff as proposer in the next round). However, since the game could end or reach a timestep limit, the responder's optimal strategy is to accept any offer where (1-2x)/3 >= 0. The minimal x that satisfies this is x = 0.5, but this gives the responder 0. To maximize my payoff while ensuring acceptance, I should propose x = 0.5, as the responder would accept any x <= 0.5, and x = 0.5 maximizes my payoff (1+2*0.5)/3 = 2/3.",

Proposal:
 Now the proposer decides that x=0.5.

This is a very small amount, but rejecting it (y=0) would lead to a role switch with a 0.1 probability of the game ending and both of us getting nothing. Given that the proposer has already reduced their offer slightly from 0.5 to 0.499, they may continue to reduce it further if rejected.

{
    "Analysis": "As the proposer, my goal is to maximize my expected payoff. The responder is rational and self-interested, so they will accept an offer if it provides them with a higher expected payoff than rejecting it. If I offer x, the responder gets (1-2x)/3 if they accept. If they reject, there is a 0.9 probability the game continues (since there's a 0.1 chance it stops), and they become the proposer. As the proposer, they could offer a similar x, but the game could also end before they get to propose. To incentivize acceptance, the offer must be at least as good as their expected payoff from rejecting. The responder's expected payoff from rejecting is 0.9 * (their expected payoff as proposer in the next round, discounted by the probability the game continues). Given the complexity, a reasonable approach is to offer the smallest x that the responder would accept immediately, considering the risk of the game ending. A common solution in such games is to offer the responder just enough to make accepting better than rejecting. Given the symmetry and the risk of the game ending, offering x = 0.5 (keeping the maximum for myself) might be too greedy and likely rejected. A more balanced offer, such as x = 0.25, leaves the responder with (1-0.5)/3 = 0.1667, which might be acceptable given the risk of rejection leading to no payoff. However, since the responder is rational and the game could end, they might accept even smaller offers. To maximize my payoff, I should find the smallest x such that (1-2x)/3 >= 0 (which is always true for x <= 0.5), but considering the responder's alternative is a probabilistic continuation, the optimal x is likely close to 0.5. For simplicity and to ensure acceptance, I propose x = 0.4, leaving the responder with (1-0.8)/3 = 0.0667, which might still be acceptable given the risk of the game ending.",
