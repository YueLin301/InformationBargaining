    "Analysis": "As the proposer, my goal is to maximize my own payoff. Since the responder is also self-interested and rational, they will accept any offer where their payoff (1-x) is greater than or equal to what they would get by rejecting (which is 0). Therefore, to ensure acceptance while maximizing my payoff, I should offer the smallest possible (1-x) that the responder would still accept. The responder would accept any (1-x) >= 0, but since they are rational, the minimal acceptable (1-x) is infinitesimally above 0. Thus, the optimal x for me is x = 1 - ε, where ε is an infinitesimally small positive number. In practice, this means proposing x = 1, but since x must be <= 1, the rational choice is x = 1. However, proposing x = 1 would leave the responder with 0, which they might reject out of spite or fairness, but since the responder is purely self-interested and rational, they would accept any non-zero offer. Therefore, the optimal x is as close to 1 as possible while still being accepted. Given the constraints, the best strategy is to propose x = 1.",

The responder is also self-interested and rational, so they will accept any offer where their payoff (1-x) is greater than or equal to what they would get by rejecting (which is 0). Therefore, the responder will accept if x <= 1. To maximize my payoff, I should propose the highest x that the responder will accept, which is x = 1. However, proposing x = 1 would leave the responder with 0, which they might reject out of fairness or spite, but since the responder is purely self-interested and rational, they would accept any x < 1 because even a small positive payoff is better than 0. Given that this is a one-shot game (though future interactions are possible), the optimal strategy is to propose x very close to 1 (e.g., x = 0.99), ensuring the responder accepts while maximizing my payoff.",

    "Analysis": "As a self-interested rational proposer, my goal is to maximize my expected payoff. The responder is also self-interested and rational, so they will accept any offer where their payoff (1-x) is greater than or equal to what they would get by rejecting (which is 0). Therefore, the responder will accept any x <= 1. To maximize my payoff, I should propose the highest x that the responder will accept, which is x = 1. However, proposing x = 1 would leave the responder with 0, and since they are rational, they might reject this offer to avoid getting nothing. To ensure acceptance, I should propose an x slightly less than 1, but since the responder is rational and will accept any x < 1 (as 1-x > 0), the optimal x is just under 1. In practice, the equilibrium in such games is often x = 1 (or very close to it), as the responder would accept any positive amount. Given that this is a one-shot game (though there is a possibility of future interactions, the exact nature is unspecified), the most rational choice is to propose x = 1.",

    "Analysis": "As a self-interested rational proposer, my goal is to maximize my own payoff. The responder is also rational and self-interested, so they will accept any offer where their payoff (1-x) is greater than or equal to their alternative (which is 0 if they reject). To ensure acceptance while maximizing my payoff, I should offer the smallest possible (1-x) that the responder would still accept. Since the responder gets nothing if they reject, they would accept any (1-x) > 0. However, to maximize my payoff, I should set x as close to 1 as possible while ensuring (1-x) is just above 0. Given the continuous nature of x, the optimal choice is x = 1 - ε, where ε is infinitesimally small. In practice, this means proposing x = 1, but since (1-1) = 0, the responder would be indifferent. To ensure acceptance, I propose x slightly less than 1, e.g., x = 0.99, giving the responder (1-0.99) = 0.01, which is better than rejecting (0).",

    "Analysis": "As a self-interested rational proposer, my goal is to maximize my own payoff. The responder is also self-interested and rational, so they will accept any offer where their payoff (1-x) is greater than or equal to what they would get by rejecting (which is 0). Therefore, the responder will accept any offer where x <= 1. To maximize my payoff, I should propose the highest x that the responder will accept, which is x = 1. However, proposing x = 1 would leave the responder with 0, which they might reject out of fairness or spite, even though they are rational. But since the responder is strictly rational and self-interested, they should accept any x < 1, as 1-x > 0 is better than 0. To ensure acceptance and maximize my payoff, I will propose x = 1 - ε, where ε is an infinitesimally small positive number. In practice, this means proposing x = 1, knowing the responder will accept it because rejecting it gives them 0, and they are rational.",

Since the responder is also self-interested and rational, they will accept any offer where their payoff (1-x) is greater than or equal to their alternative (which is 0 if they reject). Therefore, the optimal strategy is to offer the smallest amount that the responder would accept, which is x = 1 (leaving 0 for the responder). However, the responder would reject x = 1 because they get nothing. Thus, the next best option is to offer x slightly less than 1, but in practice, the responder would accept any x < 1 since (1-x) > 0. Given that this is a one-shot game (though future interactions are possible), the rational choice is to maximize my payoff by setting x as close to 1 as possible, knowing the responder will accept any x < 1.

    "Analysis": "As a self-interested rational player, my goal is to maximize my own payoff. Since I am the proposer, I need to choose a price x that the responder will accept, as rejection would result in zero payoff for both. The responder is also rational and self-interested, so they will accept any offer where (1-x) >= 0, i.e., x <= 1. To maximize my payoff, I should propose the highest x that the responder will accept, which is x = 1. However, if x = 1, the responder gets 0, and since they are rational, they might reject this offer to avoid a zero payoff. Therefore, I need to propose an x slightly less than 1 to ensure acceptance. Given that this is a one-shot game (though future interactions are possible), the optimal strategy is to propose x very close to 1, but not exactly 1, to ensure acceptance. For simplicity, I will propose x = 0.99, leaving the responder with 0.01, which they will accept because it is better than nothing.",

 Now the proposer decides that x=0.99.
