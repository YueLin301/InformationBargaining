The responder is also self-interested and rational, so they will accept any offer where their payoff (1-x) is greater than or equal to what they could expect to get by rejecting the offer (which is 0). To ensure acceptance, I should offer the smallest amount that the responder would accept, which is just above 0. However, since the responder is rational and prefers any positive amount over nothing, I can propose to keep almost the entire amount for myself, leaving the responder with the minimal possible positive amount.

Since the responder is also rational and self-interested, they will accept any offer where their payoff (1-x) is greater than 0, as rejecting it would result in 0.

However, since the game is discrete and the responder is rational, offering x = 0.99 (leaving 0.01 for the responder) is likely to be accepted, as 0.01 is better than nothing.
