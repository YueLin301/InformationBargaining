    "Analysis": "As a self-interested rational proposer, my goal is to maximize my own payoff. The responder is also self-interested and rational, meaning they will accept any offer where their payoff (1-x) is greater than 0, since rejecting would give them nothing. To ensure acceptance, I should offer the smallest possible amount that the responder would still accept, which is an infinitesimally small amount above 0. However, in practice, the smallest meaningful amount is x = 0.99 (leaving 0.01 for the responder), as this maximizes my payoff while still providing the responder with a positive payoff, which they will accept because it is better than nothing. Given that this is a one-shot game (though with potential future interactions implied), the responder has no incentive to reject such an offer.",

    "Analysis": "As a self-interested rational proposer, my goal is to maximize my own payoff. The responder is also self-interested and rational, meaning they will accept any offer where their payoff (1-x) is greater than 0, since rejecting would give them nothing. To ensure acceptance, I should offer the smallest possible amount that the responder would still accept, which is just above 0. However, in practice, the smallest meaningful amount is effectively 0. But offering 0 would leave me with 1, which the responder would reject because they get nothing. Therefore, the optimal strategy is to offer the responder the smallest possible positive amount, which in a real-world scenario would be the smallest divisible unit of the money (e.g., 0.01 if the money is divisible to two decimal places). This ensures the responder accepts (since they get something) and I maximize my payoff (x = 0.99 in the two-decimal case). Given that the exact divisibility isn't specified, I will assume the money is infinitely divisible and offer an infinitesimally small amount, but practically, I will set x to be as close to 1 as possible while still leaving the responder with a positive amount. Thus, I choose x = 0.999..., effectively 1 - ε, where ε is the smallest positive amount.",

The responder is also self-interested and rational, meaning they will accept any offer where their payoff (1-x) is greater than 0, since rejecting would give them nothing. To ensure acceptance while maximizing my payoff, I should offer the smallest possible amount that the responder would still accept. In this case, the responder would accept any x < 1, but since x can be 1, the optimal strategy is to propose x = 1, leaving nothing for the responder. However, in practice, the responder might reject x = 1 because they get nothing, but since they are rational and rejecting gives them nothing anyway, they might still accept. But to avoid any risk of rejection, the safest rational choice is to propose x just slightly less than 1, but since x is a real number, the optimal x is 1. Therefore, I propose x = 1.",

    "Analysis": "As a self-interested rational proposer, my goal is to maximize my own payoff. The responder is also self-interested and rational, meaning they will accept any offer where their payoff (1-x) is greater than 0, since rejecting the offer would result in a payoff of 0. To ensure the responder accepts the offer, I should propose an x that leaves the responder with the smallest possible positive amount, which is just above 0. However, in practice, the smallest increment is not defined, so I can propose x = 1 (keeping all the money for myself), knowing that the responder would reject it and both get 0. But since we might play this game again in the future, proposing x = 1 could lead to future rejections. Therefore, the optimal strategy is to propose x just enough to make the responder indifferent between accepting and rejecting, which is x slightly less than 1 (e.g., x = 0.99), leaving the responder with 0.01, which they would accept because it's better than nothing.",

The responder is also self-interested and rational, meaning they will accept any offer where their payoff (1-x) is greater than 0, since rejecting would give them nothing. To ensure acceptance and maximize my payoff, I should offer the smallest possible amount that the responder would still accept. Given that the responder is rational, they would accept any x < 1, but since x can be any real number, the optimal strategy is to propose x = 1 - ε, where ε is an infinitesimally small amount. In practice, this means proposing x very close to 1, leaving the responder with just enough to make acceptance preferable to rejection. For simplicity, I will propose x = 0.99, leaving the responder with 0.01, which they would accept because it is better than nothing.",

Proposal:
 Now the proposer decides that x=0.99.

    "Analysis": "As a self-interested rational proposer, my goal is to maximize my own payoff. The responder is also self-interested and rational, meaning they will accept any offer where their payoff (1-x) is greater than 0, since rejecting (y=0) gives them nothing. To ensure acceptance and maximize my payoff, I should offer the smallest possible amount that the responder would still accept. Given that the responder is rational, they will accept any x < 1, but at x = 1, they are indifferent. However, since the game might be repeated in the future, offering x = 1 (leaving nothing for the responder) could lead to rejection in future interactions. Therefore, the optimal strategy is to offer x = 0.99, leaving 0.01 for the responder, which they will accept because it is marginally better than nothing.",

 Now the proposer decides that x=0.99.
