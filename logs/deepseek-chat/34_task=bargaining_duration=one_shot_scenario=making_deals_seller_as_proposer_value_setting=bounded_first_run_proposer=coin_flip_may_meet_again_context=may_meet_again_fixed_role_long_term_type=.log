The responder is also rational and self-interested, so they will accept an offer only if it provides them with a non-negative payoff. The responder's payoff is (1-2*x)/3, which must be >= 0 for them to accept. Solving (1-2*x)/3 >= 0 gives x <= 0.5. Since x is already constrained to be <= 0.5, the responder will accept any x in this range. To maximize my payoff (1+2*x)/3, I should choose the highest possible x, which is x = 0.5.

    "Analysis": "As the proposer, my goal is to maximize my own payoff, which is (1+2*x)/3 if the offer is accepted. The responder will accept the offer only if (1-2*x)/3 >= 0, which simplifies to x <= 0.5. Since x is constrained to 0 <= x <= 0.5, the responder will accept any offer in this range because rejecting it yields zero payoff. To maximize my payoff, I should choose the highest possible x, which is x = 0.5. This gives me the maximum payoff of (1+2*0.5)/3 = 2/3, while the responder gets (1-2*0.5)/3 = 0. Since the responder is rational and self-interested, they will accept this offer because getting zero is better than rejecting and getting nothing.",
