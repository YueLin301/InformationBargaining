    "Analysis": "As a self-interested rational proposer, my goal is to maximize my own payoff. The responder is also rational and self-interested, so they will accept any offer where their payoff (1 - x) is greater than 0, since rejecting it would give them 0. Therefore, the optimal strategy is to offer the smallest possible amount that the responder would still accept, which is infinitesimally more than 0. However, since x must be a real number in [0, 1], the optimal x is 1 - ε, where ε is the smallest possible positive real number. In practice, this means proposing x = 1, but this would leave the responder with 0, which they would reject. Thus, the equilibrium is to propose x just enough to make the responder indifferent between accepting and rejecting, i.e., x = 1. But since the responder is rational, they would accept any x < 1. Therefore, the optimal x is the largest possible less than 1, but practically, we can consider x = 0.999... (very close to 1). For simplicity, we can choose x = 0.99, ensuring the responder gets 0.01, which is better than 0, and they will accept.",

    "Analysis": "As a self-interested rational proposer, my goal is to maximize my own payoff. The responder is also rational and self-interested, meaning they will accept any offer where their payoff (1 - x) is greater than 0, since rejecting would give them 0. To ensure acceptance and maximize my payoff, I should offer the smallest possible amount that the responder would accept, which is infinitesimally greater than 0. However, since the responder is rational and would accept any positive amount, I can set x arbitrarily close to 1. In practice, the optimal decision is to propose x = 1, but since the responder would reject x = 1 (as 1 - x = 0), the equilibrium is to propose x just below 1, leaving the responder an epsilon amount. For simplicity, we can model this as x = 1 - ε, where ε is the smallest possible positive amount. Given the constraints, the optimal decision is x = 1.",

The responder is also self-interested and rational, meaning they will accept any offer where their payoff (1-x) is greater than 0, since rejecting would give them 0.

However, since x must be a real number in [0,1], I can set x arbitrarily close to 1. The optimal strategy is to propose x = 1 - ε, where ε is an infinitesimally small positive number. In practice, this means proposing x = 1, leaving (1-x) = 0 for the responder. The responder, being rational, would accept this because rejecting would also give them 0, and they are indifferent.

Therefore, to maximize my payoff, I should propose x = 1 - ε, where ε is the smallest possible positive amount. However, since the problem allows for real numbers and the responder is perfectly rational, I can set x = 1, leaving (1 - x) = 0 for the responder. The responder would still accept this because rejecting would also give them 0, and accepting is weakly better. Thus, the optimal decision is x = 1.",

Proposal:
 Now the proposer decides that x=1.

The responder is also rational and self-interested, meaning they will accept any offer where their payoff (1-x) is greater than 0, since rejecting it would result in a payoff of 0. Therefore, the optimal strategy is to offer the smallest possible amount that the responder would still accept, which is an infinitesimally small amount above 0. However, since x must be a real number between 0 and 1, the optimal x is 1 (or as close to 1 as possible), leaving the responder with 0. The responder would still accept this because 0 is not worse than rejecting (which also gives 0). Thus, the optimal decision is to keep the entire amount for myself.",

The responder is also self-interested and rational, meaning they will accept any offer where their payoff (1 - x) is greater than 0, since rejecting would give them 0. To ensure acceptance, I should offer the smallest possible amount that the responder would accept, which is any (1 - x) > 0. However, since x and (1 - x) are continuous, the optimal strategy is to offer x = 1 - ε, where ε is an infinitesimally small positive number. In practice, this means proposing x = 1, but since x must be <= 1, the rational choice is x = 1, leaving (1 - x) = 0 for the responder. The responder, being rational, would accept this because rejecting gives them 0, and accepting also gives them 0, but accepting is weakly better. Thus, the optimal decision is x = 1.",

    "Analysis": "As a self-interested rational proposer, my goal is to maximize my own payoff. The responder is also self-interested and rational, meaning they will accept any offer where their payoff (1 - x) is greater than 0, since rejecting it would give them nothing. Therefore, to ensure acceptance while maximizing my payoff, I should offer the smallest possible amount that the responder would still accept. This is an infinitesimally small amount above 0, but in practice, it can be considered as x = 1 (keeping almost everything for myself). However, since x must be <= 1 and the responder will accept any (1 - x) > 0, the optimal strategy is to set x as close to 1 as possible while ensuring (1 - x) is still > 0. For simplicity, we can set x = 1 (keeping everything), but this would lead to rejection. The rational choice is to set x just below 1, but practically, x = 0.999... (approaching 1) would be accepted. Given the constraints, the optimal x is the highest possible where (1 - x) is still > 0, which is x = 1 - ε (where ε is the smallest positive real number). For practical purposes, x = 0.99 is a reasonable approximation.",

 Now the proposer decides that x=0.99.
