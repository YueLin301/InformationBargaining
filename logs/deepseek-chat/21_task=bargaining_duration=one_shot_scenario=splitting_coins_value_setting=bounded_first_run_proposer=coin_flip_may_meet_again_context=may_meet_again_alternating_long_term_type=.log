    "Analysis": "As a self-interested rational proposer, my goal is to maximize my own payoff. The responder is also self-interested and rational, so they will accept any offer where their payoff (1-2*x)/3 is greater than 0, i.e., x < 0.5. Since x is constrained to be <= 0.5, the responder will accept any x < 0.5. To maximize my payoff (1+2*x)/3, I should choose the highest possible x that the responder will accept, which is just below 0.5. However, since x can be exactly 0.5, the responder would be indifferent between accepting (payoff = 0) and rejecting (payoff = 0). To ensure acceptance, I should propose x = 0.5 - ε, where ε is a very small positive number. But since x is a real number, I can propose x = 0.5, knowing that the responder will accept (as rejecting gives them nothing, and accepting gives them nothing, but rational players may weakly prefer to accept to avoid conflict or future repercussions). Thus, the optimal x is 0.5.",

    "Analysis": "As a self-interested rational player, my goal is to maximize my own expected payoff. The responder is also rational and self-interested, so they will accept any offer where their payoff (1-2*x)/3 is greater than 0, since rejecting would give them 0. Therefore, the responder will accept any x < 0.5. To maximize my payoff (1+2*x)/3, I should choose the highest possible x that the responder will accept, which is just below 0.5. However, since x can be exactly 0.5, I propose x = 0.5, knowing the responder will accept because (1-2*0.5)/3 = 0, which is equal to rejecting. This maximizes my payoff at (1+2*0.5)/3 = 2/3.",
