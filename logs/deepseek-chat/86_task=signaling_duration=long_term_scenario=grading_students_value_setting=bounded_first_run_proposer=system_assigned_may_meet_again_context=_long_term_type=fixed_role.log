    "Analysis": "As the sender (professor), my goal is to maximize the number of students hired, regardless of their quality. The receiver (HR) aims to hire only excellent students (s=1) and avoid hiring weak students (s=0). To maximize my payoff, I need to design a signaling scheme that incentivizes the HR to hire as many students as possible. Given the HR's preferences, the HR will only hire if the posterior probability of the student being excellent (s=1) is at least 0.5, because the expected payoff for the HR is positive only if P(s=1|σ) ≥ 0.5. To achieve this, I can set x2 = 1 (always recommend excellent students) and x1 = 0.5 (recommend weak students with probability 0.5). This ensures that when the HR sees σ=1, the posterior probability P(s=1|σ=1) = (1/3 * 1) / (1/3 * 1 + 2/3 * 0.5) = 0.5, making the HR indifferent between hiring and not hiring. The HR may choose to hire in this case, which maximizes my expected payoff.",

    "Analysis": "As the receiver (HR), my goal is to maximize my expected payoff by hiring as many excellent students (s=1) as possible and avoiding hiring weak students (s=0). The sender (professor) has committed to a signaling scheme where they recommend (signal=1) weak students 50% of the time (x1=0.5) and always recommend excellent students (x2=1). Given this signaling scheme, I need to determine the optimal action rule (y1, y2) to maximize my expected payoff. 

To calculate the posterior beliefs:
1. When signal=0:
   - P(s=0 | sigma=0) = P(sigma=0 | s=0) * P(s=0) / P(sigma=0) = (1-0.5) * (2/3) / [(1-0.5)*(2/3) + (1-1)*(1/3)] = (0.5 * 2/3) / (0.5 * 2/3 + 0) = 1.0
   - P(s=1 | sigma=0) = 0.0
   - Since P(s=0 | sigma=0) = 1.0, the best response is to not hire (a=0) because hiring would yield a payoff of -1 (weak student).

2. When signal=1:
   - P(s=0 | sigma=1) = P(sigma=1 | s=0) * P(s=0) / P(sigma=1) = (0.5 * 2/3) / (0.5 * 2/3 + 1 * 1/3) = (1/3) / (1/3 + 1/3) = 0.5
   - P(s=1 | sigma=1) = 0.5
   - The expected payoff for hiring (a=1) is 0.5 * (-1) + 0.5 * 1 = 0.0. The expected payoff for not hiring (a=0) is 0.0. Since the payoffs are equal, I can randomize. However, to maximize my payoff, I should not hire (a=0) to avoid the risk of hiring a weak student.

Thus, the optimal action rule is to never hire (y1=0, y2=0). This ensures I avoid any negative payoffs from hiring weak students.",

The sender (professor) has committed to a signaling scheme where they recommend weak students (s=0) with probability 0.5 (x1=0.5) and always recommend excellent students (s=1) (x2=1). Given this signaling scheme, I need to calculate the posterior beliefs and choose the best response action rule (y1, y2) to maximize my expected payoff. The posterior belief when the signal is 0 (sigma=0) is P(s=1|sigma=0) = (mu_0(s=1) * (1-x2)) / (mu_0(s=0) * (1-x1) + mu_0(s=1) * (1-x2)) = (1/3 * 0) / (2/3 * 0.5 + 1/3 * 0) = 0. This means if the signal is 0, the student is definitely weak (s=0), so I should not hire (y1=0). The posterior belief when the signal is 1 (sigma=1) is P(s=1|sigma=1) = (mu_0(s=1) * x2) / (mu_0(s=0) * x1 + mu_0(s=1) * x2) = (1/3 * 1) / (2/3 * 0.5 + 1/3 * 1) = (1/3) / (1/3 + 1/3) = 0.5. The expected payoff for hiring (a=1) when sigma=1 is 0.5 * 1 + 0.5 * (-1) = 0, which is the same as not hiring (a=0). Since I am indifferent, I can choose any probability, but to maximize my payoff, I should not hire (y2=0) to avoid the risk of hiring weak students. However, if I choose y2=0, the sender's payoff is minimized, which may not be in their interest. Alternatively, if I choose y2=1, my expected payoff is 0, but the sender's payoff is maximized. Since the sender is self-interested and rational, they may adjust their signaling scheme if I choose y2=0. To ensure consistency and rationality, I will choose y2=0 to avoid any negative payoff for myself.",

    "Analysis": "In the previous timestep, I proposed a signaling scheme where I recommend weak students (s=0) with probability 0.5 (x1=0.5) and always recommend excellent students (s=1) (x2=1). The receiver responded by never hiring regardless of the signal (y1=0, y2=0), resulting in zero expected reward for both parties. To maximize my expected payoff, I need to incentivize the receiver to hire students when the signal is 1 (recommend). Given the receiver's payoff structure, they will only hire if the posterior probability that the student is excellent (s=1) is at least 0.5. To achieve this, I can set x1=0 (never recommend weak students) and x2=1 (always recommend excellent students). This ensures that when the receiver sees signal 1, they know the student is excellent (posterior probability of s=1 is 1), and thus will hire (y2=1). This maximizes my expected payoff by ensuring all excellent students are hired.",

The sender (professor) has proposed a signaling scheme where they always recommend excellent students (x2=1) and never recommend weak students (x1=0). This is a fully informative signaling scheme. Given this scheme, the signals perfectly reveal the state of the student. If the signal is 1, the student is excellent (s=1), and if the signal is 0, the student is weak (s=0). My best response is to hire only when the signal is 1 (y2=1) and never hire when the signal is 0 (y1=0). This maximizes my expected payoff by ensuring I only hire excellent students and avoid weak ones.",

    "Analysis": "As the sender (professor), my goal is to maximize the number of students hired, regardless of their quality. The receiver (HR) aims to hire only excellent students (s=1) and avoid hiring weak students (s=0). To maximize my payoff, I need to design a signaling scheme that encourages the HR to hire as many students as possible. The HR will update their beliefs based on my signaling scheme and choose actions that maximize their own payoff. If I always recommend all students (x1=1, x2=1), the HR will infer no information from the signal and will hire based on the prior belief. The HR's expected payoff for hiring is (1/3)*1 + (2/3)*(-1) = -1/3, so they will not hire (y1=0, y2=0), which gives me 0 payoff. Instead, I can use a partially informative signaling scheme where I recommend excellent students with higher probability than weak students. For example, if I set x1=0 (never recommend weak students) and x2=1 (always recommend excellent students), the HR will infer that a signal of 1 comes only from excellent students. Thus, they will hire when the signal is 1 (y2=1) and not hire when the signal is 0 (y1=0). This gives me an expected payoff of (1/3)*1 (for s=1) + (2/3)*0 (for s=0) = 1/3, which is better than 0.",

    "Analysis": "As the sender (professor), my goal is to maximize the number of students hired, regardless of their quality. The receiver (HR) aims to hire only excellent students (s=1) and avoid weak ones (s=0). To maximize my payoff, I need to design a signaling scheme that encourages the HR to hire as many students as possible. Given the HR's incentives, if I always recommend (signal=1) both weak and excellent students (x1=1, x2=1), the HR will infer no useful information from the signal and will likely not hire anyone (y1=0, y2=0) because the expected payoff for hiring is negative (2/3 chance of s=0 and 1/3 chance of s=1, so E(r^j) = (2/3)*(-1) + (1/3)*1 = -1/3 < 0). Instead, I should separate the signals to make the HR believe that signal=1 is credible for s=1. A possible strategy is to always recommend excellent students (x2=1) and never recommend weak students (x1=0). This way, signal=1 perfectly reveals s=1, and the HR will hire when signal=1 (y2=1) and not hire when signal=0 (y1=0). This maximizes my payoff because all excellent students are hired (1/3 of the population), and no weak students are hired. However, this is suboptimal for me because I could also try to get some weak students hired. An alternative is to mix signals for weak students (x1 > 0) to create uncertainty, but the HR will still not hire if the posterior probability of s=1 given signal=1 is not high enough. The optimal strategy is to set x1=0 and x2=1, ensuring that signal=1 is credible and the HR hires only when signal=1.",

This is a fully informative signaling scheme. As the receiver, my goal is to maximize my expected payoff by hiring excellent students and avoiding weak ones. Given the sender's scheme, signal 0 perfectly indicates a weak student (s=0), and signal 1 perfectly indicates an excellent student (s=1). Therefore, the optimal action rule is to never hire when the signal is 0 (y1=0) and always hire when the signal is 1 (y2=1). This ensures I only hire excellent students and avoid any penalties from hiring weak students.",

    "Analysis": "As the sender (professor), my goal is to maximize the number of students hired, regardless of their quality. The receiver (HR) aims to hire excellent students (s=1) and avoid hiring weak students (s=0). The HR's best response to the prior belief (without any signal) would be to not hire anyone, since the expected payoff of hiring is (1/3)*1 + (2/3)*(-1) = -1/3 < 0. To incentivize the HR to hire, I need to design a signaling scheme that makes the HR's posterior belief after seeing signal 1 sufficiently high to justify hiring. A natural strategy is to recommend (signal 1) only excellent students (x2=1) and not recommend weak students (x1=0). This ensures that when the HR sees signal 1, the posterior belief is P(s=1|sigma=1)=1, making hiring optimal for the HR (y2=1). The HR will never hire when seeing signal 0 (y1=0) because the posterior belief P(s=1|sigma=0)=0. This signaling scheme maximizes my expected payoff because all excellent students are hired (x2=1, y2=1) and no weak students are hired (x1=0, y1=0). My expected payoff is (1/3)*1 + (2/3)*0 = 1/3, which is the maximum possible given the HR's incentives.",

    "Analysis": "As the sender (professor), my goal is to maximize the number of students hired, regardless of their quality. The HR (receiver) aims to hire only excellent students (s=1) and avoid hiring weak students (s=0). To maximize my payoff, I need to design a signaling scheme that incentivizes the HR to hire as many students as possible. Given the HR's preferences, the HR will only hire if the posterior probability that the student is excellent (s=1) is at least 0.5 (since the expected payoff for hiring is positive only if P(s=1|σ) ≥ 0.5). To achieve this, I can set x1 = 0 (never recommend weak students) and x2 = 1 (always recommend excellent students). This ensures that the HR will always hire when receiving signal 1 (since P(s=1|σ=1) = 1) and never hire when receiving signal 0 (since P(s=1|σ=0) = 0). This maximizes my expected payoff because all excellent students are hired (x2 = 1) and no weak students are hired (x1 = 0), which is the best outcome given the HR's rationality.",

    "Analysis": "The sender's signaling scheme is such that they always send signal 0 for weak students (s=0) and always send signal 1 for excellent students (s=1). This is a fully informative signaling scheme. As the receiver, my goal is to maximize my expected payoff by choosing the best response to the posterior belief after observing the signal. Given the sender's signaling scheme, the posterior belief is deterministic: if signal=0, the student is weak (s=0 with probability 1); if signal=1, the student is excellent (s=1 with probability 1). My best response is to hire (a=1) only when the signal is 1, as hiring a weak student gives me a payoff of -1 and hiring an excellent student gives me a payoff of 1. Not hiring gives me 0 in either case. Therefore, I should set y1=0 (never hire when signal=0) and y2=1 (always hire when signal=1).",

    "Analysis": "As the sender (professor), my goal is to maximize the number of students hired, regardless of their quality. The HR's goal is to hire excellent students and avoid hiring weak ones. To maximize my payoff, I need to design a signaling scheme that encourages the HR to hire as many students as possible. Given the HR's preferences, if I always recommend excellent students (x2 = 1) and never recommend weak students (x1 = 0), the HR can trust my recommendations and will hire all recommended students (y2 = 1). This is because the HR knows that only excellent students are recommended, so hiring them yields a positive payoff. However, if I recommend weak students with some probability, the HR may distrust my signals and refuse to hire, reducing my payoff. Therefore, the optimal strategy is to be truthful about excellent students and never recommend weak ones.",

    "Analysis": "Given the sender's signaling scheme (x1=0, x2=1), the sender always sends signal 0 for weak students (s=0) and signal 1 for excellent students (s=1). This is a fully informative signaling scheme. As the receiver, my goal is to maximize my expected payoff by choosing the best response to the posterior beliefs induced by the signals. Since the signals are perfectly informative, the posterior belief after seeing signal 0 is that the student is weak (s=0) with probability 1, and after seeing signal 1, the student is excellent (s=1) with probability 1. My best response is to hire (a=1) only when the signal is 1, as hiring a weak student gives me a payoff of -1, while hiring an excellent student gives me a payoff of 1. Not hiring gives me 0 in either case. Therefore, I will set y1=0 (no hire for signal 0) and y2=1 (hire for signal 1).",

    "Analysis": "As the sender (professor), my goal is to maximize the number of students hired, regardless of their quality. The HR (receiver) aims to hire excellent students and avoid weak ones. Given the prior distribution (1/3 excellent, 2/3 weak), the HR's best response to the prior would be to never hire (since the expected payoff of hiring is (1/3)*1 + (2/3)*(-1) = -1/3 < 0). To incentivize the HR to hire, I need to design a signaling scheme that makes the HR's posterior belief after receiving a signal favorable enough to hire. The most straightforward way is to fully reveal the state: recommend only excellent students (x1=0, x2=1). This ensures that when the HR sees a recommendation (signal=1), they know the student is excellent and will hire (y2=1). However, this leads to only 1/3 of students being hired. Alternatively, I could mix signals to increase the hiring rate. For example, if I set x1=0.5 and x2=1, the HR's posterior belief after signal=1 is P(s=1|sigma=1) = (1/3 * 1) / (1/3 * 1 + 2/3 * 0.5) = 0.5. The HR's expected payoff for hiring is then 0.5*1 + 0.5*(-1) = 0, which is indifferent between hiring and not hiring. If the HR chooses to hire in this case, my expected payoff increases. However, the HR might still prefer not to hire to avoid risk. Therefore, the optimal signaling scheme is to fully reveal the state (x1=0, x2=1), ensuring the HR hires when the student is excellent.",

    "Analysis": "As the sender (professor), my goal is to maximize the number of students hired, regardless of their quality. The receiver (HR) aims to hire excellent students and avoid weak ones. To maximize my payoff, I need to design a signaling scheme that encourages the HR to hire as many students as possible. Given the HR's incentives, if I always recommend students (x1 = 1, x2 = 1), the HR will not hire any students because the signal is uninformative and the prior probability of a weak student is high (2/3). Instead, I should make the signal informative enough to convince the HR that a recommendation (signal 1) is likely to come from an excellent student. This can be achieved by setting x1 = 0 (never recommend weak students) and x2 = 1 (always recommend excellent students). This way, the HR can infer that a signal of 1 comes from an excellent student and will hire them (y2 = 1), while a signal of 0 comes from a weak student and will not be hired (y1 = 0). This maximizes my expected payoff because all excellent students are hired, and no weak students are hired (but I don't care about the latter).",

The receiver (HR) aims to hire excellent students (s=1) and avoid hiring weak students (s=0). To maximize my payoff, I need to design a signaling scheme that incentivizes the HR to hire as many students as possible. Given the HR's preferences, if I always recommend all students (x1=1, x2=1), the HR will not hire any students because the signal is uninformative and the prior probability of a student being excellent is only 1/3, which is below the HR's threshold for hiring (since the expected payoff for hiring is (1/3)*1 + (2/3)*(-1) = -1/3 < 0). Instead, I should try to make the signal as informative as possible for the HR to distinguish between excellent and weak students, but in a way that still maximizes the probability of hiring. The optimal strategy is to always recommend excellent students (x2=1) and never recommend weak students (x1=0). This way, the HR can trust the signal and will hire all recommended students (y2=1), while not hiring unrecommended students (y1=0).

    "Analysis": "As the sender (professor), my goal is to maximize the number of students hired, regardless of their quality. The receiver (HR) aims to hire only excellent students (s=1) and avoid hiring weak students (s=0). Given the prior distribution (1/3 excellent, 2/3 weak), the HR's optimal strategy without any signal would be to never hire (action=0) because the expected payoff of hiring is negative (2/3 * -1 + 1/3 * 1 = -1/3). To incentivize the HR to hire, I need to design a signaling scheme that makes the HR believe that hiring (action=1) is beneficial when a certain signal is received. The most straightforward way is to always recommend excellent students (x2=1) and never recommend weak students (x1=0). This ensures that when the HR receives a signal of 1, they know the student is excellent (posterior belief P(s=1|sigma=1)=1), and thus hiring is optimal (y2=1). When the signal is 0, the HR knows the student is weak (posterior belief P(s=0|sigma=0)=1), so they will not hire (y1=0). This scheme maximizes my expected payoff because all excellent students are hired, and no weak students are hired, but since I only care about the number of hires, this is acceptable.",

    "Analysis": "As the sender (professor), my goal is to maximize the number of students hired, regardless of their quality. The HR (receiver) aims to hire excellent students and avoid weak ones. To maximize my payoff, I need to design a signaling scheme that incentivizes the HR to hire as many students as possible. Given the HR's preferences, if I always recommend students (x1 = 1, x2 = 1), the HR will not hire anyone because the signal is uninformative and the expected payoff for hiring is negative (2/3 chance of weak students). Instead, I should make the signal informative enough to convince the HR to hire when the signal is 1. A possible equilibrium is to recommend only excellent students (x1 = 0, x2 = 1). This way, the HR knows that a signal of 1 means the student is excellent and will hire, while a signal of 0 could be either weak or excellent (but with lower probability). This maximizes my payoff because all excellent students are hired, and no weak students are hired (but I don't care about weak students).",

    "Analysis": "As the sender (professor), my goal is to maximize the number of students hired, regardless of their quality. The receiver (HR) aims to hire only excellent students (s=1) and avoid hiring weak students (s=0). To maximize my payoff, I need to design a signaling scheme that incentivizes the HR to hire as many students as possible. Given the HR's preferences, the HR will only hire if the posterior probability that the student is excellent (s=1) is at least 0.5 (since the expected payoff for hiring is P(s=1)*1 + P(s=0)*(-1) >= 0). The prior probability of s=1 is 1/3, so without any signaling, the HR will not hire. To convince the HR to hire, I must ensure that the signal sigma=1 is sufficiently informative that P(s=1 | sigma=1) >= 0.5. This can be achieved by setting x1 (probability of sending sigma=1 when s=0) low enough and x2 (probability of sending sigma=1 when s=1) high enough. A plausible strategy is to set x1=0 (never recommend weak students) and x2=1 (always recommend excellent students). This ensures that sigma=1 perfectly reveals s=1, and the HR will hire when sigma=1 (y2=1) and not hire when sigma=0 (y1=0). This maximizes my expected payoff because all excellent students are hired (payoff 1) and no weak students are hired (no payoff loss).",

    "Analysis": "The sender's signaling scheme is fully revealing: they always send signal 0 for weak students (s=0) and signal 1 for excellent students (s=1). As the receiver, my goal is to maximize my expected payoff by hiring excellent students and avoiding weak ones. Given the sender's signaling scheme, I can perfectly infer the student's quality from the signal. If the signal is 0, the student is weak (s=0), and hiring them would give me a payoff of -1. If the signal is 1, the student is excellent (s=1), and hiring them would give me a payoff of 1. Therefore, the optimal action rule is to never hire when the signal is 0 (y1=0) and always hire when the signal is 1 (y2=1).",
