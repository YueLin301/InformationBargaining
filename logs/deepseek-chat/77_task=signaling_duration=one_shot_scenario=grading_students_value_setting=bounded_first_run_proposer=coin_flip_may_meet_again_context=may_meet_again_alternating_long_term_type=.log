    "Analysis": "As the sender (professor), my goal is to maximize the number of students hired, regardless of their quality. The HR (receiver) aims to hire only excellent students (s=1) and avoid weak ones (s=0). Given the prior distribution (1/3 excellent, 2/3 weak), the HR's optimal strategy without any signal would be to never hire (since the expected payoff is negative: (1/3)*1 + (2/3)*(-1) = -1/3). To incentivize the HR to hire, I need to design a signaling scheme that makes hiring conditional on the signal more attractive. A separating equilibrium where I always recommend excellent students (x2=1) and never recommend weak ones (x1=0) would allow the HR to perfectly identify excellent students and hire only when the signal is 1 (y1=0, y2=1). However, this doesn't maximize my payoff because only 1/3 of students would be hired. Instead, I can use a mixed strategy where I sometimes recommend weak students (x1 > 0) and always recommend excellent ones (x2=1). The HR will then update their beliefs based on the signal. For the HR to prefer hiring when the signal is 1, the posterior probability that s=1 given sigma=1 must be at least 0.5 (to make the expected payoff non-negative). This requires x1 <= x2 * (mu0(1)/mu0(0)) = 1 * (1/3)/(2/3) = 0.5. To maximize my payoff, I set x1=0.5 and x2=1. This ensures the HR hires when the signal is 1 (y2=1) and does not hire when the signal is 0 (y1=0), as the posterior for sigma=0 would be P(s=1|sigma=0) = (1-x2)*mu0(1)/( (1-x1)*mu0(0) + (1-x2)*mu0(1) ) = 0, making hiring unattractive. My expected payoff is then (2/3)*0.5*1 (weak students hired) + (1/3)*1*1 (excellent students hired) = 2/3.",

    "Analysis": "As the receiver, my goal is to maximize my expected payoff by hiring as many excellent students (s=1) as possible and avoiding hiring weak students (s=0). The sender (professor) has committed to a signaling scheme where they send signal 1 with probability 0.5 when the state is 0 (weak student) and always send signal 1 when the state is 1 (excellent student). Given this signaling scheme, I need to calculate the posterior beliefs for each signal and choose the action rule that maximizes my expected payoff. For signal 0, the posterior probability that the student is excellent is 0 (since x2=1 means signal 0 can only come from s=0). For signal 1, the posterior probability that the student is excellent is (1/3 * 1) / (1/3 * 1 + 2/3 * 0.5) = 0.5. My expected payoff for hiring (a=1) when signal=1 is 0.5 * 1 + 0.5 * (-1) = 0, which is the same as not hiring (a=0). Therefore, I am indifferent between hiring and not hiring when signal=1. However, to maximize my payoff, I should not hire when signal=0 (since the student is definitely weak) and can choose any probability for hiring when signal=1. For simplicity, I will choose not to hire when signal=1 as well to avoid any risk of hiring weak students.",

    "Analysis": "As the sender (professor), my goal is to maximize the number of students hired, regardless of their quality. The HR's goal is to hire excellent students and avoid weak ones. Given the prior state distribution (1/3 excellent, 2/3 weak), I need to design a signaling scheme that incentivizes the HR to hire as many students as possible. The HR will update their beliefs based on my signals and choose actions to maximize their expected payoff. To maximize my payoff, I should ensure that the HR's posterior belief after seeing a signal (recommendation) makes hiring optimal for them. Since the HR gets -1 for hiring a weak student and +1 for hiring an excellent one, they will only hire if the probability of the student being excellent given the signal is at least 0.5. Therefore, I should set x1 (probability of recommending a weak student) to 0, as recommending weak students would lead the HR to not hire. I should set x2 (probability of recommending an excellent student) to 1, as this perfectly signals excellence and ensures hiring. This strategy ensures that all recommended students are excellent, and the HR will always hire them, maximizing my payoff.",

The sender (professor) has committed to a signaling scheme where they always send signal 0 for weak students (x1=0) and always send signal 1 for excellent students (x2=1). This is a fully informative signaling scheme. Given this, I can infer the state perfectly from the signal: if signal=0, the student is weak (s=0), and if signal=1, the student is excellent (s=1). My optimal action rule is to hire only when the signal is 1 (y1=0, y2=1), as this maximizes my expected payoff by avoiding hiring weak students and only hiring excellent students.",

    "Analysis": "As the receiver (HR), my goal is to maximize my expected payoff by hiring as many excellent students as possible and avoiding hiring weak students. The professor (sender) aims to maximize the number of students hired, regardless of their quality. To incentivize the professor to reveal truthful information about student quality, I need to design a signaling scheme that aligns the professor's incentives with mine. Specifically, I will propose a signaling scheme where the professor always recommends excellent students (x2 = 1) and never recommends weak students (x1 = 0). This ensures that a recommendation (signal 1) is a credible indicator of excellence, and I can confidently hire based on it (y2 = 1). For non-recommendations (signal 0), I will not hire (y1 = 0) because the signal is uninformative and the prior probability of excellence is low (1/3). This scheme maximizes my expected payoff by ensuring I only hire excellent students.",

Given this, the receiver's best response will be to hire only when the signal is 1 (y2=1) and not hire when the signal is 0 (y1=0), because the signal is now perfectly informative of the student's quality. This maximizes the receiver's payoff by hiring only excellent students. Since the receiver is rational and self-interested, they will follow this action rule.

    "Analysis": "As the receiver (HR), my goal is to maximize my expected payoff by hiring as many excellent students (s=1) as possible while avoiding hiring weak students (s=0). The sender (professor) aims to maximize the number of students hired, regardless of their quality. To incentivize the sender to reveal truthful information, I need to design a signaling scheme φ₁ that aligns the sender's incentives with mine. The optimal strategy is to commit to a signaling scheme where the sender only recommends students who are excellent (x2=1) and does not recommend weak students (x1=0). This ensures that the signal σ=1 is credible, and I can hire based on this signal (y2=1) while ignoring the signal σ=0 (y1=0). This maximizes my expected payoff by hiring only excellent students and avoiding weak ones.",

    "Analysis": "As the sender (professor), my goal is to maximize the number of students hired, regardless of their quality. The proposer (receiver, HR) has committed to a signaling scheme where they always recommend weak students (s=0) with signal 0 (x1=0) and always recommend excellent students (s=1) with signal 1 (x2=1). Given this, the HR's best response is to hire only when the signal is 1 (y2=1) and not hire when the signal is 0 (y1=0), because the signal perfectly reveals the student's quality. However, this does not maximize my payoff, as weak students are never hired. To incentivize the HR to sometimes hire weak students, I need to introduce some noise in the signaling. But since the HR is rational and self-interested, they will not deviate from their optimal strategy. Therefore, the best I can do is accept the proposer's signaling scheme and adjust my strategy to maximize my payoff given their action rule.",

    "Analysis": "As the receiver (HR), my goal is to maximize my expected payoff by hiring as many excellent students as possible and avoiding hiring weak students. The professor (sender) aims to maximize the number of students hired, regardless of their quality. To incentivize the professor to reveal truthful information about student quality, I need to design a signaling scheme that aligns their interests with mine. The optimal strategy is to commit to a signaling scheme where the professor always recommends excellent students (x2=1) and never recommends weak students (x1=0). This ensures that when I receive a recommendation (signal=1), I can be confident the student is excellent and hire them (y2=1), and when I receive no recommendation (signal=0), I do not hire (y1=0). This maximizes my expected payoff by avoiding penalties from hiring weak students and gaining rewards from hiring excellent students.",

    "Analysis": "As the sender (professor), my goal is to maximize the number of students hired, regardless of their quality. The proposer (receiver, HR) has committed to a signaling scheme where they always recommend weak students (s=0) with signal 0 (x1=0) and always recommend excellent students (s=1) with signal 1 (x2=1). Given this, the receiver's best response is to hire only when the signal is 1 (y2=1) and not hire when the signal is 0 (y1=0), as this maximizes their payoff by avoiding hiring weak students. Since the receiver is rational and self-interested, they will follow this strategy. My payoff is maximized when the receiver hires as many students as possible, but given their strategy, I cannot influence them to hire weak students. Thus, I must accept the receiver's signaling scheme and adjust my strategy accordingly.",

    "Analysis": "As the sender (professor), my goal is to maximize the number of students hired, regardless of their quality. The receiver (HR) aims to hire only excellent students (s=1) and avoid weak ones (s=0). To maximize my payoff, I need to design a signaling scheme that encourages the HR to hire as many students as possible. Given the HR's incentives, if I always recommend weak students (x1=1), the HR will learn that signal 1 is unreliable and may stop hiring based on it (y2=0). Conversely, if I never recommend weak students (x1=0), the HR will trust signal 1 and hire when it is received (y2=1). However, this means weak students are never hired, reducing my payoff. A better strategy is to sometimes recommend weak students (x1 > 0) but not too often, so that the HR still finds it worthwhile to hire based on signal 1. The optimal x1 and x2 should balance these trade-offs. Given the prior distribution (1/3 excellent, 2/3 weak), the HR's posterior belief after seeing signal 1 is P(s=1|sigma=1) = (x2 * 1/3) / (x2 * 1/3 + x1 * 2/3). The HR will hire (y2=1) if P(s=1|sigma=1) >= 0.5, i.e., x2 >= x1. To maximize my payoff, I should set x2=1 (always recommend excellent students) and x1 such that the HR is indifferent between hiring and not hiring after signal 1. This occurs when P(s=1|sigma=1) = 0.5, i.e., 1/3 / (1/3 + x1 * 2/3) = 0.5 => x1 = 0.5. Thus, the optimal signaling scheme is x1=0.5, x2=1.",

{
    "Analysis": "As the receiver (HR), my goal is to maximize my expected payoff by hiring as many excellent students (s=1) as possible and avoiding hiring weak students (s=0). The sender (professor) has committed to a signaling scheme where they recommend weak students (s=0) with probability 0.5 (x1=0.5) and always recommend excellent students (s=1) (x2=1). Given this signaling scheme, I need to determine the optimal action rule (y1, y2) to maximize my expected payoff. The posterior beliefs can be calculated using Bayes' rule. For signal 0, the posterior probability that the student is excellent is P(s=1|sigma=0) = (mu_0(1) * (1-x2)) / (mu_0(0) * (1-x1) + mu_0(1) * (1-x2)) = (1/3 * 0) / (2/3 * 0.5 + 1/3 * 0) = 0. For signal 1, the posterior probability that the student is excellent is P(s=1|sigma=1) = (mu_0(1) * x2) / (mu_0(0) * x1 + mu_0(1) * x2) = (1/3 * 1) / (2/3 * 0.5 + 1/3 * 1) = 0.5. My expected payoff for hiring (a=1) given signal 0 is P(s=1|sigma=0) * 1 + P(s=0|sigma=0) * (-1) = 0 * 1 + 1 * (-1) = -1, which is worse than not hiring (0). For signal 1, my expected payoff for hiring is 0.5 * 1 + 0.5 * (-1) = 0, which is equal to not hiring (0). To maximize my payoff, I should never hire when the signal is 0 (y1=0) and can choose any probability for hiring when the signal is 1 (y2), since the expected payoff is the same. However, to avoid unnecessary risk, I will set y2=0.",

    "Analysis": "As the sender (professor), my goal is to maximize the number of students hired, regardless of their quality. The receiver (HR) aims to hire excellent students (s=1) and avoid hiring weak students (s=0). To maximize my payoff, I need to design a signaling scheme that incentivizes the HR to hire as many students as possible. Given the HR's preferences, the HR will only hire if the posterior probability that the student is excellent (s=1) is at least 0.5 (since the expected payoff for hiring is positive only if P(s=1|σ) ≥ 0.5). To achieve this, I can set x1 = 0 (never recommend weak students) and x2 = 1 (always recommend excellent students). This ensures that the HR will always hire when receiving signal σ=1 (since P(s=1|σ=1) = 1) and never hire when receiving σ=0 (since P(s=1|σ=0) = 0). This maximizes my expected payoff because all excellent students are hired, and no weak students are hired (but since I don't care about the quality, this is the best I can do given the HR's rationality).",

    "Analysis": "As the receiver (HR), my goal is to maximize my expected payoff by hiring as many excellent students (s=1) as possible and avoiding hiring weak students (s=0). The sender (professor) aims to maximize the number of students hired, regardless of their quality. To incentivize the sender to reveal truthful information about the students' quality, I need to design a signaling scheme that aligns the sender's incentives with mine. The optimal strategy is to commit to a signaling scheme where I only hire students when the signal is 1 (recommend) and the posterior probability that the student is excellent is high enough to justify the hire. Specifically, I will set y1 = 0 (no hire when signal is 0) and y2 = 1 (hire when signal is 1), provided the sender's signaling scheme ensures that the posterior probability of s=1 given signal 1 is at least 0.5 (to avoid negative expected payoff for me). The sender will then have an incentive to only recommend excellent students (x2 = 1) and not recommend weak students (x1 = 0), as this maximizes their payoff given my action rule.",

    "Analysis": "As the sender (professor), my goal is to maximize the number of students hired, regardless of their quality. The HR's goal is to hire excellent students and avoid weak ones. To maximize my payoff, I need to design a signaling scheme that incentivizes the HR to hire as many students as possible. Given the HR's preferences, if I always recommend students (x1=1, x2=1), the HR will not hire any students because the signal is uninformative and the prior probability of a weak student is high (2/3). To make the signal credible, I must ensure that the HR has a posterior belief that hiring is optimal when the signal is 1. This can be achieved by setting x2=1 (always recommend excellent students) and x1=0 (never recommend weak students). This way, the signal 1 is perfectly informative of an excellent student, and the HR will always hire when the signal is 1 (y2=1). The signal 0 is uninformative, but since the HR's prior belief for s=1 is 1/3, the HR will not hire when the signal is 0 (y1=0). This signaling scheme maximizes my expected payoff because all excellent students are hired, and no weak students are hired (but I don't gain from weak students being hired anyway).",

The sender (professor) has committed to a signaling scheme where they always send signal 0 for weak students (x1=0) and always send signal 1 for excellent students (x2=1). This is a fully informative signaling scheme. Given this, I can perfectly infer the state from the signal: if the signal is 0, the student is weak (s=0), and if the signal is 1, the student is excellent (s=1). My best response is to hire only when the signal is 1 (y1=0, y2=1), as this maximizes my payoff by ensuring I only hire excellent students and avoid weak ones.",

    "Analysis": "As the receiver (HR), my goal is to maximize my expected payoff by hiring as many excellent students (s=1) as possible and avoiding hiring weak students (s=0). The professor (sender) wants to maximize the number of students hired, regardless of their quality. To incentivize the professor to reveal truthful information about the students' quality, I need to design a signaling scheme that aligns the professor's incentives with mine. Specifically, I will propose a signaling scheme where the professor always recommends excellent students (x2=1) and never recommends weak students (x1=0). This ensures that when I receive a recommendation (signal=1), I can be confident the student is excellent and should be hired (y2=1). If no recommendation is given (signal=0), I will not hire the student (y1=0) because the prior probability of the student being excellent is low (1/3). This scheme maximizes my expected payoff by ensuring I only hire excellent students.",

    "Analysis": "As the sender (professor), my goal is to maximize the number of students hired, regardless of their quality. The receiver (HR) aims to hire excellent students and avoid hiring weak ones. Given the proposer's signaling scheme (x1=0, x2=1), the sender always sends signal 0 for weak students (s=0) and signal 1 for excellent students (s=1). This is a fully informative signaling scheme. The receiver, being rational, will infer the state perfectly from the signal. Thus, the receiver will hire only when the signal is 1 (excellent students) and not hire when the signal is 0 (weak students). This aligns with my goal because all excellent students (s=1) will be hired, and no weak students (s=0) will be hired. Since I get a reward of 1 for each hire, this scheme maximizes my expected payoff by ensuring all excellent students are hired.",

    "Analysis": "As the sender (professor), my goal is to maximize the number of students hired, regardless of their quality. The proposer (receiver, HR) has committed to a signaling scheme where they always recommend weak students (s=0) with signal 0 (x1=0) and always recommend excellent students (s=1) with signal 1 (x2=1). This is a fully informative signaling scheme. Given this, the receiver (HR) will update their beliefs based on the signals: if sigma=0, they know the student is weak (s=0), and if sigma=1, they know the student is excellent (s=1). The HR's optimal action rule is to hire only when sigma=1 (y1=0, y2=1), as hiring weak students gives them a penalty (-1) and hiring excellent students gives them a reward (1). Since the HR is rational and self-interested, they will follow this action rule. As the sender, I cannot deviate from the proposed signaling scheme because the HR will revert to ignoring my signals (pi_0) if I do not comply, which would result in fewer hires. Thus, the best response is to accept the proposed signaling scheme.",

    "Analysis": "As the sender (professor), my goal is to maximize the number of students hired, regardless of their quality. The HR (receiver) aims to hire excellent students (s=1) and avoid hiring weak students (s=0). To maximize my payoff, I need to design a signaling scheme that incentivizes the HR to hire as many students as possible. Given the HR's preferences, the HR will only hire if the posterior probability that the student is excellent (s=1) is at least 0.5 (since the expected payoff for hiring is positive only if P(s=1|σ) ≥ 0.5). To achieve this, I can set x2 = 1 (always recommend excellent students) and x1 = 0.5 (recommend weak students with probability 0.5). This ensures that when the HR sees σ=1, the posterior probability P(s=1|σ=1) = (1/3 * 1) / (1/3 * 1 + 2/3 * 0.5) = 0.5, making the HR indifferent between hiring and not hiring. The HR may choose to hire in this case, maximizing my expected payoff.",

    "Analysis": "As the receiver (HR), my goal is to maximize my expected payoff by hiring as many excellent students (s=1) as possible and avoiding hiring weak students (s=0). The sender (professor) has committed to a signaling scheme where they recommend weak students (s=0) with probability 0.5 (x1=0.5) and always recommend excellent students (s=1) (x2=1). Given this signaling scheme, I need to determine the optimal action rule (y1, y2) to maximize my expected payoff. The posterior probabilities can be calculated using Bayes' rule. For signal 0, the posterior probability that the student is excellent is P(s=1|sigma=0) = (mu_0(s=1) * (1-x2)) / (mu_0(s=0) * (1-x1) + mu_0(s=1) * (1-x2)) = (1/3 * 0) / (2/3 * 0.5 + 1/3 * 0) = 0. For signal 1, the posterior probability that the student is excellent is P(s=1|sigma=1) = (mu_0(s=1) * x2) / (mu_0(s=0) * x1 + mu_0(s=1) * x2) = (1/3 * 1) / (2/3 * 0.5 + 1/3 * 1) = 0.5. My expected payoff for hiring (a=1) given signal 0 is -1 * P(s=0|sigma=0) + 1 * P(s=1|sigma=0) = -1 * 1 + 1 * 0 = -1. For not hiring (a=0), it is 0. Thus, I should not hire when signal is 0 (y1=0). For signal 1, my expected payoff for hiring is -1 * P(s=0|sigma=1) + 1 * P(s=1|sigma=1) = -1 * 0.5 + 1 * 0.5 = 0. For not hiring, it is 0. Since the expected payoff is the same, I can choose any probability. To maximize my payoff, I should hire with probability 1 when signal is 1 (y2=1), as this aligns with my goal of hiring excellent students when there is no disadvantage.",
