The responder is also rational and self-interested, meaning they will accept any offer where their payoff (1-x) is greater than 0, since rejecting would give them nothing. To ensure acceptance and maximize my payoff, I should offer the smallest possible amount greater than 0 to the responder. However, in practice, the smallest increment is theoretically infinitesimal, so I propose to keep almost the entire amount, leaving the responder with just enough to incentivize acceptance.

    "Analysis": "As a self-interested rational proposer, my goal is to maximize my own payoff. The responder is also self-interested and rational, meaning they will accept any offer where their payoff (1-x) is greater than 0, since rejecting would give them 0. To ensure acceptance, I should offer the smallest possible amount that the responder would accept, which is just above 0. However, since the responder is rational, they will accept any (1-x) > 0. Therefore, the optimal strategy is to propose x = 1 - ε, where ε is an infinitesimally small amount. In practice, this means proposing x = 1 (keeping all the money for myself), as the responder would still prefer 0 over rejecting and getting 0, but this is a boundary case. The standard rational choice is to propose x just under 1, but since the responder is indifferent at x = 1, proposing x = 1 is the optimal strategy to maximize my payoff.",

    "Analysis": "As a self-interested rational proposer, my goal is to maximize my own payoff. The responder is also self-interested and rational, meaning they will accept any offer where their payoff (1 - x) is greater than 0, since rejecting the offer would result in a payoff of 0. Therefore, the optimal strategy is to offer the smallest possible amount that the responder would still accept, which is an infinitesimally small amount above 0. In practice, this means proposing to keep almost the entire amount for myself, leaving the responder with just enough to incentivize acceptance. Since the responder is rational, they will accept any x < 1. Thus, the optimal decision is to propose x = 1 - ε, where ε is a very small positive number. For simplicity, we can approximate this as x = 1.",

The responder is also rational and self-interested, meaning they will accept any offer where their payoff (1-x) is greater than 0, since rejecting would give them nothing.

Since the responder is rational, they would accept any x < 1, as (1-x) > 0. Therefore, I can propose x = 0.999..., effectively keeping almost the entire amount for myself while leaving the responder with an infinitesimal amount they would still accept.

The responder is also rational and self-interested, so they will accept any offer where their payoff (1-x) is greater than 0, since rejecting would give them nothing. To ensure acceptance while maximizing my payoff, I should offer the smallest possible amount that the responder would still accept. Given that the responder is rational, they would accept any x < 1, but at x = 1, they are indifferent. However, since even a tiny positive amount is better than nothing, the optimal strategy is to propose x = 1 - ε, where ε is the smallest possible positive amount. In practice, this means proposing x = 1, but since x must be <= 1, the optimal decision is x = 1, knowing the responder will accept because (1-1) = 0 is technically the same as rejecting, but rational self-interest would drive them to accept to avoid conflict or due to indifference. However, in strict game theory terms, the responder would reject x = 1. Therefore, the optimal x is just below 1, but since we must choose a real number, x = 0.999 is practically equivalent and ensures acceptance.",
