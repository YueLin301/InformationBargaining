The responder is also self-interested and rational, meaning they will accept any offer where their payoff (1-x) is greater than 0, since rejecting would give them 0. To ensure acceptance, I should offer the smallest possible positive amount to the responder, which is infinitesimally greater than 0. However, in practice, the smallest meaningful amount is 0, but offering 0 would be rejected. Therefore, the optimal strategy is to offer x = 1 - ε, where ε is the smallest positive amount the responder would accept. Since the responder is rational, they will accept any (1-x) > 0, so the optimal x is arbitrarily close to 1. For practical purposes, x = 1 is the limit, but since (1-x) = 0 would be rejected, the optimal x is just below 1. Given the constraints, the best choice is x = 0.999..., but for simplicity, we can approximate this as x = 1, knowing the responder would reject if (1-x) = 0. However, since the responder is rational and prefers any positive amount over nothing, the optimal x is the largest possible where (1-x) is the smallest positive amount.

    "Analysis": "As a self-interested rational proposer, my goal is to maximize my own payoff. The responder is also self-interested and rational, meaning they will accept any offer where their payoff (1-x) is greater than 0, since rejecting would give them 0. The smallest amount the responder would accept is an infinitesimally small positive amount, but in practice, any x < 1 would be accepted. Therefore, to maximize my payoff, I should propose x = 1 - ε, where ε is the smallest possible positive amount. However, since the game is played once and roles are fixed for future interactions, the responder has no incentive to reject any positive offer. Thus, the optimal decision is to propose x = 1, leaving (1-x) = 0 for the responder. The responder would still accept because rejecting gives them 0, and accepting also gives them 0, but rationality implies indifference, and accepting is weakly dominant.",

    "Analysis": "As a self-interested rational proposer, my goal is to maximize my own payoff. The responder is also self-interested and rational, meaning they will accept any offer that leaves them with a positive payoff (i.e., (1-x) > 0). To ensure acceptance, I should offer the smallest possible amount that the responder would accept, which is an infinitesimally small amount greater than 0. However, since the game is played once (though with potential future interactions implied by the same role assignment), the responder has no incentive to reject any positive offer. Therefore, I can maximize my payoff by keeping almost the entire amount, leaving the responder with an epsilon amount. In practice, this means x can be set to 1, leaving 0 for the responder, but since the responder would reject x=1 (as (1-x)=0 is not strictly positive), the optimal x is the largest value less than 1. For simplicity, we can approximate this as x = 0.999..., but in a discrete setting, x = 0.99 is a practical choice.",

The responder is also self-interested and rational, meaning they will accept any offer where their payoff (1-x) is greater than 0, since rejecting would give them 0. To ensure acceptance, I should offer the smallest possible amount greater than 0, but since the responder can accept 0 (indifferent between accepting and rejecting), I can propose x = 1, keeping all for myself. However, in practice, the responder might reject x = 1 because they get nothing. To guarantee acceptance, I should offer an infinitesimally small amount (1-x) > 0. For simplicity, I choose x = 0.999, leaving 0.001 for the responder, which they will accept because it is better than 0.",

    "Analysis": "As a self-interested rational proposer, my goal is to maximize my own payoff. The responder is also self-interested and rational, meaning they will accept any offer where their payoff (1-x) is greater than 0, since rejecting would give them 0. To ensure acceptance, I should offer the smallest possible amount that the responder would accept, which is any (1-x) > 0. However, since x and (1-x) are continuous, the optimal strategy is to offer x = 1 - ε, where ε is an infinitesimally small positive number, effectively making the responder indifferent between accepting and rejecting but slightly favoring acceptance. In practice, this means proposing x = 1, leaving (1-x) = 0 for the responder. The responder, being rational, would reject this offer because (1-x) = 0 is not better than rejecting (which also gives 0). Therefore, the optimal offer is x = 1 - ε, where ε is the smallest possible amount that ensures (1-x) > 0. For simplicity, we can approximate this as x = 0.999..., but in a discrete or practical setting, the proposer would choose x as close to 1 as possible without making (1-x) = 0. Given the constraints, the optimal decision is x = 1, but this would lead to rejection. Thus, the equilibrium is to propose x slightly less than 1, ensuring acceptance. Here, I choose x = 0.99, leaving (1-x) = 0.01 for the responder, which they would accept because 0.01 > 0.",

 Now the proposer decides that x=0.99.
