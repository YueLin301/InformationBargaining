However, since x can be exactly 0.5, and the responder gets 0 at x=0.5, they are indifferent between accepting and rejecting. A rational responder might reject x=0.5 to avoid getting nothing, but since they are indifferent, they could also accept. To ensure acceptance, I should propose x slightly less than 0.5, but since x is a real number, I can propose x=0.5 and rely on the responder's rationality to accept, as rejecting gives them nothing and accepting gives them 0, which is the same.

Since accepting gives me the same payoff as rejecting (0), but rejecting ensures the proposer also gets nothing, which could be seen as a form of fairness enforcement. However, as a purely self-interested player, I am indifferent between the two outcomes since my payoff is the same. But rejecting could signal disapproval of unfair offers, though this is irrelevant in a one-shot game. Given the strict rationality and self-interest, either choice is valid, but rejecting aligns with the principle of not accepting a strictly worse offer (though here it's equal).",

    "Analysis": "As the proposer, my goal is to maximize my own payoff. The responder is also self-interested and rational, so they will accept any offer where their payoff (1-2*x)/3 is greater than 0, since rejecting gives them 0. The responder will accept any x < 0.5, as (1-2*x)/3 > 0 for x < 0.5. To maximize my payoff (1+2*x)/3, I should choose the highest x that the responder will accept, which is just under 0.5. However, since x can be exactly 0.5, and the responder would get (1-2*0.5)/3 = 0, they are indifferent between accepting and rejecting. But since they are self-interested, they might accept to get at least something, but the problem states they are rational and self-interested, so they might reject to avoid giving me a higher payoff. To ensure acceptance, I should choose x slightly less than 0.5, but since x is a real number, the optimal choice is x = 0.5, knowing that the responder might still accept. If they reject, I get 0, but if they accept, I get (1+2*0.5)/3 = 2/3, which is the maximum possible. Given the risk of rejection, but knowing the responder is rational, they might accept to avoid getting nothing, so I choose x = 0.5.",

    "Analysis": "As a self-interested rational proposer, my goal is to maximize my expected payoff. The responder is also self-interested and rational, meaning they will accept any offer where their payoff $(1-2*x)/3$ is greater than or equal to 0. The responder's payoff is maximized when $x$ is minimized, so the responder would prefer $x = 0$. However, as the proposer, I want to maximize my payoff $(1+2*x)/3$, which increases with $x$. The responder will accept any $x$ where $(1-2*x)/3 >= 0$, which simplifies to $x <= 0.5$. Since the responder is rational, they will accept any $x <= 0.5$. To maximize my payoff, I should choose the highest $x$ within the range $0 <= x <= 0.5$, which is $x = 0.5$. This gives me the maximum possible payoff of $(1+2*0.5)/3 = 2/3$, while the responder gets $(1-2*0.5)/3 = 0$, which they will accept because it is not negative.",

    "Analysis": "As a self-interested rational proposer, my goal is to maximize my own payoff. The responder is also self-interested and rational, so they will accept any offer where their payoff (1-2*x)/3 is greater than 0, i.e., x < 0.5. Since x <= 0.5, the responder will accept any x < 0.5. To maximize my payoff (1+2*x)/3, I should choose the highest possible x that the responder will accept, which is just below 0.5. However, since x can be exactly 0.5, and the responder gets 0 at x=0.5, they are indifferent. A rational responder might accept x=0.5 to avoid getting nothing. Therefore, I will propose x=0.5 to maximize my payoff.",
