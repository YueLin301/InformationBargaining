    "Analysis": "As the proposer, my goal is to maximize my own payoff. The responder is rational and self-interested, so they will accept any offer where their payoff (1-x) is greater than or equal to their alternative (which is 0, since rejecting gives them nothing). To ensure acceptance, I should offer the smallest possible (1-x) that the responder would still accept, which is just above 0. However, since the responder is rational, they would accept any (1-x) > 0. Therefore, I can maximize my payoff by proposing x = 1 - ε, where ε is an infinitesimally small positive number. In practice, this means proposing x = 1, but since x must be <= 1, the optimal proposal is x = 1. The responder would accept because (1-1) = 0 is still not worse than rejecting (which also gives 0).",

Since the responder is rational and self-interested, they will accept any offer where their payoff (1-x) is greater than or equal to 0. The minimal acceptable offer for the responder is x = 1, where they get 0. However, offering x = 1 would leave me with the maximum payoff of 1, but the responder would be indifferent between accepting or rejecting (since they get 0 either way). To ensure acceptance, I should offer the smallest x such that the responder's payoff is just above 0. In practice, this means offering x slightly less than 1, but since the responder is rational, they will accept any x <= 1. Therefore, the optimal strategy is to offer x = 1, maximizing my payoff while still ensuring the responder has no incentive to reject (since rejecting gives them 0, same as accepting).",

    "Analysis": "As the proposer, my goal is to maximize my own payoff. Since the responder is also self-interested and rational, they will accept any offer where their payoff (1 - x) is greater than or equal to their alternative (which is 0 if they reject). Therefore, the responder will accept any offer where x <= 1. To maximize my payoff, I should propose the highest x that the responder will still accept, which is x = 1. However, if I propose x = 1, the responder gets 0, which is equal to rejecting, so they might reject. To ensure acceptance, I can propose x = 1 - ε, where ε is a very small positive number. In practice, the rational choice is x = 1, but to account for the possibility of rejection, I will propose x = 0.999, which is effectively the maximum possible payoff for me while ensuring the responder has a negligible but positive incentive to accept.",

This maximizes my payoff while ensuring the responder accepts the offer (since 1-x = ε > 0). In practice, this means setting x as close to 1 as possible without being rejected.

The responder is rational and self-interested, so they will accept any offer where their payoff (1-x) is greater than or equal to their alternative (which is 0, since rejecting gives them nothing). To ensure acceptance, I should offer the smallest possible (1-x) that the responder would accept, which is just above 0. However, since the responder is rational, they will accept any (1-x) > 0. Therefore, I can maximize my payoff by setting x as close to 1 as possible, leaving the responder with just enough to make acceptance preferable to rejection. In practice, this means setting x = 1 - ε, where ε is an infinitesimally small amount. For simplicity, I will set x = 1, knowing that the responder will accept any (1-x) >= 0, and 0 is the threshold.",

The responder is also self-interested and rational, meaning they will accept any offer where their payoff (1-x) is greater than or equal to their minimal acceptable threshold. Since the responder gets nothing if they reject, their minimal threshold is 0. However, to ensure acceptance, I should offer the smallest possible amount that the responder would accept, which is an infinitesimally small amount above 0. In practice, this means offering x = 1 - ε, where ε is a very small positive number. For simplicity, I will choose x = 1, but in reality, the responder would reject x = 1 because they get 0. Therefore, the optimal offer is x just below 1, but since the responder is rational and prefers any positive amount over nothing, the equilibrium is x = 1 - ε.

    "Analysis": "As the proposer, my goal is to maximize my own payoff. Since the responder is also self-interested and rational, they will accept any offer where their payoff (1-x) is greater than or equal to 0. The minimal acceptable offer for the responder is 1-x >= 0, which implies x <= 1. However, to maximize my payoff, I should propose the highest x that the responder will still accept. The responder will accept any x <= 1, but since x can be up to 1, the optimal x for me is 1, as the responder would get 0 and be indifferent between accepting or rejecting. However, since rejecting gives them 0, a rational responder might reject x=1. To ensure acceptance, I should propose x slightly less than 1, but in practice, the highest x that guarantees acceptance is x = 1 - ε, where ε is infinitesimally small. For simplicity, I will propose x = 0.999, which the responder will accept because 1 - 0.999 = 0.001 > 0.",

    "Analysis": "As the proposer, my goal is to maximize my own payoff. The responder is rational and self-interested, so they will accept any offer where their payoff (1-x) is greater than or equal to 0. Since the responder gets nothing if they reject, they will accept any x <= 1. To maximize my payoff, I should propose x = 1, leaving nothing for the responder. However, the responder might reject x = 1 because their payoff would be 0, which is equivalent to rejecting. To ensure acceptance, I should propose x slightly less than 1, such as x = 0.99, leaving the responder with a negligible but positive payoff (0.01). This maximizes my expected payoff while ensuring the responder accepts.",

Proposal:
 Now the proposer decides that x=0.99.
