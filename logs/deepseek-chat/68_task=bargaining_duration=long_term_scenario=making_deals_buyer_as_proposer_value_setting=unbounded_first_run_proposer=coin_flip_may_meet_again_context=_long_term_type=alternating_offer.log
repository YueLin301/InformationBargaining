    "Analysis": "As the proposer, my goal is to maximize my own payoff. Since the responder is also self-interested and rational, they will accept any offer where their payoff (1-x) is greater than or equal to what they could expect to get by rejecting the offer and becoming the proposer in the next round. Given the game has a 0.1 probability of stopping each round and a hard stop at timestep 10, the responder's expected future payoff diminishes over time. The optimal strategy is to offer the responder just enough to make them indifferent between accepting now and risking rejection, which is slightly more than their expected future payoff. Given the initial timestep and the probability of the game continuing, the optimal offer is x = 0.9, leaving the responder with 0.1, which is the minimal amount they might accept given the risk of the game ending.",

However, there is also a 0.1 chance the game ends immediately, and I get nothing. Given that both players are rational, if I become the proposer, I would offer the minimal amount the responder would accept, which is likely close to 0.5 in equilibrium. However, the risk of the game ending and getting nothing must be weighed against the small but certain payoff of 0.1 now.

    "Analysis": "As the proposer, my goal is to maximize my own payoff. Given that the previous offer of x=0.9 was rejected, I need to propose a more favorable offer to the responder to increase the chance of acceptance. Since both players are rational and self-interested, the responder will accept any offer where (1-x) is at least as good as their expected payoff from rejecting and becoming the proposer in the next round. Given the 0.1 probability of the game ending at each step and the timestep limit of 10, the responder's expected payoff from rejecting is discounted by these factors. A reasonable offer would be x=0.5, which splits the surplus equally and is likely to be accepted by a rational responder.",

The optimal strategy is to offer the responder just enough to make them indifferent between accepting now and rejecting to potentially get a better offer later.

However, there is a 0.1 probability the game will end immediately, and even if it continues, the timestep is 0, so there are up to 10 rounds left. Given the high probability of the game continuing, rejecting the offer and hoping for a better deal as the proposer is a rational strategy.

    "Analysis": "As the proposer, my goal is to maximize my own payoff. Since the responder is also self-interested and rational, they will accept any offer where their payoff (1-x) is greater than what they could expect to get by rejecting and becoming the proposer in the next round. Given the 0.1 probability of the game stopping each round and the timestep limit of 10, the responder's expected future payoff diminishes over time. Therefore, I should propose an x that leaves the responder with just enough to make accepting now better than waiting. Given the game could end at any time, the responder's best alternative is uncertain, so a reasonable initial offer is x = 0.5, which splits the surplus equally and is likely to be accepted immediately.",

However, the game may end due to timeout (0.1 chance) or reach timestep 10, resulting in zero payoff. Given the high likelihood of the game continuing, I must consider future negotiations. However, the proposer's high demand (x=0.9) suggests they are unlikely to offer more in future rounds.

Since the responder is also self-interested and rational, they will accept any offer where their payoff (1-x) is greater than or equal to what they could expect to get by rejecting and becoming the proposer in the next round. Given the 0.1 probability of the game stopping after each round, the responder's expected future payoff is discounted. The optimal strategy is to offer the responder just enough to make them indifferent between accepting now and rejecting to become the proposer.

However, there is also a 0.1 probability the game ends immediately, resulting in a payoff of 0. Given that both players are rational, if I become the proposer, the optimal offer I can make is x=1 (keeping all for myself), which the responder would accept because getting 0 is worse than any positive amount. However, the expected payoff of rejecting is 0.9 * (probability of becoming proposer and getting 1) + 0.1 * 0 = 0.9 * 1 = 0.9. But this is not guaranteed, as the game could end prematurely. Comparing the immediate payoff of 0.5 to the uncertain expected payoff of 0.9, the rational choice is to accept the current offer of 0.5, as it provides a certain and reasonable payoff.",

    "Analysis": "As the proposer, my goal is to maximize my own payoff. Since the responder is also self-interested and rational, they will accept any offer where their payoff (1-x) is greater than or equal to what they could expect to get if they reject the offer and become the proposer in the next round. Given the game has a 0.1 probability of stopping each round and a hard stop at timestep 10, the responder's expected future payoff diminishes over time. At timestep 0, the optimal strategy is to offer the responder just enough to make them indifferent between accepting now and waiting for a future offer. Given the symmetry and the risk of the game ending, the optimal offer is x = 0.5, which splits the surplus equally and is likely to be accepted immediately.",

 Now the proposer decides that x=0.5.

    "Analysis": "As the proposer, my goal is to maximize my own payoff. Since the responder is also self-interested and rational, they will accept any offer where their payoff (1-x) is greater than or equal to what they could expect to get in future rounds. Given the game has a 0.1 probability of stopping each round and a hard stop at timestep 10, the responder's expected future payoff diminishes over time. The optimal strategy is to offer the responder just enough to make them indifferent between accepting now and waiting for a future offer. Given the game could end at any time, the responder's expected future payoff is low, so I can offer a small (1-x). A reasonable offer is x = 0.9, leaving the responder with 0.1, which they should accept because the risk of the game ending or future offers being worse is high.",
