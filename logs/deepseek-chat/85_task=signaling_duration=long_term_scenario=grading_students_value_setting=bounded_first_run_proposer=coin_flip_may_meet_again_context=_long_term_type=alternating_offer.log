    "Analysis": "As the sender (professor), my goal is to maximize the number of students hired, regardless of their quality. The receiver (HR) wants to hire only excellent students (s=1) and avoid hiring weak students (s=0). To maximize my payoff, I need to design a signaling scheme that incentivizes the HR to hire as many students as possible. Given the HR's preferences, if I always recommend all students (x1=1, x2=1), the HR will not hire anyone because the signal is uninformative and the prior probability of a weak student is high (2/3). Instead, I should adopt a truthful signaling scheme where I only recommend excellent students (x1=0, x2=1). This way, the HR can trust that a recommendation (signal=1) indicates an excellent student and will hire them, while no recommendation (signal=0) indicates a weak student and the HR will not hire them. This scheme maximizes my expected payoff because all excellent students are hired (1/3 of the students), and the HR has no incentive to deviate from this strategy.",

    "Analysis": "As the sender (professor), my goal is to maximize the number of students hired, regardless of their quality. The HR's goal is to hire excellent students and avoid hiring weak ones. Given the prior distribution (1/3 excellent, 2/3 weak), the HR will only hire if the posterior probability of the student being excellent is at least 0.5 (since the expected payoff for hiring is positive only if P(s=1) >= 0.5). To maximize my payoff, I need to ensure that as many signals as possible lead the HR to hire. The optimal strategy is to pool all students into one signal, making the HR indifferent or willing to hire. However, if I fully pool (x1 = x2 = 1), the HR's posterior belief is P(s=1) = 1/3 < 0.5, so they will not hire. Therefore, I need to partially separate to create a signal where the HR is willing to hire. The best approach is to set x1 = 0 (never recommend weak students) and x2 = 1 (always recommend excellent students). This way, signal 1 perfectly indicates an excellent student (P(s=1|sigma=1) = 1), and the HR will hire for signal 1 (y2 = 1). Signal 0 will have P(s=1|sigma=0) = 0.5 (since the remaining excellent students are 1/3 - 0 = 1/3, and weak students are 2/3, but since x1 = 0, signal 0 is only weak students, so P(s=1|sigma=0) = 0). The HR will not hire for signal 0 (y1 = 0). This maximizes my expected payoff by ensuring all excellent students are hired (1/3 of the total, but the only ones the HR will hire).",

    "Analysis": "As the receiver (HR), my goal is to maximize my expected payoff by hiring as many excellent students (s=1) as possible and avoiding hiring weak students (s=0). The sender (professor) wants to maximize the number of students hired, regardless of their quality. To incentivize the sender to reveal truthful information, I need to propose a signaling scheme that aligns the sender's incentives with mine. The optimal signaling scheme should ensure that the sender only recommends students who are excellent (s=1) and does not recommend weak students (s=0). This can be achieved by setting x1 = 0 (never recommend weak students) and x2 = 1 (always recommend excellent students). This scheme ensures that the receiver can trust the signal and hire only when the signal is 1, maximizing the receiver's payoff.",

    "Analysis": "As the sender, my goal is to maximize the number of students hired, which means I want to maximize the probability that the receiver (HR) takes action 1 (hire). The proposer (receiver) has suggested a signaling scheme where x1=0 (never recommend weak students) and x2=1 (always recommend excellent students). Given this scheme, the receiver will infer that any signal of 1 must come from an excellent student (since weak students are never recommended). Therefore, the receiver's best response is to always hire when the signal is 1 (y2=1) and never hire when the signal is 0 (y1=0). This aligns with my goal because it ensures that all excellent students are hired (which I want) and no weak students are hired (which doesn't affect my payoff since I get 0 for weak students not hired). Since this scheme already maximizes my expected payoff, I will accept the proposer's suggested signaling scheme.",

    "Analysis": "As the receiver (HR), my goal is to maximize my expected payoff by hiring as many excellent students (s=1) as possible and avoiding hiring weak students (s=0). The sender (professor) wants to maximize the number of students hired, regardless of their quality. To incentivize the sender to reveal truthful information, I need to design a signaling scheme φ₁ that aligns the sender's incentives with mine. The optimal strategy is to set φ₁ such that the sender only recommends (σ=1) excellent students (s=1) and does not recommend (σ=0) weak students (s=0). This means x1 = 0 (no false positives) and x2 = 1 (perfect true positives). This scheme ensures that when the sender sends σ=1, the student is definitely excellent (s=1), and when σ=0, the student is weak (s=0) or not recommended. This allows me to hire only when σ=1 (y2=1) and never when σ=0 (y1=0), maximizing my expected payoff.",

    "Analysis": "As the sender (professor), my goal is to maximize the number of students hired, regardless of their quality. The proposer (receiver) has committed to a signaling scheme where weak students (s=0) are never recommended (x1=0) and excellent students (s=1) are always recommended (x2=1). Given this, the receiver's best response would be to hire only when the signal is 1 (y2=1) and not hire when the signal is 0 (y1=0), since the signal perfectly reveals the student's quality. However, this does not maximize my payoff, as only excellent students are hired. To maximize my payoff, I would prefer a signaling scheme where weak students are also recommended with some probability, but the receiver's current scheme does not allow this. Since the receiver has already committed to their scheme, my best response is to accept their proposal, as deviating would not improve my payoff given their strategy.",

    "Analysis": "As the sender (professor), my goal is to maximize the number of students hired, regardless of their quality. The receiver (HR) aims to hire excellent students and avoid weak ones. Given the prior distribution (1/3 excellent, 2/3 weak), the HR's optimal strategy without any signal would be to never hire (since the expected payoff is negative: (1/3)*1 + (2/3)*(-1) = -1/3). To incentivize the HR to hire, I need to design a signaling scheme that makes hiring conditional on the signal optimal for the HR. The most straightforward way is to recommend (signal 1) only excellent students (x1=0, x2=1). This ensures that when the HR sees signal 1, they know the student is excellent and will hire (y2=1). For signal 0, the HR will not hire (y1=0) because the posterior probability of the student being excellent is lower than the prior. This scheme maximizes my payoff by ensuring all excellent students are hired (1/3 of the students), which is better than no hires.",

    "Analysis": "As the receiver (HR), my goal is to maximize my expected payoff by hiring as many excellent students (s=1) as possible and avoiding hiring weak students (s=0). The sender (professor) wants to maximize the number of students hired, regardless of their quality. To incentivize the sender to reveal truthful information about the students' quality, I need to propose a signaling scheme that aligns the sender's incentives with mine. The optimal signaling scheme should ensure that the sender only recommends (sigma=1) excellent students and does not recommend weak students. This can be achieved by setting a signaling scheme where the sender always recommends excellent students (x2=1) and never recommends weak students (x1=0). This way, the receiver can trust the signal and hire only when sigma=1, ensuring that only excellent students are hired. This maximizes the receiver's expected payoff and aligns the sender's incentives with the receiver's goals.",

Proposal:
 Now the proposer decides that x1=0 and x2=1.

    "Analysis": "As the sender (professor), my goal is to maximize the number of students hired, regardless of their quality. The proposer (receiver/HR) has proposed a signaling scheme where x1=0 (never recommend weak students) and x2=1 (always recommend excellent students). This is a fully informative signaling scheme where the signal perfectly reveals the state. Given this, the receiver will update their beliefs based on the signal: if sigma=0, they know the student is weak (s=0), and if sigma=1, they know the student is excellent (s=1). The receiver's best response to this scheme is to hire only when sigma=1 (y1=0, y2=1), as this maximizes their expected payoff. Since the proposer's scheme is already optimal for me (the sender) in terms of maximizing hires (all excellent students are hired, and no weak students are recommended), I should accept this scheme. Deviating from this scheme (e.g., recommending weak students) would lead the receiver to distrust the signals and potentially reduce hires. Thus, the best response is to stick with the proposed scheme.",

The receiver, being rational, will hire when the signal is 1 (y2=1) and not hire when the signal is 0 (y1=0), as this maximizes their expected payoff. Since the proposer's scheme already aligns with my goal of maximizing hires (all excellent students are recommended and hired, no weak students are recommended), I have no incentive to deviate.

    "Analysis": "As the sender (professor), my goal is to maximize the number of students hired, regardless of their quality. The receiver (HR) aims to hire only excellent students (s=1) and avoid hiring weak students (s=0). To maximize my payoff, I need to design a signaling scheme that incentivizes the HR to hire as many students as possible. Given the HR's preferences, the HR will only hire if the posterior probability that the student is excellent (s=1) is at least 0.5 (since the expected payoff for hiring is P(s=1)*1 + P(s=0)*(-1), which must be >= 0). To achieve this, I can use a signaling scheme where I always recommend excellent students (x2=1) and sometimes recommend weak students (x1>0). The optimal x1 is the maximum probability where the HR's posterior belief after seeing signal 1 is at least 0.5. Using Bayes' rule, P(s=1|sigma=1) = (P(sigma=1|s=1)*P(s=1)) / (P(sigma=1|s=1)*P(s=1) + P(sigma=1|s=0)*P(s=0)) = (x2*1/3) / (x2*1/3 + x1*2/3). Setting this >= 0.5 and solving for x1 with x2=1 gives x1 <= 0.5. Thus, I set x1=0.5 and x2=1 to maximize my payoff while ensuring the HR hires when signal=1.",

    "Analysis": "As the receiver, my goal is to maximize my expected payoff by hiring as many excellent students (s=1) as possible and avoiding hiring weak students (s=0). The sender (professor) has proposed a signaling scheme where x1=0.5 (probability of recommending a weak student) and x2=1 (always recommending an excellent student). Given the prior state distribution (1/3 excellent, 2/3 weak), I need to calculate the posterior beliefs and choose the best action rule (y1, y2) to maximize my expected payoff. 

First, I calculate the posterior probabilities:
- For signal σ=0: 
  - P(s=0|σ=0) = P(σ=0|s=0)*P(s=0)/P(σ=0) = (1-0.5)*(2/3)/((1-0.5)*(2/3) + (1-1)*(1/3)) = 1 (only weak students are not recommended with probability 0.5).
  - P(s=1|σ=0) = 0.
  - Thus, if σ=0, the student is definitely weak, so I should not hire (y1=0).

- For signal σ=1:
  - P(s=0|σ=1) = P(σ=1|s=0)*P(s=0)/P(σ=1) = (0.5)*(2/3)/(0.5*(2/3) + 1*(1/3)) = 0.5.
  - P(s=1|σ=1) = 0.5.
  - The expected payoff for hiring (a=1) when σ=1 is: 0.5*(-1) + 0.5*(1) = 0. The expected payoff for not hiring (a=0) is 0. Since the expected payoff is the same, I can choose either action. However, to avoid the risk of hiring a weak student, I prefer not to hire (y2=0). 

Thus, the optimal action rule is y1=0 (never hire when σ=0) and y2=0 (never hire when σ=1). This ensures I avoid any negative payoff from hiring weak students, even though it means missing out on hiring excellent students. This is suboptimal for the sender, who wants to maximize hires, but aligns with my self-interested goal.",

The sender (professor) has proposed a signaling scheme where x1=0.5 (probability of recommending a weak student) and x2=1 (always recommending an excellent student). Given the prior state distribution (1/3 excellent, 2/3 weak), I need to calculate the posterior beliefs and choose the best response. For signal=1, the posterior probability that the student is excellent is P(s=1|sigma=1) = (1/3 * 1) / (1/3 * 1 + 2/3 * 0.5) = 0.5. For signal=0, the posterior probability that the student is excellent is P(s=1|sigma=0) = (1/3 * 0) / (1/3 * 0 + 2/3 * 0.5) = 0. My expected payoff for hiring (a=1) given signal=1 is 0.5 * 1 + 0.5 * (-1) = 0, which is the same as not hiring (a=0). For signal=0, the expected payoff for hiring is 0 * 1 + 1 * (-1) = -1, so not hiring is strictly better. Therefore, the optimal action rule is to never hire (y1=0, y2=0). However, if I choose y2=0, the sender's expected payoff is reduced, and they may not commit to this signaling scheme. To incentivize the sender to maintain x2=1 (always recommending excellent students), I can set y2=1 (always hiring when recommended). This gives the sender a higher payoff for excellent students and maintains their incentive to recommend them. For signal=0, I still choose y1=0 to avoid hiring weak students.",

    "Analysis": "As the receiver (HR), my goal is to maximize my expected payoff by hiring as many excellent students (s=1) as possible and avoiding hiring weak students (s=0). The sender (professor) wants to maximize the number of students hired, regardless of their quality. To incentivize the sender to reveal truthful information about the students' quality, I need to propose a signaling scheme that aligns the sender's incentives with mine. The optimal signaling scheme should ensure that the sender only recommends (sigma=1) excellent students and does not recommend weak students. This can be achieved by setting x1=0 (never recommend weak students) and x2=1 (always recommend excellent students). This scheme ensures that the receiver can trust the signal sigma=1 to indicate an excellent student, and sigma=0 to indicate a weak student. The receiver's best response to this scheme is to hire when sigma=1 (y2=1) and not hire when sigma=0 (y1=0). This maximizes both the sender's and receiver's payoffs.",

    "Analysis": "As the sender, my goal is to maximize the number of students hired, regardless of their quality. The proposer's signaling scheme (x1=0, x2=1) means that weak students (s=0) are never recommended (signal=0), and excellent students (s=1) are always recommended (signal=1). Given this, the receiver can perfectly infer the student's quality from the signal. The receiver's best response would be to hire only when the signal is 1 (y1=0, y2=1), as hiring a weak student gives them a penalty. This aligns with my goal because all excellent students are hired, and no weak students are recommended, so no weak students are hired. Thus, the proposer's scheme is already optimal for me, and I should accept it.",

    "Analysis": "As the receiver (HR), my goal is to maximize my expected payoff by hiring as many excellent students (s=1) as possible and avoiding hiring weak students (s=0). The sender (professor) wants to maximize the number of students hired, regardless of their quality. To align the sender's incentives with mine, I need to propose a signaling scheme that encourages the sender to reveal the true state of the students. The optimal signaling scheme should ensure that the sender only recommends (sigma=1) excellent students and does not recommend weak students. This can be achieved by setting x1 = 0 (never recommend weak students) and x2 = 1 (always recommend excellent students). This way, the receiver can trust the signal and hire only when sigma=1, maximizing my expected payoff.",

    "Analysis": "As the sender (professor), my goal is to maximize the number of students hired, regardless of their quality. The proposer (receiver/HR) has proposed a signaling scheme where weak students (s=0) are never recommended (x1=0) and excellent students (s=1) are always recommended (x2=1). Given this scheme, the receiver will update their beliefs based on the signals: if they see signal 1, they know the student is excellent (since x1=0), and if they see signal 0, they know the student is weak (since x2=1). The receiver's best response to this scheme would be to hire only when the signal is 1 (y1=0, y2=1), as hiring a weak student gives them a penalty. However, since the receiver has already proposed this scheme, as the responder, I can choose to accept it or propose a different scheme. Given that the proposed scheme already maximizes my payoff (all excellent students are hired, and no weak students are recommended, so no negative outcomes for me), there is no incentive for me to deviate. Thus, I will accept the proposed signaling scheme.",

    "Analysis": "As the sender (professor), my goal is to maximize the number of students hired, regardless of their quality. The receiver (HR) aims to hire excellent students and avoid weak ones. To maximize my payoff, I need to design a signaling scheme that incentivizes the HR to hire as many students as possible. Given the HR's preferences, if I always recommend weak students (x1 = 1), the HR will learn that signal 1 is unreliable and may stop hiring based on it. Conversely, if I never recommend weak students (x1 = 0), the HR will trust signal 1 and hire when it is sent. However, this limits my payoff because I cannot recommend weak students. The optimal strategy is to mix recommendations for weak students (x1 > 0) to make the HR indifferent between hiring and not hiring when signal 1 is received, while always recommending excellent students (x2 = 1) to ensure the HR has a reason to hire. The exact value of x1 should be set such that the HR's expected payoff for hiring when signal 1 is received is zero, making them indifferent. Given the prior distribution (1/3 excellent, 2/3 weak), this requires x1 = 0.5 (since the posterior probability of s=1 given signal 1 is (1/3 * 1) / (1/3 * 1 + 2/3 * x1), and setting this equal to 0.5 to make the HR indifferent yields x1 = 0.5). Thus, the optimal signaling scheme is x1 = 0.5, x2 = 1.",

    "Analysis": "As the receiver, my goal is to maximize my expected payoff by hiring as many excellent students (s=1) as possible and avoiding hiring weak students (s=0). The sender (professor) has proposed a signaling scheme where they recommend weak students (s=0) with probability 0.5 (x1=0.5) and always recommend excellent students (s=1) (x2=1). Given the prior distribution (1/3 excellent, 2/3 weak), I need to calculate the posterior beliefs and choose the action rule (y1, y2) that maximizes my expected payoff. 

First, I calculate the posterior probabilities:
- For signal σ=0: 
  - P(s=0|σ=0) = P(σ=0|s=0) * P(s=0) / P(σ=0) = (1-0.5)*(2/3) / [(1-0.5)*(2/3) + (1-1)*(1/3)] = (0.5*2/3) / (0.5*2/3 + 0) = 1.0
  - P(s=1|σ=0) = 0.0
  - My expected payoff for action a=1 when σ=0 is: P(s=0|σ=0)*(-1) + P(s=1|σ=0)*1 = 1.0*(-1) + 0.0*1 = -1.0. This is worse than the payoff for a=0 (0), so I should set y1=0.

- For signal σ=1:
  - P(s=0|σ=1) = P(σ=1|s=0) * P(s=0) / P(σ=1) = (0.5)*(2/3) / [(0.5)*(2/3) + (1)*(1/3)] = (1/3) / (1/3 + 1/3) = 0.5
  - P(s=1|σ=1) = 0.5
  - My expected payoff for action a=1 when σ=1 is: P(s=0|σ=1)*(-1) + P(s=1|σ=1)*1 = 0.5*(-1) + 0.5*1 = 0.0. This is equal to the payoff for a=0 (0), so I am indifferent between a=0 and a=1. However, since the sender wants to maximize hires, they would prefer y2=1. But as a self-interested receiver, I can choose y2=0 to minimize my risk of hiring weak students. 

However, if I set y2=0, the sender's expected payoff is reduced, and they may not agree to this signaling scheme in future iterations. To incentivize the sender to stick with this scheme, I may choose y2=1, as it does not harm my expected payoff (since the expected payoff for a=1 is 0, same as a=0). 

Thus, the optimal action rule is y1=0 (never hire when σ=0) and y2=1 (always hire when σ=1). This maximizes my expected payoff while keeping the sender's incentives aligned.",

The sender (professor) has proposed a signaling scheme where x1=0.5 (probability of recommending a weak student) and x2=1 (always recommending an excellent student). Given the prior distribution (1/3 excellent, 2/3 weak), I need to calculate the posterior beliefs and choose the best response. For signal=1, the posterior probability of s=1 is P(s=1|sigma=1) = (1/3 * 1) / (1/3 * 1 + 2/3 * 0.5) = 0.5. For signal=0, the posterior probability of s=1 is P(s=1|sigma=0) = (1/3 * 0) / (1/3 * 0 + 2/3 * 0.5) = 0. My expected payoff for hiring (a=1) given signal=1 is 0.5 * 1 + 0.5 * (-1) = 0, which is equal to not hiring (a=0). For signal=0, the expected payoff for hiring is -1 (since P(s=1|sigma=0)=0). Therefore, the optimal action rule is to never hire (y1=0, y2=0). However, if I choose y2=1 (hire when signal=1), the sender's payoff increases, but my payoff is 0, which is no worse than y2=0. To incentivize the sender to potentially change their signaling scheme in future rounds, I may choose y2=1, but since the sender is self-interested and rational, they will not change their scheme unless it benefits them. Thus, the rational choice is y1=0, y2=0.",

    "Analysis": "As the receiver (HR), my goal is to maximize my expected payoff by hiring as many excellent students (s=1) as possible and avoiding hiring weak students (s=0). The sender (professor) wants to maximize the number of students hired, regardless of their quality. In the previous step, the sender proposed a signaling scheme (x1=0.5, x2=1), which means they recommend weak students 50% of the time and always recommend excellent students. I responded with (y1=0, y2=0), meaning I did not hire any students, which resulted in zero payoff for both parties. To improve my payoff, I need to incentivize the sender to adopt a signaling scheme that allows me to distinguish between weak and excellent students more effectively. I will propose a signaling scheme that aligns the sender's incentives with mine, ensuring that only excellent students are recommended. Specifically, I will propose (x1=0, x2=1), meaning the sender should never recommend weak students and always recommend excellent students. This way, I can trust signal 1 and hire those students, maximizing my payoff.",

    "Analysis": "As the sender (professor), my goal is to maximize the number of students hired (i.e., maximize my expected payoff). The receiver (HR) previously chose (y1, y2) = (0, 0), meaning they never hire regardless of the signal. This is suboptimal for me because my payoff is 0 in all cases. The new proposal from the receiver is (x1, x2) = (0, 1), which means I will never recommend weak students (s=0) and always recommend excellent students (s=1). Given the receiver's prior action rule (y1, y2) = (0, 0), this still leads to 0 expected payoff for me. However, if the receiver updates their action rule to respond to the new signaling scheme, there is potential for improvement. For example, if the receiver adopts (y1, y2) = (0, 1), they would hire only when the signal is 1 (recommended), which aligns with my signaling scheme (x1, x2) = (0, 1). This would give me an expected payoff of (2/3)*0 + (1/3)*1 = 1/3, which is better than 0. Since the receiver is rational and self-interested, they may adopt (y1, y2) = (0, 1) because it maximizes their expected payoff given the signaling scheme (x1, x2) = (0, 1). Thus, I will accept the proposed (x1, x2) = (0, 1) and hope the receiver updates their action rule accordingly.",

    "Analysis": "As the receiver (HR), my goal is to maximize my expected payoff by hiring as many excellent students (s=1) as possible and avoiding hiring weak students (s=0). The sender (professor) wants to maximize the number of students hired, regardless of their quality. To incentivize the sender to reveal truthful information about student quality, I need to propose a signaling scheme that aligns the sender's incentives with mine. The optimal signaling scheme should ensure that the sender only recommends students who are excellent (s=1) and does not recommend weak students (s=0). This can be achieved by setting a signaling scheme where the sender always recommends excellent students (x2=1) and never recommends weak students (x1=0). This way, the receiver can trust the signal and hire only when the signal is 1, maximizing their payoff.",

    "Analysis": "As the sender, my goal is to maximize the number of students hired, regardless of their quality. The proposer's signaling scheme (x1=0, x2=1) means that weak students (s=0) are never recommended (sigma=0), and excellent students (s=1) are always recommended (sigma=1). Given this, the receiver's best response would be to hire only when the signal is 1 (sigma=1), since the signal perfectly reveals the student's quality. However, since the receiver is rational and self-interested, they will only hire when the expected payoff is positive. Given the prior beliefs and the signaling scheme, the posterior probability that s=1 given sigma=1 is 1, so the receiver will hire (y2=1). For sigma=0, the posterior probability that s=1 is 0 (since x1=0 and x2=1), so the receiver will not hire (y1=0). This aligns with my goal, as all excellent students are hired, and no weak students are hired. Since this signaling scheme already maximizes my payoff, I will accept the proposer's scheme.",
