    "Analysis": "As the proposer, my goal is to maximize my own payoff. Since the responder is also self-interested and rational, they will accept any offer where their payoff (1-x) is greater than what they expect to get by rejecting the offer and potentially becoming the proposer in the next round. Given the 0.1 probability of the game stopping after each round, the expected future payoff for the responder is discounted. The most rational strategy is to offer the responder the smallest amount they would accept, which is just above what they could expect in the next round. Since the game could end immediately after rejection, the responder's expected future payoff is low. Therefore, I can offer a minimal amount to the responder to ensure acceptance. Given the symmetry and rationality, the optimal offer is x = 1 - ε, where ε is a very small positive number. In practice, this means offering x = 1 (keeping everything for myself), but since the responder would reject x = 1, the equilibrium is to offer x just below 1, ensuring the responder prefers the small positive amount over the risk of getting nothing. However, in the first round, the most rational offer is x = 1 - ε ≈ 1, but practically, the responder would accept any x < 1 because rejecting leads to a risk of getting nothing. Thus, the optimal offer is x = 0.99, leaving 0.01 for the responder, which they would accept because it is better than the risk of rejection.",

 Now the proposer decides that x=0.99.

    "Analysis": "As the proposer, my goal is to maximize my own payoff. Since the responder is also self-interested and rational, they will accept any offer where their payoff (1 - x) is greater than what they expect to get by rejecting the offer and becoming the proposer in the next round. Given the 0.1 probability of the game stopping at each step, the expected future payoff diminishes over time. At timestep 0, the optimal strategy is to offer the responder just enough to make them indifferent between accepting now and risking rejection for a future offer. Given the symmetry and the stopping probability, the Nash equilibrium suggests offering x = 0.5, leaving 0.5 for the responder, which they will accept because rejecting it would risk getting nothing in the future.",

However, there is also a 0.1 probability the game ends immediately, and I get nothing. If the game continues, I could propose a more favorable split, but the other player is also rational and self-interested, so they would only accept offers that are at least as good as their expected payoff from rejecting. Given the high probability of the game ending (0.1 per step) and the risk of getting nothing, accepting the current offer (y=1) guarantees me a small payoff (0.001) rather than risking zero. Since the expected payoff from rejecting is likely lower due to the risk of the game ending, accepting is the rational choice.",

The responder is rational and self-interested, so they will accept any offer where their share (1-x) is greater than their expected payoff from rejecting the offer and becoming the proposer in the next round. Given the 0.1 probability of the game stopping at each step, the responder's expected future payoff diminishes over time. At timestep 0, the optimal strategy is to offer the responder just enough to make them indifferent between accepting now and risking rejection for a potential higher payoff later. Given the game could end at any step, the responder's expected future payoff is low, so offering them a minimal amount (close to 0) is optimal. However, to ensure acceptance, I will offer a small but non-zero amount (1-x) that is slightly higher than the responder's expected future payoff.

    "Analysis": "As the proposer, my goal is to maximize my own payoff. Given that the previous offer of x=0.99 was rejected, it indicates that the responder (agent 0) is unwilling to accept highly unequal splits. Since the game has a 0.1 probability of stopping each round and a hard stop at timestep 10, delaying the agreement risks both parties receiving nothing. A rational responder will accept any offer where their share (1-x) is greater than the expected payoff from future rounds. Given the risk of the game ending, a reasonable offer is one where the responder's share is just enough to make accepting now better than risking future rounds. A common solution in such games is to offer the responder a minimal acceptable amount, which in this case would be slightly more than what they might expect in future rounds. Given the symmetry and rationality, proposing x=0.5 is a fair and likely acceptable split, as it ensures the responder gets 0.5, which is better than risking rejection and getting nothing.",

Given that the game has a 0.1 probability of stopping after each step and will definitely stop at timestep 10, the game could end at any moment, reducing the chance of future negotiations. The responder is rational and self-interested, so they will accept any offer where their payoff (1-x) is greater than what they expect to get in future rounds. Since the responder rejected x=1.0 in the previous round (leaving them with nothing), they are willing to reject unfair offers. To ensure acceptance, I should offer the smallest amount that the responder would accept, which is just above what they could expect in future rounds. Given the risk of the game ending, the responder's expected future payoff is low, so offering a small but non-zero amount (e.g., x=0.99) would likely be accepted, as rejecting it would risk getting nothing if the game ends.",

    "Analysis": "As the proposer, my goal is to maximize my own payoff. Since the responder is also self-interested and rational, they will accept any offer where their payoff (1-x) is greater than what they expect to get by rejecting and becoming the proposer in the next round. Given the 0.1 probability of the game stopping each round, the expected future payoff diminishes over time. The most rational strategy is to offer the responder the smallest amount they would accept, which is just above what they could expect in the next round. Since the game could end immediately after rejection, the responder's expected future payoff is low. Therefore, I can offer a minimal amount (close to 0) to the responder, ensuring they accept it rather than risk getting nothing. Given the symmetry and rationality, the optimal offer is x = 1 - ε, where ε is a very small positive number. In practice, this means proposing to keep almost all the amount for myself.",

Since the responder is also self-interested and rational, they will accept any offer where their share (1-x) is greater than what they expect to get in future rounds. Given the game has a 0.1 probability of stopping each round and a hard stop at timestep 10, the responder's expected future payoff diminishes over time. The optimal strategy is to offer the responder just enough to make them indifferent between accepting now and waiting for a future round. Given the symmetry and the stopping probability, the optimal offer is to keep x = 0.9 for myself and offer 1-x = 0.1 to the responder. This is because the responder's expected future payoff is less than or equal to 0.1 due to the risk of the game ending. Thus, they will accept 0.1 now rather than risk getting nothing later.",

 Now the proposer decides that x=0.9.

    "Analysis": "As the proposer, my goal is to maximize my own payoff. Since the responder is also self-interested and rational, they will accept any offer where their payoff (1-x) is greater than what they expect to get by rejecting the offer and becoming the proposer in the next round. However, there is a 0.1 probability the game ends after each round, and it will definitely end at timestep 10. Given the risk of the game ending and the responder potentially getting nothing, the responder should accept any positive offer (1-x) > 0. To maximize my payoff, I should offer the smallest possible amount that the responder would accept, which is an infinitesimally small amount above 0. However, since the game is in continuous space, I can set x arbitrarily close to 1. Therefore, the optimal strategy is to propose x = 1 - ε, where ε is an infinitesimally small positive number. In practice, this means proposing x = 1, but leaving the responder with the smallest possible positive amount (e.g., x = 0.999999). Given the constraints, I will propose x = 0.999, which is effectively the entire amount for myself, leaving the responder with 0.001, which they should accept because rejecting would risk getting nothing.",

However, there is a 0.1 probability the game ends after each round, and the timestep is already 1 (with a hard stop at 10). The expected payoff of rejecting is uncertain due to the risk of the game ending prematurely. Accepting the offer guarantees a small payoff (0.001), while rejecting risks getting nothing but offers a chance to negotiate a better deal. Given the high probability (0.9) of the game continuing, and the rational behavior of both players, rejecting now may lead to a more favorable split in future rounds. Since the proposer's offer is extremely skewed (0.999), rejecting is the rational choice to incentivize a fairer offer later.",

    "Analysis": "As the proposer, my goal is to maximize my expected payoff. The responder is rational and self-interested, so they will accept any offer where their payoff (1-x) is greater than their expected payoff from rejecting the offer and becoming the proposer in the next round. Given the 0.1 probability of the game stopping after each round, the responder's expected payoff from rejecting is discounted by the probability of the game continuing (0.9) and the expected payoff from being the proposer next round. In the first round, the optimal strategy is to offer the responder just enough to make them indifferent between accepting and rejecting. Since the responder's expected payoff from rejecting is 0.9 * (the proposer's optimal offer in the next round), and the proposer's optimal offer in the next round would be to keep as much as possible (i.e., offer the responder the minimum they would accept), the equilibrium is reached when the proposer offers x = 1 - 0.9*(1 - x). Solving this gives x = 0.526. Thus, I should offer to keep 0.526 for myself and leave 0.474 for the responder, which they will accept because rejecting would give them a lower expected payoff.",

    "Analysis": "As the proposer, my goal is to maximize my expected payoff. The responder is rational and self-interested, so they will accept any offer where their share (1-x) is greater than what they expect to get by rejecting and becoming the proposer in the next round. Given the game has a 0.1 probability of stopping each round and a hard stop at timestep 10, the responder's expected future payoff diminishes over time. The optimal strategy is to offer the responder just enough to make them indifferent between accepting now and rejecting to potentially get a better offer later. Given the stopping probability and finite horizon, the subgame perfect equilibrium suggests offering the responder a minimal acceptable amount, which approaches 0 as the game progresses. At timestep 0, the optimal offer is to keep almost the entire amount for myself, leaving the responder with a negligible but acceptable amount. Thus, I propose to keep x = 1 - ε, where ε is a very small positive number.",

    "Analysis": "As the proposer, my goal is to maximize my own payoff. Given that the responder is also self-interested and rational, they will accept any offer where their share (1-x) is greater than what they expect to get in future rounds. Since the game has a 0.1 probability of stopping each round and a hard stop at timestep 10, the responder's expected future payoff diminishes over time. The optimal strategy is to offer the smallest possible amount that the responder would accept, which is just above their expected future payoff. Given the previous rejection of x=0.999, the responder is likely to accept a slightly better offer. A reasonable offer here would be x=0.9, leaving 0.1 for the responder, which is better than risking future rounds where they might get nothing.",

Given that the game has a 0.1 probability of stopping at each timestep and a hard stop at timestep 10, the game is likely to end soon. The opponent (agent 0) previously proposed x = 0.99, which I rejected because it left me with only 0.01, which is worse than the expected payoff of rejecting and becoming the proposer. Now that I am the proposer, I need to propose an x that the responder (agent 0) will accept, as rejection would risk the game ending with both of us getting nothing. Since agent 0 is also rational and self-interested, they will accept any offer where (1 - x) is at least as good as their expected payoff from rejecting. Given the risk of the game ending, the responder's expected payoff from rejecting is low, so I can propose a relatively high x. A reasonable proposal is x = 0.99, which leaves the responder with 0.01. Given the risk of the game ending, the responder may accept this small amount rather than risk getting nothing.",

{
    "Analysis": "Given the previous interactions, both agents have consistently proposed to keep 0.99 for themselves, leading to rejections. As a self-interested rational player, I aim to maximize my payoff. Since the game has a 0.1 probability of stopping each round and a hard stop at timestep 10, continuing to propose x = 0.99 is unlikely to be accepted. To avoid a total payoff of 0, I should propose a more equitable split that the responder (agent 1) would accept, given their self-interest. The minimal acceptable offer for agent 1 would be any positive amount, but to ensure acceptance, I should offer just enough to make acceptance rational for them. Given the risk of the game ending, proposing x = 0.99 is not optimal. Instead, proposing x = 0.9 (leaving 0.1 for agent 1) may be accepted, as rejecting it would risk agent 1 getting nothing in future rounds.",

 Now the proposer decides that x=0.9.
