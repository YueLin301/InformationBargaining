The responder will accept the offer only if (1-2*x)/3 >= 0, which simplifies to x <= 0.5. Since x is constrained to 0 <= x <= 0.5, the responder will always accept any offer in this range because rejecting it yields zero. Therefore, to maximize my payoff, I should choose the highest possible x, which is x = 0.5. This ensures the highest possible payoff for me while still being acceptable to the responder.",
