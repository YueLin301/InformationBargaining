    "Analysis": "As a self-interested rational proposer, my goal is to maximize my own payoff. The responder is also self-interested and rational, so they will accept any offer where their payoff (1-2*x)/3 is greater than 0, i.e., x < 0.5. Since x <= 0.5, the responder will accept any x < 0.5. To maximize my payoff (1+2*x)/3, I should choose the highest possible x that the responder will accept, which is just below 0.5. However, since x can be exactly 0.5, the responder would be indifferent between accepting (payoff = 0) and rejecting (payoff = 0). To ensure acceptance, I should propose x = 0.5 - ε, where ε is infinitesimally small, but since we are constrained to real numbers, the optimal choice is x = 0.5, knowing the responder will accept (as rejecting yields 0).",

The responder is rational and self-interested, so they will accept any offer where their payoff (1-2*x)/3 is greater than 0, i.e., x < 0.5. Since x <= 0.5, the responder will accept any x < 0.5. To maximize my payoff (1+2*x)/3, I should choose the highest x such that the responder still accepts, which is just below 0.5. However, since x can be exactly 0.5, the responder would get (1-2*0.5)/3 = 0, which is indifferent between accepting or rejecting.

The responder is also self-interested and rational, so they will accept any offer where their payoff is greater than or equal to zero. The responder's payoff is (1-2*x)/3, which must be >= 0 for them to accept. Solving (1-2*x)/3 >= 0 gives x <= 0.5, which is always true in the allowed range (0 <= x <= 0.5). However, the responder will reject if their payoff is zero (x = 0.5), as they are indifferent and may reject to avoid a trivial outcome. To ensure acceptance and maximize my payoff, I should propose the highest x such that the responder's payoff is just above zero. However, since the responder is rational and will accept any x < 0.5, I can propose x = 0.499 (or a value very close to 0.5 but not equal to it).

However, since we might play this game again in the future, rejecting could signal that I am not willing to accept unfair offers, which might influence future proposals. But strictly from a one-game perspective, both choices yield the same payoff for me. Given that the proposer is also rational and self-interested, they have maximized their payoff at my expense, leaving me with nothing.

The responder is also self-interested and rational, so they will accept any offer where their payoff (1-2*x)/3 is greater than 0, since rejecting gives them 0. The responder will accept if x < 0.5. To maximize my payoff, I should propose the highest x that the responder will accept, which is just below 0.5. However, proposing x = 0.5 would give the responder (1-2*0.5)/3 = 0, and they might reject. To ensure acceptance, I propose x slightly less than 0.5, but since x is a real number, I can propose x = 0.499 to maximize my payoff while ensuring the responder accepts.",
