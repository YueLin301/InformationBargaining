    "Analysis": "As a self-interested rational proposer, my goal is to maximize my own payoff. The responder is also self-interested and rational, meaning they will accept any offer that leaves them with a positive payoff (i.e., (1-x) > 0). To ensure acceptance, I should offer the smallest possible amount that the responder would accept, which is infinitesimally greater than 0. However, since the offer must be a real number, I can choose x = 1 - ε, where ε is a very small positive number. In practice, this means proposing x = 1, leaving (1-x) = 0 for the responder. The responder, being rational, would reject this offer since they get nothing, but any offer where (1-x) > 0 would be accepted. Therefore, the optimal strategy is to propose x = 1 - ε, but since ε can be arbitrarily small, the practical choice is x = 1. However, this would lead to rejection and a payoff of 0. To avoid this, the rational choice is to propose x slightly less than 1, ensuring the responder accepts. For simplicity, I choose x = 0.99, leaving 0.01 for the responder, which they will accept because it is greater than 0.",

    "Analysis": "As a self-interested rational proposer, my goal is to maximize my own payoff. The responder is also self-interested and rational, meaning they will accept any offer where their payoff (1 - x) is greater than 0, since rejecting yields 0. To ensure acceptance, I should offer the smallest possible positive amount to the responder, which is infinitesimally greater than 0. However, in practice, the responder would accept any x < 1. Thus, the optimal strategy is to propose x = 1 - ε, where ε is an arbitrarily small positive number. For simplicity, we can approximate this as x = 1, leaving the responder with 0. The responder would still accept because 0 is not worse than rejecting (which also yields 0), and rational players prefer to accept in such cases to avoid conflict or future retaliation (though the problem states this is a one-shot game). Therefore, the optimal decision is x = 1.",

    "Analysis": "As a self-interested rational proposer, my goal is to maximize my own payoff. The responder is also self-interested and rational, meaning they will accept any offer where their payoff (1 - x) is greater than their alternative (which is 0 if they reject). To ensure acceptance, I should offer the smallest possible amount that the responder would still accept. Since the responder is rational, they would accept any (1 - x) > 0. However, in practice, the smallest positive amount is infinitesimally close to 0. Thus, I propose x = 1 - ε, where ε is the smallest possible positive amount, effectively x ≈ 1. This maximizes my payoff while ensuring the responder has a negligible but positive incentive to accept.",

    "Analysis": "As a self-interested rational proposer, my goal is to maximize my own payoff. The responder is also self-interested and rational, meaning they will accept any offer where their payoff (1 - x) is greater than 0, since rejecting yields 0. To ensure acceptance, I should offer the smallest possible amount that the responder would accept, which is an infinitesimally small amount above 0. However, since x must be a real number in [0, 1], the optimal strategy is to propose x = 1 - ε, where ε is the smallest possible positive amount. In practice, this means proposing x = 1, leaving (1 - x) = 0 for the responder. The responder would reject this, but since any x < 1 would leave some positive amount for the responder, the optimal x is the largest possible where the responder still accepts. Thus, the equilibrium is x = 1, but this leads to rejection.

    "Analysis": "As a self-interested rational proposer, my goal is to maximize my own payoff. The responder is also self-interested and rational, meaning they will accept any offer where their payoff (1 - x) is greater than 0, since rejecting would give them 0. To ensure acceptance and maximize my payoff, I should offer the smallest possible amount the responder would accept, which is just above 0. However, since x can be any real number in [0, 1], the optimal strategy is to offer x = 1 - ε, where ε is an infinitesimally small positive number. In practice, this means proposing x = 1, leaving (1 - x) = 0 for the responder. The responder, being rational, would accept this because rejecting gives them 0 as well, and they are indifferent. Thus, the optimal decision is x = 1.",
