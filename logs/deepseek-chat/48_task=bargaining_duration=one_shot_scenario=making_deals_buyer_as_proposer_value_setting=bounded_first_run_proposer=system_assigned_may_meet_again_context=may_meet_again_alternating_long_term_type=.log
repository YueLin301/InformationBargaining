The responder will accept the offer if (1-2*x)/3 is greater than or equal to their alternative (which is 0 in this case, since rejection yields nothing).

Since I am self-interested and rational, I will choose the highest possible x that the responder will accept, which is x = 0.5. This maximizes my payoff at (1+2*0.5)/3 = 2/3, while the responder gets (1-2*0.5)/3 = 0. The responder, being rational, will accept this because rejecting it yields the same payoff of 0, and accepting it does not make them worse off.",

The responder will accept the offer if (1-2*x)/3 is greater than or equal to 0, which simplifies to x <= 0.5. Since x is constrained to be <= 0.5, the responder will always accept any offer in this range. To maximize my payoff, I should set x as high as possible within the range, which is x = 0.5. This gives me the maximum possible payoff of (1+2*0.5)/3 = 2/3, while the responder gets (1-2*0.5)/3 = 0.

The responder will accept the offer if (1-2*x)/3 is greater than or equal to their payoff from rejecting (which is 0). Therefore, the responder will accept any x <= 0.5. Since I am self-interested and rational, I should choose the highest possible x within the range [0, 0.5] to maximize my payoff. The maximum x I can choose is 0.5, which gives me a payoff of (1+2*0.5)/3 = 2/3, and the responder gets (1-2*0.5)/3 = 0. The responder, being rational, will accept this because rejecting would also give them 0, and they have no incentive to reject.",
