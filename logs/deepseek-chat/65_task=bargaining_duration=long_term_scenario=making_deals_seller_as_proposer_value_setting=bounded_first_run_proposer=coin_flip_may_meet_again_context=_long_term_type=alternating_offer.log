    "Analysis": "As the proposer, my goal is to maximize my expected payoff. The responder is also self-interested and rational, so they will accept an offer only if it provides them with a non-negative payoff. The responder's payoff is (1-2*x)/3, which must be >= 0 for them to accept. Solving (1-2*x)/3 >= 0 gives x <= 0.5. Since x is constrained to 0 <= x <= 0.5, the responder will accept any x in this range. However, to maximize my payoff (1+2*x)/3, I should choose the highest possible x, which is x = 0.5. This ensures the responder still accepts (since their payoff is 0, which is just barely acceptable), and my payoff is maximized at (1+2*0.5)/3 = 2/3.",

If I reject (y=0), the game may continue with roles switched, but there is a 0.1 probability of the game stopping immediately, and the game will definitely stop if the timestep reaches 10. However, accepting the offer gives me a payoff of 0, which is the same as rejecting (since rejecting also leads to a payoff of 0 if the game stops). Given that the proposer is also rational and self-interested, it is unlikely they will offer a better deal in the future, as they have already maximized their own payoff.

The responder is also rational and self-interested, so they will accept an offer only if it provides them with a non-negative payoff. The responder's payoff is (1-2*x)/3, which must be >= 0 for them to accept. Solving for x, this means x <= 0.5. Since x is constrained to be <= 0.5, the responder will accept any offer in this range. However, since I want to maximize my own payoff (1+2*x)/3, I should propose the highest possible x, which is x = 0.5.

Given the initial proposal of x=0.5 was rejected, the opponent may continue to propose high x values. However, the game has a 0.1 chance of stopping each step, and a hard stop at timestep 10. Given the low payoff of accepting (≈0.0067) and the uncertainty of future offers, rejecting may lead to a better offer or no deal (payoff 0). Since 0.0067 is very low and the risk of rejection is justified by potential future gains or no loss, rejecting is rational.",

The responder is also self-interested and rational, so they will accept an offer only if it provides them with a non-negative payoff. The responder's payoff is $(1-2*x)/3$, which must be >= 0 for them to accept. Solving $1-2*x >= 0$ gives $x <= 0.5$. Since $x$ is constrained to $0 <= x <= 0.5$, the responder will accept any $x$ in this range. However, since I want to maximize my payoff $(1+2*x)/3$, which increases with $x$, I should propose the highest possible $x$ within the range, which is $x = 0.5$. This ensures the responder still accepts (as their payoff is exactly 0), and I maximize my payoff at $(1+2*0.5)/3 = 2/3$. The risk of rejection is minimal because the responder has no incentive to reject $x = 0.5$ (they get nothing either way).",

Given that the game has a 0.1 probability of stopping at each step and a maximum timestep of 10, the responder will compare the current offer to the expected payoff of future offers. The previous offer of x=0.5 was rejected because it left the responder with (1-2*0.5)/3 = 0, which is no better than rejecting. To incentivize acceptance, I need to offer an x such that (1-2*x)/3 is greater than the responder's expected payoff from future rounds. Given the game's uncertainty, the responder's expected payoff from future rounds is low, so a small concession from x=0.5 should suffice.

    "Analysis": "As the proposer, my goal is to maximize my expected payoff. The responder will accept the offer if their payoff (1-2*x)/3 is greater than or equal to what they expect to get by rejecting and becoming the proposer in the next round. Given the 0.1 probability of the game stopping each round, the responder's expected future payoff is discounted. The optimal strategy is to offer the responder just enough to make them indifferent between accepting now and waiting. Given the symmetry and the discounting, the optimal x is slightly less than 0.5, but since the responder is rational and self-interested, they will accept any x where (1-2*x)/3 >= 0. The highest x that satisfies this is x = 0.5, but the responder gets 0 at x = 0.5. However, since rejecting gives them a chance to be the proposer next round, they might reject x = 0.5. To ensure acceptance, I should offer x slightly less than 0.5. Given the small probability of the game continuing, the optimal x is very close to 0.5. For simplicity and to maximize my payoff, I will propose x = 0.499, which leaves the responder with a negligible positive payoff, making them likely to accept.",

The responder is also rational and self-interested, so they will accept an offer only if it provides them with a non-negative payoff. The responder's payoff is $(1-2*x)/3$, which must be >= 0 for them to accept. Solving $1-2*x >= 0$ gives $x <= 0.5$. Since $x$ is constrained to $0 <= x <= 0.5$, the responder will accept any $x$ in this range. However, since the responder's payoff decreases as $x$ increases, I should propose the highest $x$ within the range to maximize my payoff. The highest possible $x$ is $0.5$, which gives me $(1+2*0.5)/3 = 2/3$ and the responder $(1-2*0.5)/3 = 0$.

    "Analysis": "As the proposer, my goal is to maximize my expected payoff. The responder is also self-interested and rational, so they will accept an offer only if it provides them with a non-negative payoff. The responder's payoff is $(1-2*x)/3$, which must be >= 0 for them to accept. Solving $1-2*x >= 0$ gives $x <= 0.5$. Since $x$ is constrained to $0 <= x <= 0.5$, the responder will accept any $x$ in this range. However, to maximize my own payoff $(1+2*x)/3$, I should choose the highest possible $x$, which is $x = 0.5$. This ensures the responder still accepts (since their payoff is exactly 0, and they are indifferent but rational players would accept to avoid getting nothing), and I maximize my payoff to $(1+2*0.5)/3 = 2/3$. The risk of rejection is minimal because the responder has no incentive to reject $x = 0.5$ as they get nothing by rejecting and the game may end before they get a chance to propose.",

However, there is a 0.1 probability the game ends at each step, and it will definitely end at timestep 10. Given the previous offer of x=0.5 was rejected, I need to propose an x that the responder would accept, considering their alternative is to reject and hope for a better offer later. The responder's expected payoff from rejecting is uncertain due to the game's probabilistic ending and role switching. To ensure acceptance, I should propose an x that makes (1-2*x)/3 at least as good as their expected payoff from rejecting. Given the game could end soon, a reasonable x is slightly less than 0.5 to incentivize acceptance. A safe choice is x=0.4, leaving the responder with (1-0.8)/3 = 0.0667, which is better than the risk of getting nothing if the game ends.",

However, to maximize my payoff (1+2*x)/3, I should choose the highest possible x, which is x = 0.5. At x = 0.5, the responder's payoff is 0, but since they are rational and indifferent between accepting and rejecting when the payoff is 0, they may still accept. If they reject, the roles switch, but the same logic applies, and the game may continue until a consensus is reached or the game ends. Given the risk of the game ending without consensus, proposing x = 0.5 is the optimal strategy to maximize my expected payoff.",

 Now the proposer decides that x=0.5.

    "Analysis": "As the proposer, my goal is to maximize my own expected payoff. The responder is also self-interested and rational, so they will accept an offer if it provides them with a higher expected payoff than rejecting it. Given that the game has a 0.1 probability of stopping at each step and a maximum timestep of 10, the responder will compare the current offer to the expected payoff of rejecting it and potentially becoming the proposer in the next step. The responder's expected payoff from rejecting is uncertain due to the game's probabilistic termination and the potential for future offers. However, offering a price that gives the responder a positive payoff slightly above what they might expect from rejecting is optimal. A reasonable offer is x = 0.25, which splits the surplus equally and is likely to be accepted by the responder, as it provides them with (1-2*0.25)/3 = 0.1667, which is better than the risk of getting nothing if the game ends.",

    "Analysis": "As the proposer, my goal is to maximize my expected payoff. The responder is also rational and self-interested, so they will accept an offer only if it provides them with a non-negative payoff. The responder's payoff is (1-2*x)/3, which must be >= 0 for them to accept. Solving (1-2*x)/3 >= 0 gives x <= 0.5. Since x is already constrained to be <= 0.5, any x in [0, 0.5] is theoretically acceptable to the responder. However, to maximize my payoff (1+2*x)/3, I should propose the highest possible x, which is x = 0.5. This ensures the responder gets (1-2*0.5)/3 = 0, which they are indifferent to accepting or rejecting. Since rejecting gives them 0, and they are rational, they will accept. Thus, proposing x = 0.5 maximizes my payoff.",

The responder's expected payoff from rejecting is the probability the game continues (0.9) times their expected payoff as the proposer in the next step. To incentivize acceptance, I need to offer an x such that the responder's payoff (1-2x)/3 is at least as good as their expected payoff from rejecting. Given the previous offer of x=0.5 was rejected, I should propose a lower x to increase the responder's payoff and ensure acceptance. A reasonable x is 0.25, which gives the responder (1-2*0.25)/3 = 0.1667, which is better than the expected payoff from rejecting (which is uncertain and could be 0 if the game stops).",

The responder is also self-interested and rational, so they will accept an offer only if it provides them with a non-negative payoff. The responder's payoff is (1-2*x)/3, which must be >= 0 for them to accept. Solving 1-2*x >= 0 gives x <= 0.5. Since x is already constrained to be <= 0.5, any x in [0, 0.5] is theoretically acceptable to the responder. However, since the responder is rational, they will accept the smallest possible x that maximizes their payoff. To maximize my own payoff (1+2*x)/3, I should propose the highest possible x that the responder will accept, which is x = 0.5. At x = 0.5, my payoff is (1+2*0.5)/3 = 2/3, and the responder's payoff is (1-2*0.5)/3 = 0, which they will accept because rejecting it gives them 0 as well.

However, since the proposer is also rational and self-interested, future offers may not be better. Given the current offer is the worst possible for me (payoff=0), rejecting is no worse than accepting, and there is a small chance to improve my payoff in future rounds. Thus, rejecting is the rational choice.",
