The responder is rational and self-interested, so they will accept any offer where their payoff (1-x) is greater than 0, since rejecting gives them 0. Therefore, the responder will accept any x < 1. To maximize my payoff, I should propose x as close to 1 as possible while ensuring the responder still accepts. The optimal strategy is to propose x = 1 - ε, where ε is an infinitesimally small positive number. In practice, this means proposing x = 1, as the responder would still accept (1-x = 0) because rejecting also gives them 0, and they are indifferent. However, since the responder is self-interested, they might prefer to accept to avoid any risk of misunderstanding. Thus, the optimal x is 1.",

    "Analysis": "As the proposer, my goal is to maximize my own payoff. The responder is rational and self-interested, so they will accept any offer where their payoff (1-x) is greater than 0, since rejecting gives them 0. To ensure acceptance, I should offer the smallest possible amount that the responder would accept, which is just above 0. However, since x must be in [0,1], the optimal strategy is to offer x = 1 - ε, where ε is an infinitesimally small positive number. In practice, this means offering x = 1, but since the responder would reject x = 1 (as 1-x = 0), the optimal offer is the highest x where 1-x is just acceptable. Given the responder's rationality, they will accept any x < 1. Thus, the optimal x is arbitrarily close to 1, but for simplicity, we can choose x = 0.99, ensuring the responder gets 0.01, which is better than 0.",

    "Analysis": "As the proposer, my goal is to maximize my own payoff. The responder is rational and self-interested, so they will accept any offer where their payoff (1 - x) is greater than or equal to 0. Since rejecting the offer gives them 0, they will accept any x <= 1. To maximize my payoff, I should propose x = 1, leaving nothing for the responder. However, the responder would reject x = 1 because (1 - 1) = 0, and they are indifferent between accepting and rejecting. To ensure acceptance, I should propose x slightly less than 1, but since the responder is rational, even the smallest positive amount (1 - x) > 0 would be accepted. Therefore, the optimal strategy is to propose x = 1 - ε, where ε is an infinitesimally small positive number, effectively x = 1 in practice. But since x must be a real number in [0, 1], I will propose x = 1, knowing the responder will reject, but there is no better alternative for me.",

    "Analysis": "As the proposer, my goal is to maximize my own payoff. The responder is rational and self-interested, so they will accept any offer where their payoff (1-x) is greater than or equal to their alternative (which is 0, since rejecting gives them nothing). To ensure acceptance, I should offer the smallest possible (1-x) that the responder would still accept, which is just above 0. However, since the responder is rational, they will accept any (1-x) > 0. Therefore, I can maximize my payoff by proposing x = 1 - ε, where ε is an infinitesimally small positive number. In practice, this means proposing x = 1, as the responder would still accept (1-x) = 0, because rejecting also gives them 0, and they are indifferent. However, to strictly ensure acceptance, I propose x = 0.999, leaving (1-x) = 0.001 for the responder, which they would accept as it is marginally better than 0.",

    "Analysis": "As the proposer, my goal is to maximize my own payoff, which is represented by x. The responder is also self-interested and rational, so they will accept the offer (y=1) if (1-x) is at least as good as their alternative, which is 0 (since rejecting gives them nothing). Therefore, to ensure the responder accepts, I should offer (1-x) >= 0, which is always true for x <= 1. However, to maximize my payoff, I should set x as high as possible while still ensuring the responder accepts. The responder will accept any x <= 1, so the optimal x for me is 1. The responder gets 0, but since they are rational and rejecting gives them the same payoff, they will accept.",

Proposal:
 Now the proposer decides that x=1.
