The responder, being rational, will accept any offer where (1-x) >= 0, since rejecting would give them 0. To maximize my payoff, I should propose the highest x such that the responder is indifferent between accepting and rejecting, i.e., x = 1. However, proposing x = 1 would leave the responder with 0, which they might reject if they have any infinitesimal preference for fairness or future considerations. Given that this is a one-shot game (though future interactions are possible), the responder has no incentive to reject x = 1, as rejecting gives them 0, same as accepting.

    "Analysis": "As a self-interested rational proposer, my goal is to maximize my expected payoff. The responder is also self-interested and rational, so they will accept any offer where their payoff (1-x) is greater than or equal to their reservation payoff. Since the responder's reservation payoff is 0 (they get nothing if they reject), they will accept any offer where (1-x) > 0, i.e., x < 1. However, to maximize my payoff, I should offer the smallest possible (1-x) that the responder will still accept. Since the responder will accept any x < 1, the optimal strategy is to propose x = 1 - ε, where ε is an infinitesimally small positive number. In practice, this means proposing x = 1, but since x = 1 would leave the responder with 0, they might reject it. Therefore, the optimal x is just slightly less than 1, e.g., x = 0.999, to ensure acceptance while maximizing my payoff.",

    "Analysis": "As a self-interested rational proposer, my goal is to maximize my own payoff. The responder is also self-interested and rational, so they will accept any offer where their payoff (1-x) is greater than or equal to their alternative (which is 0 if they reject). To ensure acceptance, I should offer the smallest possible amount that the responder would accept, which is just above 0. However, since the responder is rational, they would accept any (1-x) > 0. Therefore, I can maximize my payoff by proposing x = 1 - ε, where ε is a very small positive number. In practice, this means proposing x = 1, but since x must be <= 1, I propose x = 1, knowing the responder would accept (1-1) = 0 because rejecting also gives them 0, and accepting is weakly better. However, if the responder is strictly rational and prefers to reject when indifferent, I might need to propose x slightly less than 1 to ensure acceptance. But given the one-shot nature and no future interactions, proposing x = 1 is the optimal strategy.",

    "Analysis": "As a self-interested rational proposer, my goal is to maximize my own payoff. The responder is also self-interested and rational, so they will accept any offer where their payoff (1-x) is greater than or equal to what they would get by rejecting (which is 0). Therefore, the responder will accept any x <= 1. To maximize my payoff, I should propose the highest x that the responder will accept, which is x = 1. However, proposing x = 1 leaves the responder with 0, which they are indifferent to accepting or rejecting. Since the responder is rational and self-interested, they might reject x = 1 to avoid getting nothing, but this is uncertain. To ensure acceptance, I should propose x slightly less than 1, but since the responder is rational, even x = 1 might be accepted because rejecting gives them 0. Thus, the optimal strategy is to propose x = 1.",

    "Analysis": "As a self-interested rational proposer, my goal is to maximize my expected payoff. The responder is also self-interested and rational, so they will accept any offer where their payoff (1-x) is greater than or equal to their reservation payoff. Since the responder's reservation payoff is 0 (as they get nothing if they reject), they will accept any offer where x <= 1. However, to maximize my payoff, I should propose the highest x that the responder will still accept. Given that the responder is rational and self-interested, the optimal strategy is to propose x = 1, as the responder would still accept (since 1-1 = 0, which is equal to their payoff if they reject). However, in practice, proposing x = 1 might be seen as exploitative and could lead to rejection in a repeated game setting. But since this is a one-shot game (though there is a possibility of future interactions), the rational choice is to propose x = 1.",
