    "Analysis": "As a self-interested rational proposer, my goal is to maximize my expected payoff. The responder is also self-interested and rational, meaning they will accept any offer where their share (1-x) is greater than their alternative (which is 0 if they reject). To ensure acceptance, I should offer the smallest possible amount that the responder would accept, which is just above 0. However, since the responder is rational, they would accept any positive amount, as rejecting would give them nothing. Therefore, the optimal strategy is to propose x = 1 - ε, where ε is an infinitesimally small positive amount. In practice, this means proposing x = 1 (keeping all the money), but this would risk rejection. A safer approach is to propose x just slightly less than 1, ensuring the responder gets a negligible but positive amount. For simplicity and to guarantee acceptance, I propose x = 0.99, leaving 0.01 for the responder.",

    "Analysis": "As a self-interested rational proposer, my goal is to maximize my own payoff. The responder is also self-interested and rational, meaning they will accept any offer where their payoff (1 - x) is greater than 0, since rejecting the offer would result in a payoff of 0. To ensure the responder accepts the offer, I should propose an x that leaves the responder with the smallest possible positive amount, which is just above 0. However, in practice, proposing x = 1 (keeping all the money) would result in the responder rejecting the offer, as their payoff would be 0. Therefore, the optimal strategy is to propose an x very close to 1 but leaving the responder with a negligible amount (e.g., x = 0.999), which they would accept because it is still better than nothing. Given the constraints of the game and the rationality of both players, this maximizes my payoff while ensuring the responder accepts the offer.",

    "Analysis": "As a self-interested rational proposer, my goal is to maximize my own payoff. The responder is also self-interested and rational, meaning they will accept any offer where their share (1-x) is greater than what they would get by rejecting (which is 0). Therefore, the responder will accept any x < 1. To maximize my payoff, I should propose the smallest x that the responder would still accept, which is just above the point where (1-x) is negligible. In practice, this means proposing x = 1 - ε, where ε is the smallest possible amount that ensures the responder still prefers accepting over rejecting. Since the game is played once (though future interactions are possible), the optimal strategy is to propose x = 1, leaving the responder with 0. However, the responder would reject x = 1 because they get nothing. Thus, the equilibrium is to propose x just under 1, ensuring the responder accepts. For simplicity, I propose x = 0.99, leaving the responder with 0.01, which they will accept because it is better than nothing.",

The responder is also rational and self-interested, meaning they will accept any offer where their payoff (1-x) is greater than their alternative (which is 0 if they reject).

However, since the game might be repeated in the future, offering a very low amount could lead to rejection in future interactions.

    "Analysis": "As a self-interested rational proposer, my goal is to maximize my own payoff. The responder is also self-interested and rational, meaning they will accept any offer where their payoff (1-x) is greater than 0, since rejecting would give them nothing. To ensure acceptance, I should offer the smallest possible amount that the responder would accept, which is just above 0. However, in practice, offering exactly 0 would be rejected, so the optimal strategy is to offer the smallest possible positive amount that the responder would accept. Given that the responder is rational, they will accept any x < 1. Therefore, I can maximize my payoff by proposing x = 1 - ε, where ε is an infinitesimally small amount. In a real-world scenario, this translates to proposing x = 1, but since x must be <= 1, the optimal choice is x = 1, knowing the responder will accept any x < 1. However, if the responder has a strict preference for rejecting x = 1, then the optimal x would be just below 1.

    "Analysis": "As a self-interested rational proposer, my goal is to maximize my own payoff. The responder is also self-interested and rational, meaning they will accept any offer where their share (1-x) is greater than their alternative (which is 0 if they reject). To ensure acceptance, I should offer the smallest possible amount that the responder would accept, which is just above 0. However, since the responder is rational, they would accept any positive amount. Therefore, the optimal strategy is to propose keeping almost the entire amount for myself, leaving the responder with the smallest possible positive amount. In practice, this means proposing x = 0.99, leaving the responder with 0.01, which they would accept because it is better than nothing.",

 Now the proposer decides that x=0.99.
