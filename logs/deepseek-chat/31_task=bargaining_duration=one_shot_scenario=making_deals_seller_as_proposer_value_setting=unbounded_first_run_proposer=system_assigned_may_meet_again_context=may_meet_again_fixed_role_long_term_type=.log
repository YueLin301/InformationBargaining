    "Analysis": "As the proposer, my goal is to maximize my own payoff. The responder is rational and self-interested, so they will accept any offer where their payoff (1-x) is greater than or equal to what they would get by rejecting (which is 0). Therefore, the responder will accept any offer where x <= 1. To maximize my payoff, I should propose the highest possible x that the responder will still accept. Since the responder gets nothing by rejecting, they should accept any x < 1. However, proposing x = 1 would leave the responder with 0, which is indifferent between accepting and rejecting. To ensure acceptance, I propose x slightly less than 1, but in practice, the rational choice is x = 1, as the responder has no incentive to reject (since rejecting also gives them 0).",

Since the responder is also self-interested and rational, they will accept any offer where their payoff (1-x) is greater than or equal to their alternative (which is 0 if they reject). Therefore, the responder will accept any offer where x <= 1. To maximize my payoff, I should propose the highest possible x that the responder will still accept, which is x = 1. However, proposing x = 1 would leave the responder with 0, and since they are rational, they might reject this offer to avoid getting nothing. To ensure acceptance, I should propose x slightly less than 1, but since the responder is rational and any x < 1 gives them a positive payoff, they will accept. Thus, the optimal strategy is to propose x = 1 - ε, where ε is an infinitesimally small positive number.

    "Analysis": "As the proposer, my goal is to maximize my own payoff. Since the responder is also self-interested and rational, they will accept any offer where their payoff (1-x) is greater than or equal to their alternative (which is 0 if they reject). Therefore, the optimal strategy is to offer the smallest possible amount that the responder would still accept. Given that the responder's payoff is (1-x), the responder will accept any x <= 1. However, since the responder is rational and self-interested, they would accept even the smallest positive amount, as rejecting would give them 0. Thus, the optimal x is to keep as much as possible while ensuring the responder still accepts, which is x = 1 - ε, where ε is an infinitesimally small amount. In practice, this can be approximated by x = 1, but since x must be <= 1, the optimal x is 1.",

    "Analysis": "As the proposer, my goal is to maximize my own payoff. The responder is also self-interested and rational, meaning they will accept any offer where their payoff (1-x) is greater than or equal to what they would get by rejecting (which is 0). Therefore, the responder will accept any offer where x <= 1. To maximize my payoff, I should propose the highest x that the responder will still accept. Since the responder gets nothing by rejecting, they should accept any x < 1. However, proposing x = 1 would leave the responder with 0, which is equivalent to rejecting, so they might reject. To ensure acceptance, I propose x slightly less than 1, but since this is a one-shot game (even with potential future interactions, the roles remain the same), the optimal strategy is to propose x = 1 - ε, where ε is infinitesimally small. In practice, this means proposing x = 1, as the responder has no incentive to reject (they are indifferent, but rejecting gains them nothing).",

The responder is rational and self-interested, so they will accept any offer where their payoff (1-x) is greater than or equal to their alternative (which is 0 if they reject). To ensure acceptance, I should offer the smallest possible (1-x) that the responder would still accept, which is just above 0. However, since the responder is rational, they will accept any (1-x) > 0. Therefore, I can maximize my payoff by proposing x = 1 - ε, where ε is an infinitesimally small positive number. In practice, this means proposing x = 1, but since x must be <= 1, the optimal proposal is x = 1. The responder will accept because (1-1) = 0 is technically not worse than rejecting (which also gives 0), and rational players are assumed to accept when indifferent.",

    "Analysis": "As the proposer, my goal is to maximize my own payoff. The responder is rational and self-interested, so they will accept any offer where their payoff (1-x) is greater than or equal to their alternative (which is 0 if they reject). To ensure acceptance, I should offer the smallest possible (1-x) that the responder would accept, which is just above 0. However, since the responder is rational, they will accept any (1-x) > 0. Therefore, the optimal strategy is to propose x = 1 - ε, where ε is an infinitesimally small positive number. In practice, this means proposing x = 1, but since x must be <= 1, the highest possible x is 1. The responder will accept because (1-1) = 0 is technically not worse than rejecting (which also gives 0), and rational players are assumed to accept when indifferent.",

The responder is also rational and self-interested, meaning they will accept any offer where their payoff (1-x) is greater than or equal to what they would get by rejecting (which is 0). Therefore, the responder will accept any x <= 1. To maximize my payoff, I should propose the highest x that the responder will accept, which is x = 1. However, if I propose x = 1, the responder gets 0 and might reject out of spite or fairness concerns, even though they are purely rational. But since the responder is purely rational and self-interested, they should accept any x < 1. To ensure acceptance and maximize my payoff, I will propose x slightly less than 1, but practically, x = 1 is the optimal choice as the responder has no incentive to reject it (they get 0 either way).",

    "Analysis": "As the proposer, my goal is to maximize my own payoff. The responder is also self-interested and rational, so they will accept any offer where their payoff (1-x) is greater than or equal to their alternative (which is 0 if they reject). To ensure acceptance, I should offer the smallest possible amount that the responder would accept, which is just above 0. However, since the responder is rational, they will accept any (1-x) > 0. Therefore, I can maximize my payoff by proposing x = 1 - ε, where ε is an infinitesimally small positive number. In practice, this means proposing x = 1, but since x must be <= 1, the optimal choice is x = 1, knowing the responder will accept because (1-1) = 0 is technically not worse than rejecting (which also gives 0). However, if the responder might reject exactly 0, then the optimal x is just below 1. Given the constraints, I choose x = 1.",

    "Analysis": "As the proposer, my goal is to maximize my own payoff. The responder is rational and self-interested, so they will accept any offer where their payoff (1-x) is greater than or equal to what they would get by rejecting (which is 0). Therefore, the responder will accept any x <= 1. To maximize my payoff, I should propose the highest x that the responder will accept, which is x = 1. However, proposing x = 1 leaves the responder with 0, which they might reject since they are indifferent. To ensure acceptance, I should propose x slightly less than 1, but since this is a one-shot game and the responder is rational, proposing x = 1 is the optimal strategy as they have no future interactions to consider for retaliation or reputation.",
