    "Analysis": "As a self-interested rational proposer, my goal is to maximize my own payoff. Since the responder is also rational and self-interested, they will accept any offer where their payoff (1-x) is greater than or equal to what they could expect to get by rejecting the offer (which is 0). Therefore, the optimal strategy is to offer the smallest possible amount that the responder would still accept. In a one-shot scenario, this would be an infinitesimally small amount greater than 0. However, since the game can loop until timestep 5, the responder might hold out for a better offer in future rounds. But given that this is the first round (timestep 0), and assuming the responder is rational, offering x = 1 (keeping all for myself) would be rejected, leading to zero payoff. To ensure acceptance, I should offer x slightly less than 1, but since the responder's alternative is 0, offering x = 0.99 (leaving 0.01 for the responder) would likely be accepted, as rejecting it would yield nothing. This maximizes my payoff while ensuring acceptance.",

Since the responder is also rational and self-interested, they will accept any offer where their payoff (1 - x) is greater than 0, as rejecting would give them nothing. The optimal strategy is to offer the smallest possible amount that the responder would still accept, which is infinitesimally greater than 0. However, since x must be a real number in [0, 1], the optimal offer is x = 1 - ε, where ε is the smallest possible positive amount. In practice, this means proposing x = 1, leaving (1 - x) = 0 for the responder. The responder would still accept this because getting 0 is no worse than rejecting (which also gives 0), and rational players are assumed to accept indifferent offers to avoid conflict.",

    "Analysis": "As the proposer, my goal is to maximize my own payoff. Since the responder is also self-interested and rational, they will accept any offer where their payoff (1 - x) is greater than or equal to what they could expect to get by rejecting the offer (which is 0, since rejection leads to no payoff). Therefore, the optimal strategy is to offer the smallest possible amount that the responder would still accept. In a one-shot scenario, this would be offering x = 1 - ε, where ε is an infinitesimally small amount, ensuring the responder gets ε and accepts. However, since this is the first timestep and the game can continue for up to 5 timesteps, the responder might reject offers that are too low in hopes of a better offer in future rounds. But since the responder is rational and knows that future rounds might not yield better offers, the optimal offer is still x = 1 - ε. For simplicity, we can approximate this as x = 1, but in practice, offering x = 0.999 would ensure acceptance while maximizing my payoff.",

Since rejecting the offer does not harm me further and there is no incentive to accept (as my payoff is the same either way), I may as well reject the offer to signal that such extreme offers are not acceptable.

This indicates that agent 1 is also rational and will reject any offer that leaves them with nothing (1 - x = 0). To ensure the offer is accepted, I must propose an x such that (1 - x) is at least the minimum amount agent 1 would accept. Since agent 1 is rational, they will accept any positive amount (1 - x > 0) because rejecting it would yield them 0. Therefore, the optimal strategy is to propose x = 1 - ε, where ε is an infinitesimally small positive number, effectively maximizing my payoff while ensuring the offer is accepted. In practice, this can be approximated by x = 0.999.",

Given the responder rejected x = 1.0, I should propose x slightly less than 1.0, but in practice, the responder will accept any x < 1.0 because (1 - x) > 0 is better than 0. However, since the responder is rational, they will accept any offer where (1 - x) >= 0, but strictly prefer (1 - x) > 0.

To ensure acceptance and maximize my own payoff, I should offer the smallest possible amount that the responder would still accept. In this case, the smallest positive amount is infinitesimally close to 0, but for practical purposes, I can offer x = 1 - ε, where ε is a very small positive number. However, since the responder is rational, they will accept even x = 1 (i.e., (1 - x) = 0), because rejecting it would also give them 0, and accepting it is at least as good.

    "Analysis": "As a self-interested rational proposer, my goal is to maximize my own payoff. The responder is also rational and self-interested, so they will accept any offer where their payoff (1 - x) is greater than 0, since rejecting the offer would give them nothing. Therefore, the optimal strategy is to offer the responder the smallest possible positive amount, which in practice is infinitesimally greater than 0. However, since the game is discrete and we are dealing with real numbers, the optimal offer is x = 1 (keeping everything for myself), but this would be rejected by the responder. The next best option is to offer x = 0.999 (leaving 0.001 for the responder), which the responder would accept because it is better than nothing. This maximizes my payoff while ensuring the responder accepts the offer.",
