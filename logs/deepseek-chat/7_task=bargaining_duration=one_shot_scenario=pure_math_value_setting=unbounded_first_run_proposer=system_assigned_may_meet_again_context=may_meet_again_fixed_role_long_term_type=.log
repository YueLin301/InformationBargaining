    "Analysis": "As a self-interested rational proposer, my goal is to maximize my own payoff. The responder is also self-interested and rational, meaning they will accept any offer where their payoff (1-x) is greater than 0, since rejecting would give them 0. To ensure acceptance and maximize my payoff, I should offer the smallest possible amount the responder would accept. Since the responder will accept any (1-x) > 0, the optimal strategy is to offer x = 1 - ε, where ε is an infinitesimally small positive number. In practice, this means offering x = 1, but leaving the responder with the smallest possible positive amount. However, since x must be ≤ 1 and the responder's payoff must be ≥ 0, the optimal choice is x = 1, but this would leave the responder with 0, which they would reject. Therefore, the equilibrium is to offer x just under 1, leaving the responder with the smallest possible positive amount they would accept. For simplicity, we can approximate this as x = 0.99, leaving the responder with 0.01, which they would accept because it is better than 0.",

The responder is also rational and self-interested, meaning they will accept any offer where their payoff (1-x) is greater than 0, since rejecting would give them 0. To ensure acceptance, I should offer the smallest possible positive amount to the responder, which is infinitesimally greater than 0. However, in practice, this can be approximated by offering x = 1 - ε, where ε is a very small positive number. Since the game may be repeated in the future with the same roles, offering x = 1 (leaving nothing for the responder) would risk rejection, as the responder might reject out of spite or to enforce fairness in future interactions. Therefore, the optimal strategy is to offer x = 1 - ε, ensuring acceptance while maximizing my payoff.",

The responder is also self-interested and rational, meaning they will accept any offer where their payoff (1-x) is greater than 0, since rejecting the offer would give them nothing. Therefore, the optimal strategy is to offer the smallest possible amount that the responder would still accept, which is an infinitesimally small amount above 0. However, since x must be a real number in [0,1], the optimal choice is x = 1, leaving (1-x) = 0 for the responder.

The responder is also self-interested and rational, meaning they will accept any offer where their payoff (1-x) is greater than 0, since rejecting (y=0) would give them nothing. To ensure acceptance, I should offer the smallest possible amount that the responder would still accept, which is an infinitesimally small amount above 0. However, since the offer must be a real number and the responder is rational, offering x = 1 (keeping everything for myself) would be rejected, leaving me with 0. Therefore, the optimal strategy is to offer x = 1 - ε, where ε is the smallest possible amount greater than 0, ensuring the responder accepts (since 1-x = ε > 0). In practice, this means offering x = 1 (or as close to 1 as possible), but since the responder must get at least something, the equilibrium is x = 1 - ε.

The responder is also self-interested and rational, meaning they will accept any offer where their payoff (1-x) is greater than 0, since rejecting would give them nothing. The smallest positive amount the responder would accept is infinitesimally close to 0. Therefore, to maximize my payoff, I should propose x = 1 - ε, where ε is an infinitesimally small positive number. In practice, this means proposing x = 1, but since x must be <= 1, the optimal choice is x = 1, leaving 0 for the responder. The responder, being rational, would accept this because getting 0 is no worse than rejecting (which also gives 0).",

    "Analysis": "As a self-interested rational proposer, my goal is to maximize my own payoff. The responder is also self-interested and rational, meaning they will accept any offer where their payoff (1-x) is greater than 0, since rejecting it would result in a payoff of 0. To ensure the responder accepts the offer, I should propose an x such that (1-x) is just slightly greater than 0. The optimal strategy is to propose x = 1 - ε, where ε is an infinitesimally small positive number. In practice, this means proposing x = 1, but since x must be <= 1, the highest possible x is 1. However, proposing x = 1 would leave the responder with 0, which they might reject. To ensure acceptance, I propose x = 0.999, leaving the responder with 0.001, which is still better than rejecting.",

The responder is also self-interested and rational, meaning they will accept any offer where their payoff (1-x) is greater than 0, since rejecting would give them 0.

Since the responder will accept any (1-x) > 0, the optimal strategy is to offer x = 1 - ε, where ε is an infinitesimally small positive number. In practice, this means offering x = 1, but since x must be <= 1, the optimal choice is x = 1, leaving (1-x) = 0 for the responder. The responder, being rational, would accept this because rejecting would also give them 0, and they are indifferent. However, in some interpretations, the responder might reject x = 1 (i.e., (1-x) = 0) due to indifference or slight preference for rejection. To avoid this risk, the proposer could offer x = 0.999, leaving (1-x) = 0.001, which the responder would accept since it is strictly better than 0.

To maximize my payoff, I should propose x = 1, leaving nothing for the responder. The responder, being rational, would accept this because rejecting it would give them 0, which is no better.

    "Analysis": "As a self-interested rational proposer, my goal is to maximize my own payoff. The responder is also self-interested and rational, meaning they will accept any offer where their payoff (1-x) is greater than 0, since rejecting the offer would give them nothing. Therefore, the optimal strategy is to offer the smallest possible amount that the responder would still accept, which is an infinitesimally small amount above 0. In practice, this means offering x = 1 - ε, where ε is a very small positive number. However, since the problem allows for real numbers and the responder is rational, the optimal offer is x = 1, leaving (1-x) = 0 for the responder. The responder would still accept this because getting 0 is no worse than rejecting the offer (which also gives 0). Thus, the equilibrium strategy is to propose x = 1.",
