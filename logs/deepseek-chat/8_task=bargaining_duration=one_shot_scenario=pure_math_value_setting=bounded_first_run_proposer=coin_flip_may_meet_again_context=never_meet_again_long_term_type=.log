The responder is rational and self-interested, so they will accept any offer where their payoff (1-2*x)/3 is greater than 0, i.e., x < 0.5.

The responder is also self-interested and rational, so they will accept any offer where their payoff is greater than or equal to zero. The responder's payoff is (1-2*x)/3, which must be >= 0 for them to accept. Solving (1-2*x)/3 >= 0 gives x <= 0.5. Since x is constrained to 0 <= x <= 0.5, the responder will accept any x in this range. My payoff is (1+2*x)/3, which increases as x increases. Therefore, to maximize my payoff, I should choose the maximum x within the range, which is x = 0.5.",

Since accepting gives me the same payoff as rejecting (0), but rejecting ensures the proposer also gets nothing, which is indifferent in terms of my payoff. However, as a purely self-interested player, I am indifferent between the two options because my payoff is the same in both cases. Since the proposer is also rational and self-interested, they have maximized their payoff at my expense.
