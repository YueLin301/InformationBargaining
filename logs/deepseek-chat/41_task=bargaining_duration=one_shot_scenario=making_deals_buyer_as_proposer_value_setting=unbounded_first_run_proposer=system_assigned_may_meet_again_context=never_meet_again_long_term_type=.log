    "Analysis": "As the proposer (buyer), my goal is to maximize my payoff, which is represented by the price x I propose. The responder (seller) will accept the offer if (1-x) is at least as good as their alternative, which in this one-shot game is getting nothing (since rejection yields 0). Since the responder is rational and self-interested, they will accept any offer where (1-x) > 0, i.e., x < 1. To maximize my payoff, I should propose the highest x that the responder will still accept. The responder's minimal acceptable (1-x) is infinitesimally greater than 0, so the optimal x is just under 1. However, since x can be any real number in [0,1], the rational choice is x = 1 - ε, where ε is an infinitesimally small positive number. In practice, this means proposing x = 1, but since x = 1 would leave the responder with 0, they would be indifferent between accepting and rejecting. To ensure acceptance, I propose x = 0.999 (or any value arbitrarily close to 1 but less than 1). This maximizes my payoff while ensuring the responder has a slight incentive to accept.",

The responder is rational and self-interested, so they will accept the offer if (1 - x) >= 0, meaning x <= 1. Since the responder gets nothing if they reject, they will accept any x < 1. To maximize my payoff, I should propose x as close to 1 as possible, but not equal to 1, because at x = 1, the responder gets 0 and might be indifferent between accepting or rejecting. To ensure acceptance, I will propose x slightly less than 1, say x = 0.99, leaving the responder with a small but positive payoff (0.01). This is the optimal strategy to maximize my expected payoff.",

The responder (seller) will accept the offer if their payoff (1-x) is at least as good as their alternative (which is 0, since rejecting gives them nothing). Since the responder is rational and self-interested, they will accept any offer where (1-x) >= 0, i.e., x <= 1. To maximize my payoff, I should propose the highest x that the responder will accept, which is x = 1. However, proposing x = 1 would leave the responder with 0, which they are indifferent to accepting or rejecting.

    "Analysis": "As the proposer, my goal is to maximize my own payoff, which is represented by x. The responder is rational and self-interested, so they will accept the offer (1-x) only if it is better than their alternative, which is getting 0 by rejecting. Since the responder's payoff is (1-x), they will accept any offer where (1-x) > 0, i.e., x < 1. However, since the responder is rational, they will also accept x = 1 because rejecting it gives them 0, which is not better. Therefore, to maximize my payoff, I should propose x = 1, as the responder has no incentive to reject it.",

 Now the proposer decides that x=1.

However, rejecting the offer could signal a preference for fairness or deter future exploitative offers, but since this is a one-time interaction, that consideration is irrelevant.
