The responder is rational and self-interested, so they will accept any offer where their payoff (1-2*x)/3 is greater than 0, i.e., x < 0.5. Since x <= 0.5, the responder will accept any x < 0.5. To maximize my payoff (1+2*x)/3, I should choose the largest x such that the responder still accepts. The largest x the responder will accept is just below 0.5. However, since x can be exactly 0.5, the responder would be indifferent between accepting and rejecting (since (1-2*0.5)/3 = 0). A rational responder might reject x = 0.5 to avoid getting nothing, but since they are indifferent, they could also accept. To ensure acceptance, I should choose x slightly less than 0.5, but since x is a real number, I can choose x = 0.5. The responder's payoff is 0, but rejecting also gives 0, so they might accept. Therefore, the optimal x is 0.5.",

The responder is also self-interested and rational, so they will accept any offer where their payoff is greater than zero. The responder's payoff is (1-2*x)/3, which must be >= 0 for them to accept. Solving (1-2*x)/3 >= 0 gives x <= 0.5. Since x is already constrained to 0 <= x <= 0.5, the responder will accept any x in this range. To maximize my payoff (1+2*x)/3, I should choose the highest possible x, which is x = 0.5. This gives me the maximum payoff of (1+2*0.5)/3 = 2/3, and the responder gets (1-2*0.5)/3 = 0, which they will accept because it is not negative.",
