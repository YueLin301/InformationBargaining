The responder is also self-interested and rational, meaning they will accept any offer where their payoff (1-x) is greater than or equal to their alternative (which is 0 if they reject). To ensure acceptance, I should offer the smallest possible amount that the responder would accept, which is just above 0. However, since the responder is rational, they will accept any (1-x) > 0. Therefore, I can maximize my payoff by proposing x = 1 - ε, where ε is an infinitesimally small positive number. In practice, this means proposing x = 1, but since x must be <= 1, the optimal choice is x = 1. The responder will accept because (1-1) = 0, which is equal to their payoff from rejecting, and rational players are indifferent but typically accept in such cases.",

    "Analysis": "As the proposer, my goal is to maximize my own payoff. The responder is also self-interested and rational, meaning they will accept any offer where their payoff (1-x) is greater than or equal to what they would get by rejecting (which is 0). Therefore, the responder will accept any offer where x <= 1. To maximize my payoff, I should propose the highest x that the responder will still accept. Since the responder gets nothing by rejecting, the minimal acceptable (1-x) is just above 0. Thus, the optimal x is 1, but the responder would reject x=1 because (1-1)=0. The next best option is to propose x just slightly less than 1, ensuring (1-x) is infinitesimally greater than 0. In practice, this means proposing x very close to 1, but for simplicity, we can consider x=0.99, which the responder would accept because (1-0.99)=0.01 > 0.",

Since the responder is also self-interested and rational, they will accept any offer where (1 - x) > 0, as rejecting would give them nothing. To ensure acceptance while maximizing my payoff, I should offer the smallest possible (1 - x) that the responder would still accept. The responder's minimal acceptable (1 - x) is epsilon > 0, but since x is a real number, I can set x arbitrarily close to 1. However, in practice, the responder would accept any x < 1. Therefore, the optimal strategy is to propose x = 1 - epsilon, where epsilon is infinitesimally small.

    "Analysis": "As a self-interested rational proposer, my goal is to maximize my own payoff. The responder is also rational and self-interested, meaning they will accept any offer where their payoff (1-x) is greater than or equal to their minimal acceptable threshold. Since the responder gets nothing if they reject, their minimal acceptable threshold is 0. However, to ensure acceptance, I should offer the smallest possible amount that the responder would accept, which is an infinitesimally small amount above 0. In practice, this means offering x = 1 - ε, where ε is a very small positive number. Since the game may be repeated in the future, offering x = 1 (leaving nothing for the responder) risks rejection, but offering x = 0.99 (leaving 0.01 for the responder) is likely to be accepted because the responder prefers a small payoff over nothing. Thus, the optimal strategy is to propose x = 0.99.",

    "Analysis": "As the proposer, my goal is to maximize my own payoff. The responder is rational and self-interested, so they will accept any offer where their payoff (1-x) is greater than or equal to their alternative (which is 0 if they reject). To ensure acceptance, I should offer the smallest possible (1-x) that the responder would still accept, which is just above 0. However, since the responder is rational, they would accept any (1-x) > 0. Therefore, I can maximize my payoff by proposing x = 1 - ε, where ε is a very small positive number. In practice, this means proposing x very close to 1, but not exactly 1, to ensure the responder accepts. Given the constraints, I will propose x = 0.99, leaving (1-x) = 0.01 for the responder, which they should accept because it is better than nothing.",

Since the responder is also self-interested and rational, they will accept any offer where (1 - x) >= 0, because rejecting the offer would give them 0. To ensure acceptance and maximize my payoff, I should propose the smallest x such that the responder still prefers accepting over rejecting. The responder's payoff is (1 - x), so they will accept any x <= 1. However, since I want to maximize my own payoff, I should propose x as close to 1 as possible while ensuring the responder still accepts. The optimal x is therefore 1, as the responder would still accept (1 - 1 = 0) because rejecting also gives 0, and they are indifferent. However, in practice, proposing x = 1 might risk rejection if the responder strictly prefers positive payoffs.

The responder is also rational and self-interested, so they will accept any offer where their payoff (1-x) is greater than or equal to their alternative (which is 0 if they reject). To ensure acceptance, I should offer the smallest possible (1-x) that the responder would accept, which is just above 0. However, since the responder is rational, they will accept any (1-x) > 0. Therefore, the optimal strategy is to propose x = 1 - ε, where ε is a very small positive number. In practice, this means proposing x = 1, but since x must be <= 1, the optimal x is 1.

    "Analysis": "As the proposer, my goal is to maximize my own payoff. The responder is rational and self-interested, so they will accept any offer where their payoff (1-x) is greater than or equal to what they would get by rejecting (which is 0). Therefore, the responder will accept any offer where x <= 1. To maximize my payoff, I should propose the highest x that the responder will accept, which is x = 1. However, proposing x = 1 would leave the responder with 0, which they are indifferent to accepting or rejecting. Assuming the responder will accept when indifferent, proposing x = 1 is optimal for me.",
