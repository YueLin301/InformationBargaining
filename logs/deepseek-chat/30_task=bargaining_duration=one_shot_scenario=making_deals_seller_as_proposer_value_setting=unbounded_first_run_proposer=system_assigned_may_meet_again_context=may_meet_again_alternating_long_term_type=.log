    "Analysis": "As the proposer, my goal is to maximize my own payoff. The responder is rational and self-interested, so they will accept any offer where their payoff (1-x) is greater than or equal to their minimal acceptable threshold. Since the responder gets nothing if they reject, their minimal acceptable threshold is 0. However, to ensure acceptance, I should offer the smallest possible (1-x) that the responder would still accept, which is infinitesimally greater than 0. Therefore, the optimal strategy is to propose x as close to 1 as possible, leaving the responder with almost nothing but still giving them a non-zero payoff to ensure acceptance. Given the constraints, the optimal x is 1 - ε, where ε is a very small positive number. For practical purposes, I can propose x = 0.999, leaving the responder with 0.001, which they will accept because it is better than nothing.",

    "Analysis": "As a self-interested rational proposer, my goal is to maximize my own payoff. The responder is also self-interested and rational, meaning they will accept any offer where their payoff (1-x) is greater than or equal to their minimal acceptable threshold. Since the responder gets nothing if they reject, their minimal acceptable threshold is likely very low (close to 0). However, to ensure acceptance, I should offer the smallest possible amount that the responder would still accept. Given that the responder is rational and self-interested, they would accept any (1-x) > 0. Therefore, I can maximize my payoff by proposing x very close to 1, leaving the responder with an infinitesimal amount (1-x) that is still greater than 0. In practice, this means proposing x = 1 - ε, where ε is a very small positive number. For simplicity, I will propose x = 0.999, leaving the responder with 0.001, which they would accept because it is better than nothing.",

    "Analysis": "As a self-interested rational proposer, my goal is to maximize my own payoff. The responder is also self-interested and rational, meaning they will accept any offer where their payoff (1-x) is greater than or equal to their alternative (which is 0 if they reject). To ensure acceptance, I should offer the smallest possible (1-x) that the responder would still accept, which is just above 0. However, since the responder is rational, they will accept any (1-x) > 0. Therefore, the optimal strategy is to propose x as close to 1 as possible, leaving the responder with the smallest possible positive amount. Given the constraints, I will propose x = 1, but since the responder would reject x = 1 (as 1-x = 0), the next best option is x slightly less than 1. For practical purposes, x = 0.99 is a reasonable choice, as it maximizes my payoff while ensuring the responder still has a small positive incentive to accept.",

    "Analysis": "As a self-interested rational proposer, my goal is to maximize my own payoff. The responder is also self-interested and rational, so they will accept any offer where their payoff (1-x) is greater than or equal to what they would get by rejecting (which is 0). Therefore, the responder will accept any x <= 1. To maximize my payoff, I should propose the highest x that the responder will accept, which is x = 1. However, if I propose x = 1, the responder gets 0, which is the same as rejecting, so they might reject. To ensure acceptance, I should propose x slightly less than 1, but since this is a one-shot game and the responder is rational, proposing x = 1 is the optimal strategy because any x < 1 leaves money on the table. The responder has no incentive to reject x = 1 because rejecting gives them the same payoff (0), and they are indifferent. However, in practice, responders might reject x = 1 out of spite or fairness concerns, but since the responder is strictly self-interested and rational, they should accept. Thus, I propose x = 1.",

The responder is also rational and self-interested, meaning they will accept any offer where their payoff (1-x) is greater than or equal to what they would get by rejecting (which is 0). To ensure acceptance, I should offer the smallest possible (1-x) that the responder would still accept, which is just above 0. However, since the responder is rational, they will accept any (1-x) > 0. Therefore, I can maximize my payoff by setting x as close to 1 as possible, leaving the responder with just enough to make acceptance preferable to rejection. In practice, this means setting x = 1 - ε, where ε is a very small positive number.

The responder is also self-interested and rational, so they will accept any offer where their payoff (1-x) is greater than or equal to their minimal acceptable threshold. Since the responder's minimal acceptable threshold is likely to be 0 (as rejecting the offer gives them nothing), they will accept any offer where x <= 1. To maximize my payoff, I should propose x = 1, which the responder will accept because (1-1) = 0 is still better than rejecting (which gives them 0).

    "Analysis": "As a self-interested rational proposer, my goal is to maximize my own payoff. The responder is also self-interested and rational, so they will accept any offer where their payoff (1-x) is greater than or equal to 0. Since the responder gets nothing if they reject, they will accept any x <= 1. To maximize my payoff, I should propose x = 1, leaving nothing for the responder. However, this risks rejection if the responder strictly prefers to reject when indifferent (i.e., when 1-x = 0). To ensure acceptance, I can propose x slightly less than 1, but since the responder is rational and prefers any positive payoff over nothing, x = 1 is the optimal choice.",
