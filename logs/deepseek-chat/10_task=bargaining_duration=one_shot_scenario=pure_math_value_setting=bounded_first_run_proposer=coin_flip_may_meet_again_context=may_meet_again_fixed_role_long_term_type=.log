    "Analysis": "As the proposer, my goal is to maximize my own payoff. The responder is rational and self-interested, so they will accept any offer where their payoff (1-2*x)/3 is greater than or equal to 0. Since (1-2*x)/3 >= 0 implies x <= 0.5, which is always true given the constraint 0 <= x <= 0.5. However, the responder will reject any offer where (1-2*x)/3 < 0, but this cannot happen under the given constraints. Therefore, the responder will accept any x in [0, 0.5]. To maximize my payoff (1+2*x)/3, I should choose the largest possible x, which is x = 0.5. This gives me the highest possible payoff of (1+2*0.5)/3 = 2/3, while the responder gets (1-2*0.5)/3 = 0. Since the responder is rational and gets 0, they are indifferent between accepting or rejecting, but rejecting would give them 0 as well, so they have no incentive to reject. Thus, x = 0.5 is the optimal choice.",

    "Analysis": "As the proposer, my goal is to maximize my own payoff. The responder is rational and self-interested, so they will accept any offer where their payoff (1-2*x)/3 is greater than 0. The responder's payoff is positive when x < 0.5. Since x can be up to 0.5, the optimal strategy is to propose x = 0.5, which maximizes my payoff (1+2*0.5)/3 = 2/3, while the responder's payoff is (1-2*0.5)/3 = 0. The responder will accept this because rejecting it gives them 0, and they are indifferent between accepting and rejecting. However, since they are self-interested, they might accept to avoid the risk of future retaliation or to maintain a cooperative relationship in repeated interactions, but in a one-shot game, they are indifferent. Thus, proposing x = 0.5 is optimal.",

    "Analysis": "As a self-interested rational responder, my goal is to maximize my own payoff. The proposer has chosen x=0.5, which means the offer is (1-2*0.5)/3 = 0 for me. If I accept (y=1), I get 0, and the proposer gets (1+2*0.5)/3 = 2/3. If I reject (y=0), both get 0. Since 0 is equal to 0, rejecting the offer does not provide a better payoff, but it also does not worsen it. However, rejecting could signal to the proposer in future interactions that such extreme offers are not acceptable, potentially leading to better offers later. But since this is a one-shot game (no future interactions guaranteed), the rational choice is to accept any offer where my payoff is >= 0. Here, it is exactly 0, so I am indifferent. However, strictly rational behavior would still accept since rejecting doesn't improve my payoff.",
