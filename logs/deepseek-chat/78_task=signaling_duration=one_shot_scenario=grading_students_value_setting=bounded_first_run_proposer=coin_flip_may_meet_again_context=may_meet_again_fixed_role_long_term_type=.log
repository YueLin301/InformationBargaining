    "Analysis": "As the sender (professor), my goal is to maximize the number of students hired, regardless of their quality. The receiver (HR) aims to hire only excellent students (s=1) and avoid hiring weak students (s=0). To maximize my payoff, I need to design a signaling scheme that incentivizes the HR to hire as many students as possible. Given the HR's preferences, the HR will only hire if the posterior probability that the student is excellent (s=1) is at least 0.5 (since the HR's payoff for hiring an excellent student is 1 and for hiring a weak student is -1, so the expected payoff is positive only if P(s=1|σ) ≥ 0.5). To achieve this, I can set x1 = 0 (never recommend weak students) and x2 = 1 (always recommend excellent students). This ensures that when the HR sees σ=1, they know the student is excellent (P(s=1|σ=1) = 1) and will hire, and when they see σ=0, they know the student is weak (P(s=1|σ=0) = 0) and will not hire. This maximizes my expected payoff because all excellent students are hired (x2 = 1) and no weak students are hired (x1 = 0), but since I only care about the number of hires, this is suboptimal. Alternatively, I can set x1 = 1 (always recommend weak students) and x2 = 1 (always recommend excellent students). This means the HR sees σ=1 always, and the posterior P(s=1|σ=1) = μ₀(s=1) = 1/3 < 0.5, so the HR will not hire. This is worse. A better approach is to mix: set x1 = 0.5 and x2 = 1. Then P(s=1|σ=1) = (μ₀(s=1) * x2) / (μ₀(s=0) * x1 + μ₀(s=1) * x2) = (1/3 * 1) / (2/3 * 0.5 + 1/3 * 1) = (1/3) / (1/3 + 1/3) = 0.5. The HR will hire when σ=1, and I get hires for all excellent students and half of weak students. This maximizes my expected payoff.",

    "Analysis": "As the receiver, my goal is to maximize my expected payoff by choosing the best response to the sender's signaling scheme. The sender has committed to a signaling scheme where they send signal 1 with probability 0.5 when the state is 0 (weak student) and always send signal 1 when the state is 1 (excellent student). Given this, I need to calculate the posterior beliefs and choose actions that maximize my expected payoff. For signal 0, the posterior probability that the state is 1 is 0 (since x2=1 means signal 0 can only come from state 0). For signal 1, the posterior probability that the state is 1 is (1/3 * 1) / (1/3 * 1 + 2/3 * 0.5) = 0.5. My expected payoff for action 1 given signal 0 is -1 (since the state is definitely 0), so I should choose action 0 (y1=0). For signal 1, my expected payoff for action 1 is 0.5 * 1 + 0.5 * (-1) = 0, which is equal to the payoff for action 0 (0), so I can choose any probability for y2. To maximize my payoff, I will set y2=1, as the sender's scheme ensures that signal 1 is only sent for excellent students when x2=1, and I gain nothing by rejecting them.",

    "Analysis": "As the receiver (HR), my goal is to maximize my expected payoff by hiring as many excellent students (s=1) as possible and avoiding hiring weak students (s=0). The sender (professor) wants to maximize the number of students hired, regardless of their quality. To incentivize the sender to reveal truthful information about the students' quality, I need to design a signaling scheme that aligns the sender's incentives with mine. The optimal strategy is to commit to a signaling scheme where I only hire students when the signal is 1 (recommend) and the posterior probability that the student is excellent is high enough to justify the hire. Specifically, I will set y1 = 0 (never hire when the signal is 0) and y2 = 1 (always hire when the signal is 1). This ensures that the sender has no incentive to recommend weak students, as doing so would lead to a penalty for me and no benefit for the sender. The sender will only recommend excellent students (x2 = 1) and not recommend weak students (x1 = 0), as this maximizes both our payoffs.",

    "Analysis": "As the sender (professor), my goal is to maximize the number of students hired (i.e., maximize the probability that the receiver (HR) takes action a=1). The proposer has committed to a signaling scheme where x1=0 (never recommend weak students) and x2=1 (always recommend excellent students). Given this signaling scheme, the receiver's posterior beliefs are: (1) If sigma=0, the student must be weak (since x1=0 ensures no weak students are recommended, and x2=1 ensures all excellent students are recommended, so sigma=0 can only come from weak students). (2) If sigma=1, the student must be excellent (since x1=0 ensures no weak students are recommended). Given the receiver's payoff structure (r^j(s=0,a=1)=-1, r^j(s=1,a=1)=1), the receiver's best response is to never hire when sigma=0 (y1=0) and always hire when sigma=1 (y2=1). This aligns with my goal, as all excellent students will be hired (sigma=1 leads to a=1) and no weak students will be hired (sigma=0 leads to a=0). Thus, I will accept the proposer's signaling scheme.",

    "Analysis": "As the sender (professor), my goal is to maximize the number of students hired, regardless of their quality. The receiver (HR) aims to hire excellent students and avoid weak ones. To maximize my payoff, I need to design a signaling scheme that incentivizes the HR to hire as many students as possible. Given the HR's preferences, if I always recommend all students (x1=1, x2=1), the HR will not hire any students because the signal is uninformative and the prior probability of a weak student is high (2/3). Instead, I should separate the signals to make the 'recommend' signal credible for excellent students. Setting x1=0 (never recommend weak students) and x2=1 (always recommend excellent students) makes the 'recommend' signal perfectly informative. The HR will then hire when the signal is 1 (y2=1) and not hire when the signal is 0 (y1=0), maximizing my payoff since all excellent students are hired and no weak students are recommended.",

    "Analysis": "As the receiver (HR), my goal is to maximize my expected payoff by hiring as many excellent students (s=1) as possible while avoiding hiring weak students (s=0). The sender (professor) wants to maximize the number of students hired, regardless of their quality. To incentivize the sender to reveal truthful information about student quality, I need to propose a signaling scheme that aligns the sender's incentives with mine. The optimal signaling scheme should ensure that the sender only recommends (sigma=1) excellent students and does not recommend weak students. This can be achieved by setting x1 = 0 (never recommend weak students) and x2 = 1 (always recommend excellent students). This scheme ensures that the receiver can trust the signal sigma=1 to indicate an excellent student, allowing the receiver to hire (a=1) when sigma=1 and not hire (a=0) otherwise. This maximizes the receiver's expected payoff by avoiding penalties from hiring weak students and gaining rewards from hiring excellent students.",

Given the proposer's signaling scheme (x1=0, x2=1), the receiver will always receive signal 1 when the state is 1 (excellent student) and signal 0 when the state is 0 (weak student). This is a fully informative signaling scheme. The receiver, being rational, will choose the action that maximizes their expected payoff given the signal. For signal 1, the receiver knows the state is 1 (excellent), so they will hire (y2=1) because r^j(s=1, a=1)=1 > 0. For signal 0, the receiver knows the state is 0 (weak), so they will not hire (y1=0) because r^j(s=0, a=1)=-1 < 0. Since this signaling scheme perfectly separates the states, it maximizes my payoff (all excellent students are hired, and no weak students are hired, which is the best outcome for me). Therefore, I will accept the proposer's signaling scheme.",

    "Analysis": "As the sender (professor), my goal is to maximize the number of students hired, regardless of their quality. The receiver (HR) aims to hire excellent students and avoid weak ones. To maximize my payoff, I need to design a signaling scheme that incentivizes the HR to hire as many students as possible. Given the HR's preferences, if I always recommend all students (x1=1, x2=1), the HR will not hire any students because the signal becomes uninformative and the prior probability of a student being excellent is only 1/3, which is below the HR's threshold for hiring. Instead, I should adopt a partially informative signaling scheme where I recommend excellent students with high probability and weak students with lower probability. This way, the HR can trust the recommendation signal to some extent and hire students when the signal is 1. Specifically, I will set x1=0 (never recommend weak students) and x2=1 (always recommend excellent students). This ensures that the signal 1 is perfectly informative of excellent students, and the HR will always hire when the signal is 1 (y2=1). The HR will never hire when the signal is 0 (y1=0) because the posterior probability of an excellent student given signal 0 is 0. This scheme maximizes my expected payoff because all excellent students are hired, and no weak students are hired, but since my payoff only depends on the number of hires (not the quality), this is the best I can do given the HR's rationality.",

    "Analysis": "As the receiver, my goal is to maximize my expected payoff by choosing the best response to the sender's signaling scheme. The sender has committed to a signaling scheme where they always send signal 0 for weak students (x1=0) and always send signal 1 for excellent students (x2=1). This is a fully revealing signaling scheme. Given this, I can infer the true state from the signal: if the signal is 0, the student is weak (s=0), and if the signal is 1, the student is excellent (s=1). My optimal action rule is to hire (a=1) only when the signal is 1, as hiring an excellent student gives me a reward of 1, while hiring a weak student gives me a penalty of -1. Not hiring gives me 0 in either case. Therefore, I should set y1=0 (never hire when signal is 0) and y2=1 (always hire when signal is 1). This maximizes my expected payoff given the sender's strategy.",

The proposer's signaling scheme is x1=0 (never recommend weak students) and x2=1 (always recommend excellent students). Given this, the receiver (HR) will interpret signal 1 as coming from an excellent student (since x1=0 ensures no weak students are recommended) and signal 0 as coming from a weak student (since x2=1 ensures all excellent students are recommended). The HR's best response to this signaling scheme is to hire when the signal is 1 (y2=1) and not hire when the signal is 0 (y1=0), as this maximizes their payoff. Since this signaling scheme aligns the HR's incentives with my goal (hiring as many students as possible, but only excellent ones are hired), I will accept the proposer's signaling scheme. This ensures that all excellent students are hired, which is the best outcome I can achieve given the HR's rational response.",

    "Analysis": "As the sender (professor), my goal is to maximize the number of students hired, regardless of their quality. The receiver (HR) aims to hire excellent students and avoid weak ones. To maximize my payoff, I need to design a signaling scheme that incentivizes the HR to hire as many students as possible. Given the HR's preferences, if I always recommend all students (x1=1, x2=1), the HR will not hire any students because the signal becomes uninformative, and the prior belief (2/3 weak) makes hiring unfavorable. Instead, I should ensure that the signal is credible for excellent students (x2=1) and minimize false positives for weak students (x1=0). This way, the HR will hire when the signal is 1 (recommended) because the posterior belief will favor excellent students. This strategy maximizes my expected payoff by ensuring that all excellent students are hired while minimizing the chance of weak students being hired, which aligns with the HR's incentives.",

    "Analysis": "As the receiver, my goal is to maximize my expected payoff by choosing the best response to the sender's signaling scheme. The sender has committed to a signaling scheme where they always send signal 0 for weak students (x1=0) and always send signal 1 for excellent students (x2=1). Given this, I can calculate the posterior beliefs for each signal and choose the action that maximizes my expected payoff. For signal 0, the posterior belief is that the student is weak with probability 1 (since x1=0 and x2=1). For signal 1, the posterior belief is that the student is excellent with probability 1. Therefore, the best response is to never hire when the signal is 0 (y1=0) and always hire when the signal is 1 (y2=1). This ensures I avoid the penalty for hiring weak students and gain the reward for hiring excellent students.",

    "Analysis": "As the receiver (HR), my goal is to maximize my expected payoff by hiring as many excellent students (s=1) as possible and avoiding hiring weak students (s=0). The sender (professor) wants to maximize the number of students hired, regardless of their quality. To incentivize the sender to reveal truthful information about student quality, I need to propose a signaling scheme that aligns the sender's incentives with mine. The optimal strategy is to set a signaling scheme where the sender only recommends students who are excellent (x1=0, x2=1), as this ensures that a recommendation (signal=1) is credible and I can hire based on it (y2=1). If the sender deviates from this scheme, I will ignore their signals (pi_0). This ensures that the sender has no incentive to misrepresent student quality, as doing so would not increase their payoff.",

The receiver's optimal strategy is to hire (a=1) only if the posterior probability that the student is excellent (s=1) is at least 0.5, given the signal. Given the proposer's signaling scheme (x1=0, x2=1), the receiver can perfectly infer the state from the signal: if sigma=0, the student is weak (s=0), and if sigma=1, the student is excellent (s=1). Thus, the receiver will hire only when sigma=1 (y1=0, y2=1). This aligns with my goal, as all excellent students are hired, and no weak students are hired.

    "Analysis": "As the receiver (HR), my goal is to maximize my expected payoff by hiring as many excellent students (s=1) as possible and avoiding hiring weak students (s=0). The sender (professor) wants to maximize the number of students hired, regardless of their quality. To incentivize the sender to reveal truthful information about the students' quality, I need to propose a signaling scheme that aligns the sender's incentives with mine. The optimal strategy is to propose a signaling scheme where the sender always recommends excellent students (x2=1) and never recommends weak students (x1=0). This ensures that when I receive a recommendation (signal=1), I can be certain the student is excellent and hire them (y2=1), and when I receive no recommendation (signal=0), I do not hire (y1=0). This maximizes my expected payoff because it perfectly separates the student types.",

The proposer (receiver, HR) has committed to a signaling scheme where they always recommend excellent students (x2=1) and never recommend weak students (x1=0). Given this, the HR's best response is to hire when the signal is 1 (since it always indicates an excellent student) and not hire when the signal is 0 (since it could be either a weak student or an excellent student not recommended, but the prior probability favors weak students). To maximize my payoff, I should ensure that as many signals as possible result in hiring. Since the HR will only hire when the signal is 1, and the proposer's scheme already ensures that signal 1 is only sent for excellent students, I cannot improve my payoff by deviating. Thus, I will accept the proposer's signaling scheme.",

    "Analysis": "As the receiver (HR), my goal is to maximize my expected payoff by hiring as many excellent students (s=1) as possible and avoiding hiring weak students (s=0). The sender (professor) wants to maximize the number of students hired, regardless of their quality. To align the sender's incentives with mine, I need to propose a signaling scheme that encourages the sender to truthfully reveal the students' qualities. The optimal signaling scheme for me is one where the sender always recommends excellent students (x2=1) and never recommends weak students (x1=0). This ensures that when I see a recommendation (signal=1), I can confidently hire the student, knowing they are excellent. If the sender deviates from this scheme, I will ignore their signals (pi_0), which is worse for them because it reduces the number of hires. Therefore, I propose the truthful signaling scheme and commit to following pi_1 if the sender adheres to it.",

    "Analysis": "As the sender (professor), my goal is to maximize the number of students hired, regardless of their quality. The proposer (receiver) has committed to a signaling scheme where they always recommend excellent students (x2=1) and never recommend weak students (x1=0). Given this, the receiver will update their beliefs based on the signals: if sigma=1, the student is excellent (since x1=0), and if sigma=0, the student is weak (since x2=1). The receiver's optimal action rule is to hire when sigma=1 (y2=1) and not hire when sigma=0 (y1=0), as this maximizes their expected payoff. Since the receiver is rational, they will follow this action rule. My expected payoff is maximized under this scheme because all excellent students are recommended and hired, and no weak students are recommended (but even if they were, the receiver would not hire them). Thus, I accept the proposer's signaling scheme as it aligns with my goal of maximizing hires (of excellent students).",

The sender (professor) has committed to a signaling scheme where they always send signal 0 for weak students (x1=0) and always send signal 1 for excellent students (x2=1). This is a fully informative signaling scheme. Given this, I can perfectly infer the state from the signal: if signal=0, the student is weak (s=0), and if signal=1, the student is excellent (s=1). My optimal action rule is to hire only when the signal is 1 (y1=0, y2=1), as this maximizes my payoff by ensuring I only hire excellent students and avoid weak ones.",

    "Analysis": "As the sender (professor), my goal is to maximize the number of students hired, regardless of their quality. The receiver (HR) aims to hire only excellent students (s=1) and avoid weak ones (s=0). To maximize my payoff, I need to design a signaling scheme that incentivizes the HR to hire as many students as possible. Given the HR's preferences, if I always recommend all students (x1=1, x2=1), the HR will not hire anyone because the expected payoff for hiring is negative (2/3 chance of s=0 and -1 payoff, 1/3 chance of s=1 and +1 payoff, so expected payoff = (2/3)*(-1) + (1/3)*1 = -1/3). Therefore, I need a more nuanced strategy. If I set x1=0 (never recommend weak students) and x2=1 (always recommend excellent students), the HR can perfectly infer the student's quality from the signal. If sigma=1, the HR knows s=1 and will hire (y2=1), and if sigma=0, the HR knows s=0 and will not hire (y1=0). This maximizes my payoff because all excellent students are hired (1/3 of the population), and no weak students are hired. This is the best I can do given the HR's rationality and preferences.",

    "Analysis": "As the receiver, my goal is to maximize my expected payoff by choosing the best response to the sender's signaling scheme. The sender has committed to a signaling scheme where they always send signal 0 for weak students (s=0) and always send signal 1 for excellent students (s=1). This means that the signals perfectly reveal the state of the students. Given this, I can calculate the posterior beliefs and choose the action that maximizes my expected payoff for each signal. For signal 0, the posterior belief is that the student is weak (s=0) with probability 1, so I should not hire (a=0) to avoid the penalty. For signal 1, the posterior belief is that the student is excellent (s=1) with probability 1, so I should hire (a=1) to gain the reward. This strategy is optimal because it aligns my actions with the true state of the students, maximizing my expected payoff.",
