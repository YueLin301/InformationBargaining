The responder is rational and self-interested, so they will accept any offer where their payoff (1-x) is greater than or equal to 0.

However, the responder might reject x = 1 because their payoff would be 0, which is the same as rejecting. To ensure acceptance, I should propose x slightly less than 1, but since the responder is rational and will accept any x < 1, the optimal x is the highest value just below 1. In practice, x = 1 is the limit, but to avoid rejection, I can propose x = 0.999, which the responder will accept because 1 - 0.999 = 0.001 > 0.",

    "Analysis": "As the proposer, my goal is to maximize my own payoff, which is represented by x. The responder is also self-interested and rational, meaning they will accept the offer (1-x) if it is better than or equal to their alternative (which is 0, since rejecting gives them nothing). To ensure acceptance, I should offer the responder the smallest possible amount that they would still accept, which is an infinitesimally small amount above 0. However, since x must be a real number between 0 and 1, I can propose x = 1 - ε, where ε is a very small positive number. In practice, this means proposing x = 1, but since the responder would reject x = 1 (as they get 0), the optimal x is just below 1, where the responder gets an infinitesimal positive amount. For simplicity and to ensure acceptance, I will propose x = 0.99, leaving the responder with 0.01, which they will accept because it is better than nothing.",

    "Analysis": "As the proposer, my goal is to maximize my own payoff, which is represented by x. The responder is also self-interested and rational, meaning they will accept the offer (1-x) only if it is better than rejecting it (which gives them 0). Therefore, the responder will accept any offer where (1-x) > 0, i.e., x < 1. Since the responder is rational, they will accept even the smallest positive offer. To maximize my payoff, I should propose the highest x that the responder will still accept. The smallest positive amount the responder would accept is infinitesimally close to 0, but in practice, I can propose x = 1 - ε, where ε is a very small positive number. However, since the game is played once and there is no room for negotiation, the optimal strategy is to propose x = 1, knowing that the responder will reject it, but any x < 1 would leave some payoff for the responder. Given the responder's rationality, the equilibrium is to propose x = 1 - ε, but practically, the highest x that can be proposed is x = 1, leading to rejection. However, proposing x slightly less than 1 (e.g., x = 0.99) ensures the responder accepts, giving me a payoff of 0.99.",

    "Analysis": "As the proposer, my goal is to maximize my own payoff. The responder is rational and self-interested, so they will accept any offer where their payoff (1-x) is greater than or equal to their alternative (which is 0, since rejecting gives them nothing). Therefore, to ensure acceptance while maximizing my payoff, I should offer the smallest possible (1-x) that the responder would accept. The responder will accept any (1-x) > 0, but since they are rational, they would also accept (1-x) = 0 because rejecting gives them the same payoff (0). However, offering (1-x) = 0 would leave them indifferent, and a rational responder might reject. To guarantee acceptance, I should offer an infinitesimally small (1-x), but since x must be a real number in [0,1], the optimal strategy is to offer x = 1 - ε, where ε is the smallest possible positive amount. In practice, this means proposing x = 1, but this would lead to rejection. Therefore, the optimal x is the highest value where (1-x) is just acceptable, which is x = 1 - ε. For simplicity, we can approximate this as x = 0.999, ensuring the responder gets a negligible but positive payoff (0.001), which they would accept.",

The responder is rational and self-interested, so they will accept any offer where their payoff (1-x) is greater than or equal to 0. Since the responder gets nothing if they reject, they will accept any x <= 1. To maximize my payoff, I should propose x = 1, leaving nothing for the responder. The responder, being rational, will accept this because rejecting it would give them 0, which is not better than accepting (1-1 = 0).",
