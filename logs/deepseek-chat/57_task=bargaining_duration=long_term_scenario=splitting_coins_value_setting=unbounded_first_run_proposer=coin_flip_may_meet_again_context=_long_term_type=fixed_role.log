Since the responder is also rational and self-interested, they will accept any offer where their payoff (1-x) is greater than or equal to what they would expect to get by rejecting the offer (which is 0). The optimal strategy is to offer the responder the smallest possible amount they would accept, which is just above 0. However, since the responder is rational, they would accept any positive amount. Therefore, I should propose to keep almost the entire amount for myself, leaving the responder with the smallest possible positive amount.
