    "Analysis": "As the proposer, my goal is to maximize my own payoff. The responder is rational and self-interested, so they will accept any offer where their payoff (1-x) is greater than or equal to their minimal acceptable threshold. Since the responder's minimal acceptable threshold is likely to be 0 (as rejecting gives them 0), they will accept any offer where (1-x) >= 0, i.e., x <= 1. To maximize my payoff, I should propose x as close to 1 as possible while ensuring the responder still accepts. The optimal strategy is to propose x = 1 - ε, where ε is a very small positive number. However, since the responder is rational and will accept any x < 1, the optimal x is 1 (or just below 1 in practice). Given the constraints, I propose x = 1, knowing the responder will accept because (1-1) = 0, which is equal to their payoff from rejecting.",

Therefore, the responder will accept any x <= 1. To maximize my payoff, I should propose the highest x that the responder will accept, which is x = 1. However, proposing x = 1 would leave the responder with 0, and since they are rational, they might reject it to avoid getting nothing. But since the responder is self-interested, they might accept x = 1 because rejecting it gives them 0 anyway. However, in practice, the responder might reject x = 1 to avoid being exploited. To ensure acceptance, I can propose x slightly less than 1, but since the responder is rational and the game might be repeated, proposing x = 1 is the most rational choice for me.",

    "Analysis": "As the proposer, my goal is to maximize my own payoff. The responder is rational and self-interested, so they will accept any offer where their payoff (1-x) is greater than or equal to what they would get by rejecting (which is 0). Therefore, the responder will accept any x <= 1. To maximize my payoff, I should propose the highest x that the responder will accept, which is x = 1. However, if I propose x = 1, the responder gets 0, which is the same as rejecting, so they might reject. To ensure acceptance, I should propose x slightly less than 1, but since this is a one-shot game (with potential future interactions), the optimal strategy is to propose x = 1 - ε, where ε is infinitesimally small. In practice, x = 1 is the limit, but the responder would reject. Thus, the Nash equilibrium in this one-shot game is to propose x = 1, knowing the responder will accept because rejecting gives them 0, and they are indifferent. However, to ensure acceptance, I propose x = 0.99, leaving the responder with 0.01, which they will accept because it's better than 0.",
    "Decision": 0.99
}
Proposal:
 Now the proposer decides that x=0.99.

However, proposing x = 1 would leave the responder with 0, and they might reject it out of spite or fairness, but since the responder is strictly rational and self-interested, they should accept even x = 1 because rejecting gives them 0, which is not better.

The responder is rational and self-interested, so they will accept any offer where their payoff (1-x) is greater than or equal to their alternative (which is 0 if they reject). To ensure acceptance, I should offer the smallest possible (1-x) that the responder would accept, which is just above 0. However, since the responder is rational, they will accept any (1-x) > 0, as rejecting gives them 0. Therefore, the optimal strategy is to propose x as close to 1 as possible, leaving the responder with just enough to make acceptance preferable to rejection. In practice, this means proposing x = 1 - ε, where ε is a very small positive number. Given the constraints, the optimal x is 1, but since the responder would reject x = 1 (as 1-x = 0), the next best is x = 0.99, leaving the responder with 0.01, which they would accept because it is better than 0.",

    "Analysis": "As the proposer, my goal is to maximize my own payoff. The responder is rational and self-interested, so they will accept any offer where their payoff (1-x) is greater than or equal to their reservation payoff. Since the game could be repeated in the future, offering a minimal acceptable amount to the responder (epsilon above 0) would maximize my payoff. However, in a one-shot game or when future interactions are uncertain, the rational choice for the responder is to accept any positive offer. Therefore, I can propose x = 1 - epsilon, where epsilon is a very small positive number, to maximize my payoff while ensuring the responder accepts. For simplicity, I will choose x = 0.99, leaving the responder with 0.01, which they will accept because it is better than nothing.",

    "Analysis": "As the proposer, my goal is to maximize my own payoff. Since the responder is also self-interested and rational, they will accept any offer where (1-x) >= 0, i.e., x <= 1. To maximize my payoff, I should propose the highest x that the responder would still accept. The responder's minimal acceptable payoff is 0, so I can set x = 1, leaving (1-x) = 0 for the responder. The responder, being rational, would accept this because rejecting it would give them 0 as well, and accepting it does not make them worse off. Therefore, the optimal strategy is to propose x = 1.",
