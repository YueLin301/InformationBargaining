    "Analysis": "As a self-interested rational proposer, my goal is to maximize my own payoff. The responder is also self-interested and rational, meaning they will accept any offer where their payoff (1-x) is greater than 0, since rejecting would give them 0. Therefore, the optimal strategy is to offer the smallest possible amount that the responder would still accept, which is an infinitesimally small amount more than 0. In practice, this means offering x = 1 - ε, where ε is a very small positive number. However, since the problem allows for real numbers and the responder is rational, I can set x = 1, knowing that the responder would still accept (1-x) = 0 because rejecting would also give them 0, and they are indifferent. But to ensure acceptance, I will choose x = 0.999, leaving 0.001 for the responder, which is strictly better than rejecting.",

    "Analysis": "As a self-interested rational proposer, my goal is to maximize my own payoff. The responder is also self-interested and rational, meaning they will accept any offer where their payoff (1-x) is greater than 0, since rejecting would give them 0. Therefore, the optimal strategy is to offer the smallest possible amount that the responder would still accept, which is infinitesimally greater than 0. In practice, this means offering x = 1 - ε, where ε is a very small positive number. However, since the problem allows for real numbers and the responder is rational, setting x = 1 (leaving 0 for the responder) would technically be rejected, but any x < 1 would be accepted. To maximize my payoff, I will choose x as close to 1 as possible while ensuring the responder still prefers accepting over rejecting. Thus, the optimal choice is x = 1 (or just below 1, but since the responder is rational, they would accept even x = 1, as rejecting gives them 0, which is not better).",

    "Analysis": "As a self-interested rational proposer, my goal is to maximize my own payoff. The responder is also self-interested and rational, meaning they will accept any offer where their payoff (1-x) is greater than 0, since rejecting it would yield 0. To ensure acceptance, I should offer the smallest possible positive amount to the responder, which is infinitesimally greater than 0. In practice, this means offering x = 1 - ε, where ε is an arbitrarily small positive number. However, since the game is played once and the responder is rational, offering x = 1 (leaving 0 for the responder) would be rejected, as the responder gets nothing and is indifferent. Therefore, the optimal strategy is to offer x = 1 - ε, but in a discrete or practical setting, the closest approximation is x = 1 (or just under 1), knowing the responder will accept any positive amount.",

The responder is also self-interested and rational, meaning they will accept any offer where their payoff (1-x) is greater than 0, since rejecting the offer would result in a payoff of 0. To ensure the responder accepts the offer, I should propose the smallest possible x that still leaves the responder with a positive payoff. However, since the responder is rational, they will accept even the smallest positive amount. Therefore, the optimal strategy is to propose x = 1 - ε, where ε is an infinitesimally small positive number. In practice, this means proposing x = 1, leaving the responder with 0, but since the responder is indifferent between accepting 0 and rejecting (both yield 0), they might still accept. However, to strictly ensure acceptance, I should propose x slightly less than 1, but for simplicity and maximum payoff, I will propose x = 1.",

    "Analysis": "As a self-interested rational proposer, my goal is to maximize my own payoff. The responder is also self-interested and rational, meaning they will accept any offer where their payoff (1 - x) is greater than 0, since rejecting would give them 0. To ensure the offer is accepted, I should propose an x such that (1 - x) is just slightly greater than 0. The optimal x is therefore very close to 1, leaving the responder with the smallest possible positive amount.

The responder is also self-interested and rational, meaning they will accept any offer where their payoff (1-x) is greater than 0, since rejecting it would result in a payoff of 0. To ensure the responder accepts the offer, I should propose an x such that (1-x) is just slightly greater than 0. The optimal strategy is to propose x = 1 - ε, where ε is an infinitesimally small positive number. In practice, this means proposing x = 1, but since x must be <= 1, the rational choice is to propose x = 1, leaving nothing for the responder. However, the responder would reject x = 1 because (1-x) = 0, which is equivalent to rejecting. Therefore, the optimal x is the largest value less than 1, but since we are dealing with real numbers, the limit is x approaching 1.

    "Analysis": "As a self-interested rational proposer, my goal is to maximize my own payoff. The responder is also self-interested and rational, meaning they will accept any offer where their payoff (1-x) is greater than 0, since rejecting would give them 0. To ensure acceptance, I should offer the smallest possible amount that the responder would accept, which is an infinitesimally small amount above 0. However, since the game is discrete and the responder is rational, offering x = 1 (leaving 0 for the responder) would still be rejected, as the responder gets nothing. Therefore, the optimal strategy is to offer x = 1 - ε, where ε is the smallest possible positive amount, effectively maximizing my payoff while ensuring the responder accepts. In practice, this means proposing x = 1 (or as close to 1 as possible), but since the responder must get at least something to accept, the exact value depends on the smallest definable ε. For simplicity, we can consider x = 0.99, leaving 0.01 for the responder, which they would accept because it is better than 0.",

    "Analysis": "As a self-interested rational proposer, my goal is to maximize my own payoff. The responder is also self-interested and rational, so they will accept any offer where their payoff (1-x) is greater than 0, since rejecting would give them 0. To ensure acceptance and maximize my payoff, I should offer the smallest possible amount that the responder would still accept. Since the responder is rational, they would accept any x < 1, but at x = 1, they are indifferent. However, in practice, the smallest positive amount is not well-defined, so the optimal strategy is to offer x = 1 (i.e., keep everything for myself), knowing that the responder would reject it, but any x < 1 would leave me with less. However, this leads to a payoff of 0 for both. Therefore, the subgame perfect Nash equilibrium in this one-shot game is to offer x = 1 (or as close to 1 as possible), but since the responder would reject x = 1, the practical equilibrium is to offer x just slightly less than 1 (e.g., x = 0.999), which the responder would accept, giving me almost the entire amount.",
