However, the responder will reject if their payoff is negative, but since x <= 0.5, their payoff is always non-negative. Therefore, the responder will accept any x in [0, 0.5]. To maximize my payoff (1+2*x)/3, I should choose the highest possible x, which is x = 0.5.

To maximize my payoff, I should choose the highest possible x, which is x = 0.5. This gives me the maximum payoff of (1+2*0.5)/3 = 2/3, while the responder gets (1-2*0.5)/3 = 0.
