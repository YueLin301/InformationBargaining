Since both options yield the same payoff, and there is no future consideration (as the game is played once with the same roles), I am indifferent between accepting or rejecting.

The responder will accept the offer if (1-2*x)/3 is greater than or equal to their alternative (which is 0 in this case, since rejection yields nothing). Therefore, the responder will accept any x <= 0.5. However, since x is constrained to be <= 0.5, the optimal x for me is 0.5, as it maximizes my payoff (1+2*0.5)/3 = 2/3.

The responder will accept the offer if (1-2*x)/3 is greater than or equal to their payoff from rejecting (which is 0). Therefore, the responder will accept any x where (1-2*x)/3 >= 0, which simplifies to x <= 0.5. Since x is constrained to be <= 0.5, the responder will always accept any valid offer. To maximize my payoff, I should set x as high as possible within the constraint, which is x = 0.5. This gives me the maximum possible payoff of (1+2*0.5)/3 = 2/3, while the responder gets (1-2*0.5)/3 = 0.
