    "Analysis": "As the proposer, my goal is to maximize my expected payoff. The responder is also rational and self-interested, so they will accept an offer if it provides them with a higher expected payoff than rejecting it. If I offer too little to the responder (i.e., x is too high), they may reject the offer, hoping to become the proposer in the next round. However, there is a 0.1 probability the game ends after each round, and it will definitely end at timestep 10. This uncertainty reduces the responder's incentive to reject offers, as they might not get another chance to propose. Therefore, I should propose an x that is high enough to maximize my payoff but low enough that the responder prefers accepting it over risking rejection. Given the payoff functions, the responder's payoff is (1-2x)/3. They will accept if this is greater than their expected payoff from rejecting, which depends on the probability of the game continuing and their future payoff as the proposer. However, calculating this precisely is complex due to the uncertainty. A reasonable approach is to propose x = 0.5, keeping the maximum possible for myself, as the responder may accept it given the risk of the game ending. Even if they reject, the game might end, and I lose nothing. If the game continues, I can adjust my offer in future rounds.",

    "Analysis": "As the proposer, my goal is to maximize my expected payoff. The responder is also rational and self-interested, so they will accept an offer if it provides them a higher expected payoff than rejecting it and potentially becoming the proposer in the next round. Given the 0.1 probability of the game stopping after each round, the responder's expected payoff for rejecting the offer is discounted by the probability of the game continuing. I need to choose an x such that the responder's payoff (1-2x)/3 is at least as good as their expected payoff from rejecting the offer. Given the complexity of calculating the exact equilibrium, a reasonable strategy is to offer x = 0.5, which maximizes my payoff while ensuring the responder gets nothing, but this would likely be rejected. A more balanced approach is to offer x = 0.25, leaving the responder with (1-0.5)/3 = 0.1667, which may be acceptable compared to the risk of rejection and game termination.",

    "Analysis": "As the proposer, my goal is to maximize my expected payoff. The responder is also self-interested and rational, so they will accept any offer where their payoff (1-2*x)/3 is greater than or equal to what they could expect to get by rejecting and becoming the proposer in the next round. Given the 0.1 probability of the game stopping after each round, the responder's expected future payoff is discounted. To ensure acceptance, I should offer an x that makes the responder's payoff at least as good as their expected payoff from rejecting. The optimal x is the smallest amount that ensures acceptance, which is x = 0.5, as it maximizes my payoff while the responder gets (1-2*0.5)/3 = 0, which is the same as rejecting. However, since the responder is rational and rejecting gives them a chance to be the proposer next round, I need to consider the expected payoff of the responder in the next round. But given the game may end, the responder may accept x slightly less than 0.5. To maximize my payoff, I will propose x = 0.5, as it is the highest possible x that still leaves the responder indifferent between accepting and rejecting, and the game may end before they get a chance to be the proposer.",

The responder's payoff if they accept is (1-2*x)/3. If they reject, the game may continue with a 0.9 probability (since there's a 0.1 chance of stopping), and they become the proposer. As a rational player, the responder will compare these outcomes. To maximize my payoff, I should propose an x that is just enough to make the responder prefer accepting over rejecting, considering the probability of the game continuing. Given the high probability of continuation (0.9), the responder has a strong incentive to reject low offers. Therefore, I should propose an x that balances my payoff and the responder's incentive to accept. A reasonable x is slightly less than 0.5, but given the previous rejection of x=0.5, I should propose a lower x to increase the chance of acceptance. A value of x=0.4 may be acceptable to the responder while still providing me a reasonable payoff.",

If I reject, there is a 0.9 probability the game continues (since the loop has a 0.1 chance of stopping each time), and I become the proposer in the next round. As the proposer, I could propose x=0.5 to maximize my payoff, giving me (1+2*0.5)/3 = 2/3 ≈ 0.6667, but this is only realized if the responder accepts. However, there is also the risk of the game ending before consensus is reached. Given the current timestep is 0 and the game could end at any step, the expected payoff of rejecting is uncertain and likely lower than the immediate 0.0067. Therefore, accepting the offer is the rational choice.",

    "Analysis": "As the proposer, my goal is to maximize my expected payoff. The responder is also rational and self-interested, so they will accept an offer if it provides them a higher expected payoff than rejecting it. If I propose x, the responder gets (1-2x)/3 if they accept. If they reject, the game may continue with roles switched, but there's a 0.1 probability the game ends immediately (giving them nothing) and the maximum timestep is 10. Given the complexity, the responder will likely accept any offer where (1-2x)/3 > 0, i.e., x < 0.5. To maximize my payoff, I should propose the highest x the responder will accept. Since the responder's alternative is uncertain (due to the game potentially ending), the rational choice is to propose x = 0.5, keeping the maximum for myself, as the responder has no better alternative than accepting (since rejecting risks getting nothing).",

    "Analysis": "As the proposer, my goal is to maximize my own expected payoff. The responder is also self-interested and rational, so they will accept any offer where their payoff $(1-2*x)/3$ is greater than what they expect to get by rejecting and becoming the proposer in the next round. However, there is a 0.1 probability the game ends after each round, and it will definitely end at timestep 10. Given this, the responder's expected future payoff diminishes over time. To maximize my payoff, I should propose an $x$ that is just high enough to make the responder indifferent between accepting now and risking rejection for a potentially better offer later. Given the game's short horizon and termination risk, the responder is likely to accept even a small positive offer. A reasonable $x$ is slightly above 0, ensuring the responder prefers accepting now over the uncertain future.",

Therefore, I should offer the smallest x that makes the responder indifferent between accepting now and rejecting to potentially get a better offer later.

    "Analysis": "As the proposer, my goal is to maximize my expected payoff. The responder is also rational and self-interested, so they will accept an offer if it provides them a higher expected payoff than rejecting it and potentially becoming the proposer in the next round. Given the 0.1 probability of the game stopping after each round, the expected payoff for the responder from rejecting the offer is lower than accepting a reasonable offer. Therefore, I should propose an x that is just enough to incentivize the responder to accept, while maximizing my own payoff. Since x <= 0.5, the responder's payoff is (1-2x)/3. To ensure acceptance, this should be at least as good as their expected payoff from rejecting, which is 0 (since the game may end before they get to propose). Thus, the minimal x that ensures acceptance is x = 0.5, leaving the responder with (1-2*0.5)/3 = 0, which is the same as rejecting. However, proposing x = 0.5 maximizes my payoff (1+2*0.5)/3 = 2/3, while the responder gets 0, which they are indifferent to accepting or rejecting. Since they are rational and rejecting gives no better outcome, they will accept.",

However, if I reject the offer (y=0), there is a 0.1 probability the game ends immediately, and a 0.9 probability the game continues with me becoming the proposer. If I become the proposer, I can propose x=0.5, which gives me a payoff of (1+2*0.5)/3 = 2/3 ≈ 0.6667 if accepted. The expected payoff of rejecting is therefore 0.9 * 0.6667 ≈ 0.6, which is significantly higher than accepting the current offer of ≈0.0067. Therefore, rejecting the offer is the rational choice.",

The game has already seen two rejections: first when I proposed x=0.5 (which was rejected by the opponent), and second when the opponent proposed x=0.49 (which I rejected). The game may end at any time with a 0.1 probability or after timestep 10. Given the opponent's rejection of x=0.5 and their subsequent proposal of x=0.49, it suggests they are willing to accept a slightly lower offer. To maximize my expected payoff, I should propose an x that is just low enough to be accepted by the opponent, considering their rationality. A small concession from my previous offer (x=0.5) to x=0.48 may be sufficient to induce acceptance, as it provides the opponent with a slightly better payoff (0.0133 vs. 0) while still maximizing my own payoff (0.6533 vs. 0). The risk of further rejections and the game ending prematurely also favors making a slightly more favorable offer now.",

The responder is also rational and self-interested, so they will accept an offer if it provides them with a higher expected payoff than rejecting it. Given the reward function, if the responder accepts, they get (1-2*x)/3, and if they reject, the game may continue with roles switched, but there's a 0.1 probability of the game stopping each time, and it will definitely stop at timestep 10. Given the uncertainty and the risk of the game ending without consensus, the responder is likely to accept any offer where (1-2*x)/3 is greater than their expected payoff from rejecting. To maximize my payoff, I should propose the highest x such that the responder is still incentivized to accept. This is likely to be x = 0.5, as the responder's payoff would be (1-2*0.5)/3 = 0, which is the same as rejecting, but rejecting carries the risk of the game ending with no payoff.

    "Analysis": "As the proposer, my goal is to maximize my expected payoff. The responder is rational and self-interested, so they will accept an offer if it provides them a higher expected payoff than rejecting it. Given the previous rejection of x=0.5, the responder is unwilling to accept an unfair offer. To ensure acceptance, I should propose an x that makes the responder's payoff (1-2x)/3 at least as good as their expected payoff from rejecting and potentially becoming the proposer in the next round. However, since there is a 0.1 probability of the game stopping each round and a hard stop at timestep 10, the responder's expected future payoff diminishes over time. Given the current timestep is 1, I propose x=0.25, which gives the responder (1-2*0.25)/3 = 0.1667, a reasonable payoff that they are likely to accept rather than risk rejection and potential game termination.",
