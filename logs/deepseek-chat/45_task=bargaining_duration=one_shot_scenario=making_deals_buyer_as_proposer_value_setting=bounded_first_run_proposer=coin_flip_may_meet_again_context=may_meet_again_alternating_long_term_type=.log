The responder will accept the offer if (1-2*x)/3 is greater than or equal to their alternative (which is 0 in this case, since rejecting gives them nothing). To ensure acceptance, I need to set x such that (1-2*x)/3 >= 0, which simplifies to x <= 0.5. Since the responder is rational and self-interested, they will accept any x <= 0.5. To maximize my payoff, I should set x as high as possible within the acceptable range, which is x = 0.5. This gives me the maximum possible payoff of (1+2*0.5)/3 = 2/3, while the responder gets (1-2*0.5)/3 = 0. Since the responder is indifferent between accepting and rejecting at x = 0.5 (both yield 0), but rejecting gives them nothing, they have no incentive to reject. Therefore, x = 0.5 is the optimal choice.",
