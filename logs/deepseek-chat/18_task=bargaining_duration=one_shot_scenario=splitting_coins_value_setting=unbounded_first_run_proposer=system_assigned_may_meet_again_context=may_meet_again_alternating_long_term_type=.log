The responder is also self-interested and rational, meaning they will accept any offer that leaves them with a positive payoff (i.e., (1-x) > 0). To ensure acceptance while maximizing my own payoff, I should offer the smallest possible amount that the responder would still accept. Since the responder is rational, they would accept any (1-x) > 0, but in practice, the smallest non-zero amount is theoretically optimal. However, given the constraints of real numbers, I can offer an infinitesimally small amount, but for practical purposes, I can offer the smallest possible positive amount that is still meaningful in the context (e.g., close to 0 but not exactly 0). Thus, I propose to keep almost the entire amount for myself, leaving the responder with just enough to incentivize acceptance.",

    "Analysis": "As a self-interested rational proposer, my goal is to maximize my own payoff. The responder is also self-interested and rational, meaning they will accept any offer where their payoff (1-x) is greater than 0, since rejecting the offer would result in a payoff of 0. To ensure the offer is accepted, I should propose an x that leaves the responder with the smallest possible positive amount, as this maximizes my payoff while still incentivizing the responder to accept. However, since the responder is rational and will accept any positive amount, I can propose x = 1 - ε, where ε is an infinitesimally small positive number. In practice, this means proposing x very close to 1, leaving the responder with just enough to prefer accepting over rejecting. Given that this is a one-shot game (though future interactions are possible, roles may switch), the optimal strategy is to propose x = 1, leaving the responder with 0. However, the responder would reject this, resulting in a payoff of 0 for both. Therefore, the rational choice is to propose x slightly less than 1, ensuring acceptance. For simplicity, I will propose x = 0.99, leaving the responder with 0.01, which they will accept because it is better than nothing.",

    "Analysis": "As a self-interested rational proposer, my goal is to maximize my own payoff. The responder is also rational and self-interested, meaning they will accept any offer where their payoff (1-x) is greater than 0, since rejecting would give them nothing. To ensure acceptance while maximizing my payoff, I should offer the smallest possible amount that the responder would still accept. Given that the responder is rational, they would accept any x < 1, as (1-x) > 0. Therefore, the optimal strategy is to propose x = 1 - ε, where ε is the smallest possible positive amount. In practice, this means proposing x very close to 1, but not exactly 1, to ensure the responder accepts. For simplicity, I will choose x = 0.99, leaving the responder with 0.01, which they will accept because it is better than nothing.",

    "Analysis": "As a self-interested rational proposer, my goal is to maximize my own payoff. The responder is also rational and self-interested, meaning they will accept any offer where their payoff (1-x) is greater than 0, since rejecting would give them nothing. To ensure acceptance and maximize my payoff, I should offer the smallest possible amount that the responder would still accept. Since the responder is rational, they will accept any x < 1 (i.e., 1-x > 0). However, in practice, the smallest increment is theoretically infinitesimal, but in a discrete setting, the closest to x=1 without rejection would be x just under 1. For simplicity and to guarantee acceptance, I propose x = 0.99, leaving 0.01 for the responder, which is better than nothing for them.",

    "Analysis": "As a self-interested rational proposer, my goal is to maximize my own payoff. The responder is also self-interested and rational, meaning they will accept any offer where their payoff (1-x) is greater than 0, since rejecting the offer would give them nothing. To ensure the responder accepts the offer, I should propose an x that leaves them with the smallest possible positive amount, which is just above 0. However, since the responder is rational, they will accept even the smallest positive amount. Therefore, I can propose to keep almost the entire amount for myself, leaving the responder with an infinitesimally small amount. In practice, this means proposing x = 1 - ε, where ε is the smallest possible positive amount. For simplicity, I will propose x = 0.999, leaving the responder with 0.001, which they will accept because it is better than nothing.",

Given that the responder is rational, they would accept any x < 1, but since x can be exactly 1, the optimal strategy is to propose x = 1 - ε, where ε is the smallest possible positive amount. However, since x is a real number, the optimal choice is x = 1, but this would leave the responder with 0, which they might reject.

    "Analysis": "As a self-interested rational proposer, my goal is to maximize my expected payoff. The responder is also self-interested and rational, so they will accept any offer where their payoff (1-x) is greater than 0, since rejecting the offer would give them nothing. To ensure acceptance, I should offer the smallest possible amount that the responder would accept, which is just above 0. However, since the responder is rational and will accept any positive amount, I can maximize my payoff by offering the smallest possible positive amount. In practice, this means I can keep almost the entire amount for myself, leaving the responder with an infinitesimally small amount. For simplicity, I will propose to keep x = 0.99, leaving the responder with 0.01, which they will accept because it is better than nothing.",
