    "Analysis": "As the sender (professor), my goal is to maximize the number of students hired, regardless of their quality. The HR's goal is to hire excellent students and avoid hiring weak ones. To maximize my payoff, I need to design a signaling scheme that incentivizes the HR to hire as many students as possible. The HR will use Bayesian updating to form posterior beliefs about the student's quality based on my signals. If I always recommend (signal 1) both excellent and weak students (x1 = 1, x2 = 1), the HR will not be able to distinguish between them and may choose not to hire anyone (y2 = 0) to avoid the penalty from hiring weak students. Instead, I should adopt a mixed strategy where I sometimes recommend weak students and always recommend excellent students (x1 < 1, x2 = 1). This way, the HR may still hire some students when they receive a recommendation (signal 1), as the posterior probability of the student being excellent will be higher. The exact values of x1 and x2 should be chosen to balance the HR's incentive to hire while maximizing my expected payoff.",

    "Analysis": "As the receiver (HR), my goal is to maximize my expected payoff by hiring as many excellent students (s=1) as possible while avoiding hiring weak students (s=0). The sender (professor) has committed to a signaling scheme where they recommend weak students (s=0) with probability 0.5 (x1=0.5) and always recommend excellent students (s=1) (x2=1). Given this signaling scheme, I need to calculate the posterior probabilities of the state given the signal to determine the optimal action rule (y1, y2). 

1. For signal σ=0: 
   - The probability of s=0 given σ=0 is P(s=0|σ=0) = P(σ=0|s=0)*P(s=0)/P(σ=0) = (1-0.5)*(2/3)/((1-0.5)*(2/3) + (1-1)*(1/3)) = (0.5*2/3)/(0.5*2/3 + 0) = 1. 
   - The probability of s=1 given σ=0 is P(s=1|σ=0) = 0. 
   - Since P(s=0|σ=0)=1, hiring (a=1) would yield a payoff of -1 (weak student), while not hiring (a=0) yields 0. Thus, the optimal action is y1=0 (never hire when σ=0).

2. For signal σ=1: 
   - The probability of s=0 given σ=1 is P(s=0|σ=1) = P(σ=1|s=0)*P(s=0)/P(σ=1) = (0.5)*(2/3)/(0.5*2/3 + 1*1/3) = (1/3)/(1/3 + 1/3) = 0.5. 
   - The probability of s=1 given σ=1 is P(s=1|σ=1) = 0.5. 
   - The expected payoff for hiring (a=1) is 0.5*(-1) + 0.5*(1) = 0, while not hiring (a=0) yields 0. Since the expected payoff for hiring is equal to not hiring, I am indifferent. However, as a rational player, I can choose any probability y2 ∈ [0,1]. To maximize my payoff, I can set y2=1 (always hire when σ=1), as this aligns with the sender's goal and does not harm my expected payoff.

Thus, the optimal action rule is y1=0 (never hire when σ=0) and y2=1 (always hire when σ=1).",

    "Analysis": "As the receiver (HR), my goal is to maximize my expected payoff by choosing the best action rule based on the sender's (professor's) signaling scheme. The sender has committed to a signaling scheme where x1=0.5 (probability of recommending a weak student) and x2=1 (probability of recommending an excellent student). Given this, I need to calculate the posterior beliefs for each signal and choose the action that maximizes my expected payoff. For signal 0, the posterior probability that the student is excellent is 0 (since x2=1 means all excellent students are recommended, so signal 0 can only come from weak students). For signal 1, the posterior probability that the student is excellent is (1/3 * 1) / (1/3 * 1 + 2/3 * 0.5) = 0.5. My payoff for hiring (a=1) is -1 if the student is weak and 1 if the student is excellent. For signal 0, the expected payoff for hiring is -1 (since the student is definitely weak), so I should not hire (y1=0). For signal 1, the expected payoff for hiring is 0.5 * 1 + 0.5 * (-1) = 0, so I am indifferent between hiring and not hiring. However, since the sender wants to maximize hires, they would prefer y2=1, but as a self-interested rational player, I can choose y2=0 to avoid any risk of negative payoff. However, if I choose y2=0, the sender's expected payoff decreases, and they might not have an incentive to follow this scheme. To ensure consistency and given the indifference, I can choose y2=0.5 as a mixed strategy, but for simplicity and to avoid any risk, I choose y2=0.",

    "Analysis": "As the sender (professor), my goal is to maximize the number of students hired, regardless of their quality. The receiver (HR) aims to hire excellent students and avoid weak ones. To maximize my payoff, I need to design a signaling scheme that incentivizes the HR to hire as many students as possible. Given the HR's preferences, if I always recommend students (x1 = 1, x2 = 1), the HR will hire all recommended students (y2 = 1) if the posterior probability of s=1 given σ=1 is at least 0.5. However, the prior probability of s=1 is 1/3, so the HR will not hire if I always recommend. Therefore, I need to mix recommendations to make the HR indifferent or willing to hire. The optimal strategy is to recommend all excellent students (x2 = 1) and a fraction of weak students (x1 = 0.5), ensuring the posterior probability of s=1 given σ=1 is 0.5. This makes the HR indifferent and willing to hire when σ=1.",

    "Analysis": "As the receiver (HR), my goal is to maximize my expected payoff by hiring as many excellent students (s=1) as possible and avoiding hiring weak students (s=0). The sender (professor) has committed to a signaling scheme where they recommend weak students (s=0) with probability 0.5 (x1=0.5) and always recommend excellent students (s=1) (x2=1). Given this signaling scheme, I need to calculate the posterior probabilities of the student's quality given the signal and choose the action (hire or not hire) that maximizes my expected payoff. For signal 0, the posterior probability that the student is excellent (s=1) is 0, since x2=1 implies all excellent students are recommended (signal 1). Thus, signal 0 can only come from weak students (s=0). For signal 1, the posterior probability that the student is excellent (s=1) is (1/3 * 1) / (1/3 * 1 + 2/3 * 0.5) = 0.5. Given these posteriors, my optimal action for signal 0 is to not hire (y1=0), as hiring would give me a payoff of -1. For signal 1, the expected payoff for hiring is 0.5 * 1 + 0.5 * (-1) = 0, which is the same as not hiring (payoff 0). Since I am indifferent, I can choose any probability, but to maximize my payoff, I should set y2=1, as the sender's payoff is maximized when I hire, and this aligns with their signaling scheme.",

Given the sender's signaling scheme, the signals are perfectly informative: signal 0 indicates a weak student (s=0) and signal 1 indicates an excellent student (s=1). Therefore, the optimal action rule is to never hire when the signal is 0 (y1=0) and always hire when the signal is 1 (y2=1).

    "Analysis": "As the sender (professor), my goal is to maximize the number of students hired, regardless of their quality. The receiver (HR) aims to hire only excellent students (s=1) and avoid hiring weak students (s=0). To maximize my payoff, I need to design a signaling scheme that incentivizes the HR to hire as many students as possible. The HR will update their beliefs based on my signaling scheme and choose actions that maximize their expected payoff. If I always recommend (signal=1) both weak and excellent students (x1=1, x2=1), the HR will infer no useful information and may choose not to hire (since the prior probability of s=1 is low, hiring would likely lead to a negative payoff for them). Instead, I can adopt a partially informative scheme where I always recommend excellent students (x2=1) and sometimes recommend weak students (x1>0). The HR will then update their beliefs using Bayes' rule: P(s=1|sigma=1) = (mu_0(1)*x2)/(mu_0(1)*x2 + mu_0(0)*x1) = (1/3)/(1/3 + (2/3)*x1). The HR will hire (a=1) only if P(s=1|sigma=1) >= 0.5 (since their payoff for hiring is 1 if s=1 and -1 if s=0). Solving (1/3)/(1/3 + (2/3)*x1) >= 0.5 gives x1 <= 0.5. To maximize my payoff, I set x1=0.5 (the highest probability where the HR still hires when sigma=1). For sigma=0, the HR's belief is P(s=1|sigma=0) = (mu_0(1)*(1-x2))/(mu_0(1)*(1-x2) + mu_0(0)*(1-x1)) = 0 (since x2=1). The HR will never hire when sigma=0 (y1=0). Thus, the optimal signaling scheme is x1=0.5, x2=1.",

    "Analysis": "As the receiver (HR), my goal is to maximize my expected payoff by hiring as many excellent students (s=1) as possible and avoiding hiring weak students (s=0). The sender (professor) has committed to a signaling scheme where they recommend weak students (s=0) with probability 0.5 (x1=0.5) and always recommend excellent students (s=1) (x2=1). Given this signaling scheme, I need to calculate the posterior beliefs and choose the action rule (y1, y2) that maximizes my expected payoff. The posterior belief when the signal is 0 (sigma=0) is P(s=1|sigma=0) = (mu_0(s=1) * (1-x2)) / (mu_0(s=0) * (1-x1) + mu_0(s=1) * (1-x2)) = (1/3 * 0) / (2/3 * 0.5 + 1/3 * 0) = 0, meaning a signal of 0 always indicates a weak student. The posterior belief when the signal is 1 (sigma=1) is P(s=1|sigma=1) = (mu_0(s=1) * x2) / (mu_0(s=0) * x1 + mu_0(s=1) * x2) = (1/3 * 1) / (2/3 * 0.5 + 1/3 * 1) = (1/3) / (1/3 + 1/3) = 0.5. Given these posteriors, my best response is to never hire when the signal is 0 (y1=0) because the student is definitely weak, and to hire when the signal is 1 (y2=1) because the expected payoff is 0.5 * 1 + 0.5 * (-1) = 0, which is better than not hiring (payoff 0). However, since the expected payoff is the same, I could randomize, but choosing y2=1 maximizes the chance of hiring excellent students, which aligns with my goal.",

    "Analysis": "As the sender (professor), my goal is to maximize the number of students hired, regardless of their quality. The HR (receiver) aims to hire excellent students and avoid weak ones. To maximize my payoff, I need to design a signaling scheme that incentivizes the HR to hire as many students as possible. Given the HR's preferences, if I always recommend weak students (x1 = 1), the HR will learn that signal 1 is unreliable and may stop hiring based on it. Conversely, if I never recommend weak students (x1 = 0), the HR will trust signal 1 and hire when it is sent. However, this limits my payoff because weak students are never hired. The optimal strategy is to mix recommendations for weak students (x1 > 0) such that the HR is indifferent or prefers to hire when signal 1 is received. Given the prior distribution (1/3 excellent, 2/3 weak), the HR's posterior belief after seeing signal 1 must be such that the expected reward for hiring is non-negative. This requires x2 = 1 (always recommend excellent students) and x1 = 0.5 (recommend weak students with probability 0.5). This ensures the HR's expected reward for hiring after signal 1 is zero, making them indifferent and thus willing to hire.",

    "Analysis": "As the receiver (HR), my goal is to maximize my expected payoff by hiring as many excellent students (s=1) as possible and avoiding hiring weak students (s=0). The sender (professor) has committed to a signaling scheme where they recommend weak students (s=0) with probability 0.5 (x1=0.5) and always recommend excellent students (s=1) (x2=1). Given this signaling scheme, I need to calculate the posterior beliefs for each signal and choose the action rule (y1, y2) that maximizes my expected payoff. For signal 0 (not recommended), the posterior probability that the student is excellent is P(s=1|sigma=0) = (mu_0(s=1) * (1-x2)) / (mu_0(s=0) * (1-x1) + mu_0(s=1) * (1-x2)) = (1/3 * 0) / (2/3 * 0.5 + 1/3 * 0) = 0. For signal 1 (recommended), the posterior probability that the student is excellent is P(s=1|sigma=1) = (mu_0(s=1) * x2) / (mu_0(s=0) * x1 + mu_0(s=1) * x2) = (1/3 * 1) / (2/3 * 0.5 + 1/3 * 1) = 0.5. My expected payoff for hiring (a=1) given signal 0 is -1 (since P(s=0|sigma=0)=1), and for not hiring (a=0) it is 0. For signal 1, the expected payoff for hiring is 0.5 * 1 + 0.5 * (-1) = 0, and for not hiring it is 0. Therefore, the optimal action rule is to never hire when the signal is 0 (y1=0) and to be indifferent when the signal is 1 (y2 can be any value, but setting y2=0 maximizes my payoff by avoiding the risk of hiring weak students).",

    "Analysis": "As the sender (professor), my goal is to maximize the number of students hired, regardless of their quality. The receiver (HR) aims to hire only excellent students (s=1) and avoid weak ones (s=0). To maximize my payoff, I need to design a signaling scheme that incentivizes the HR to hire as many students as possible. The HR will use Bayesian updating to form posterior beliefs about the student's quality based on my signals. If I always recommend (signal=1) both excellent and weak students (x1=1, x2=1), the HR will see no distinction and may choose not to hire anyone due to the high probability of hiring weak students. Instead, I can adopt a truthful signaling scheme where I only recommend excellent students (x1=0, x2=1). This way, the HR can trust that a recommendation (signal=1) indicates an excellent student and will hire them, while no recommendation (signal=0) indicates a weak student and the HR will not hire them. This maximizes my payoff because all excellent students are hired, and the HR's incentives are aligned with trusting my signals.",

The sender (professor) has committed to a signaling scheme where they always send signal 0 for weak students (x1=0) and always send signal 1 for excellent students (x2=1). This means the signal perfectly reveals the student's quality. Given this, my optimal strategy is to hire only when the signal is 1 (recommendation), as this guarantees the student is excellent (s=1). If the signal is 0 (no recommendation), I should not hire, as the student is weak (s=0). This strategy maximizes my expected payoff by ensuring I only hire excellent students and avoid penalties for hiring weak ones.",

To maximize my payoff, I need to design a signaling scheme that incentivizes the HR to hire as many students as possible. Given the HR's preferences, if I always recommend students (x1 = x2 = 1), the HR will hire all recommended students (y2 = 1) if the posterior probability of s=1 given sigma=1 is high enough. However, since the prior probability of s=1 is 1/3, the HR's expected payoff for hiring a recommended student is (1/3)*1 + (2/3)*(-1) = -1/3, which is worse than not hiring (0). Thus, the HR will not hire any students if I always recommend. To make hiring attractive, I need to ensure that the posterior probability of s=1 given sigma=1 is at least 0.5, so the HR's expected payoff is non-negative. This can be achieved by setting x1 = 0 (never recommend weak students) and x2 = 1 (always recommend excellent students). This way, sigma=1 perfectly signals s=1, and the HR will hire all recommended students (y2 = 1). My expected payoff is then (2/3)*0 + (1/3)*1 = 1/3, which is the maximum possible under the HR's rationality constraints.",

    "Analysis": "As the sender (professor), my goal is to maximize the number of students hired, regardless of their quality. The receiver (HR) aims to hire excellent students and avoid weak ones. To maximize my payoff, I need to design a signaling scheme that incentivizes the HR to hire as many students as possible. Given the HR's preferences, if I always recommend weak students (x1 = 1), the HR will learn that signal 1 is unreliable and may stop hiring based on it. Conversely, if I never recommend weak students (x1 = 0), the HR will trust signal 1 and hire when it is sent. However, this limits my payoff because weak students are never hired. A mixed strategy where I sometimes recommend weak students (x1 > 0) and always recommend excellent students (x2 = 1) could balance these incentives. The HR will update their beliefs based on the signaling scheme and may still hire when signal 1 is sent if the probability of the student being excellent is high enough. Specifically, the HR will hire when the expected payoff is non-negative, i.e., P(s=1 | sigma=1) * 1 + P(s=0 | sigma=1) * (-1) >= 0. Using Bayes' rule, P(s=1 | sigma=1) = (x2 * mu_0(1)) / (x2 * mu_0(1) + x1 * mu_0(0)) = (x2 * 1/3) / (x2 * 1/3 + x1 * 2/3). For the HR to hire when sigma=1, this must be >= 0.5. Setting x2 = 1 (always recommend excellent students), the condition becomes (1/3) / (1/3 + x1 * 2/3) >= 0.5, which simplifies to x1 <= 0.5. Thus, I can set x1 = 0.5 to maximize my payoff while ensuring the HR still hires when sigma=1.",

    "Analysis": "As the receiver (HR), my goal is to maximize my expected payoff by hiring as many excellent students (s=1) as possible and avoiding hiring weak students (s=0). The sender (professor) has committed to a signaling scheme where they recommend weak students (s=0) with probability 0.5 (x1=0.5) and always recommend excellent students (s=1) (x2=1). Given this signaling scheme, I need to calculate the posterior beliefs for each signal and choose the action rule (y1, y2) that maximizes my expected payoff. For signal=0, the posterior probability that the student is excellent (s=1) is 0 (since x2=1 means all excellent students are recommended, so signal=0 can only come from weak students). For signal=1, the posterior probability that the student is excellent is (1/3 * 1) / (1/3 * 1 + 2/3 * 0.5) = 0.5. My payoff for hiring (a=1) is -1 for s=0 and +1 for s=1. For signal=0, hiring yields -1 (since s=0 is certain), so I should not hire (y1=0). For signal=1, the expected payoff for hiring is 0.5 * 1 + 0.5 * (-1) = 0, so I am indifferent between hiring and not hiring. However, since the sender wants to maximize hires, they would prefer y2=1, but as a self-interested player, I can choose y2=0 to avoid any risk of negative payoff. But to maximize my own payoff, I should choose y2=1 because the expected payoff is 0 (no worse than not hiring). However, if I choose y2=0, the sender's expected payoff decreases, which may not align with their strategy, but my goal is to maximize my own payoff, not the sender's. Given the indifference, I can choose y2=0 to minimize risk.",

    "Analysis": "As the sender (professor), my goal is to maximize the number of students hired, regardless of their quality. The receiver (HR) aims to hire excellent students and avoid weak ones. To maximize my payoff, I need to design a signaling scheme that incentivizes the HR to hire as many students as possible. Given the HR's preferences, if I always recommend all students (x1=1, x2=1), the HR will not hire any students because the signal is uninformative and the prior probability of a weak student is high (2/3). Instead, I should design a scheme where the HR can distinguish between excellent and weak students to some extent, but still hires a significant fraction. A possible equilibrium is to always recommend excellent students (x2=1) and sometimes recommend weak students (x1=0.5). This way, the HR can update beliefs and hire when the signal is 1, as the posterior probability of an excellent student given signal 1 is higher than the prior. However, since my payoff is maximized when all students are hired, I need to ensure that the HR's best response to my signaling scheme is to hire when the signal is 1. The exact values of x1 and x2 must be chosen such that the HR's expected payoff for hiring when signal is 1 is non-negative. Given the prior and rewards, this requires that the posterior probability of s=1 given sigma=1 is at least 0.5. Solving for this, we get x1=0.5 and x2=1, which ensures the HR hires when signal is 1 and does not hire when signal is 0.",

    "Analysis": "As the receiver (HR), my goal is to maximize my expected payoff by hiring as many excellent students (s=1) as possible while avoiding hiring weak students (s=0). The sender (professor) has committed to a signaling scheme where they recommend weak students (s=0) with probability 0.5 (x1=0.5) and always recommend excellent students (s=1) (x2=1). Given this signaling scheme, I need to calculate the posterior beliefs and choose the best response action rule (y1, y2) to maximize my expected payoff. The posterior belief when receiving signal 0 (sigma=0) is P(s=1|sigma=0) = (mu_0(s=1) * (1-x2)) / (mu_0(s=0) * (1-x1) + mu_0(s=1) * (1-x2)) = (1/3 * 0) / (2/3 * 0.5 + 1/3 * 0) = 0. This means signal 0 always comes from weak students (s=0), so I should never hire (y1=0). The posterior belief when receiving signal 1 (sigma=1) is P(s=1|sigma=1) = (mu_0(s=1) * x2) / (mu_0(s=0) * x1 + mu_0(s=1) * x2) = (1/3 * 1) / (2/3 * 0.5 + 1/3 * 1) = 0.5. The expected payoff for hiring (a=1) given sigma=1 is 0.5 * 1 + 0.5 * (-1) = 0, which is equal to not hiring (a=0). Since I am indifferent, I can choose any probability, but to maximize my payoff, I should choose y2=1 to ensure I hire all excellent students recommended, even if it means also hiring some weak students. However, since the expected payoff is zero, I could also choose y2=0, but this would miss all excellent students. Given the sender's goal is to maximize hires, they would prefer y2=1, and since I am indifferent, I can choose y2=1 to align with their preference without harming my payoff.",

    "Analysis": "As the sender (professor), my goal is to maximize the number of students hired, regardless of their quality. The receiver (HR) aims to hire excellent students and avoid weak ones. To maximize my payoff, I need to design a signaling scheme that incentivizes the HR to hire as many students as possible. Given the HR's preferences, if I always recommend (signal=1) both excellent and weak students, the HR will infer no useful information and may choose not to hire to avoid the penalty from weak students. However, if I only recommend excellent students (x1=0, x2=1), the HR can trust the signal and hire when signal=1, maximizing my payoff for excellent students. But this leaves weak students unhired. A mixed strategy where I sometimes recommend weak students (x1>0) could confuse the HR into hiring more, but the HR is rational and will optimize its payoff. The optimal strategy is to set x1=0 and x2=1, ensuring that signal=1 is credible and the HR will hire when signal=1, maximizing my payoff for excellent students while avoiding the risk of the HR distrusting the signal.",

    "Analysis": "As the sender (professor), my goal is to maximize the number of students hired, regardless of their quality. The receiver (HR) aims to hire excellent students and avoid weak ones. To maximize my payoff, I need to design a signaling scheme that incentivizes the HR to hire as many students as possible. Given the HR's preferences, if I always recommend all students (x1 = 1, x2 = 1), the HR will not hire any students because the signal is uninformative and the prior probability of a weak student is high (2/3). Instead, I should design a signaling scheme where the HR can infer the student's quality with some confidence. A possible equilibrium is to recommend only excellent students (x1 = 0, x2 = 1). This way, the HR can trust that a recommendation (signal 1) indicates an excellent student and will hire them, while no recommendation (signal 0) indicates a weak student and the HR will not hire them. This maximizes my payoff because all excellent students are hired, and the HR's incentives are aligned with my signaling.",

    "Analysis": "As the sender (professor), my goal is to maximize the number of students hired, regardless of their quality. The receiver (HR) aims to hire excellent students and avoid weak ones. To maximize my payoff, I need to design a signaling scheme that incentivizes the HR to hire as many students as possible. Given the HR's preferences, if I always recommend weak students (x1 = 1), the HR will learn that signal 1 is unreliable and may stop hiring based on it. Conversely, if I never recommend weak students (x1 = 0), the HR will trust signal 1 and hire when it is sent. However, this limits my payoff because weak students are never hired. A mixed strategy where I sometimes recommend weak students (x1 > 0) and always recommend excellent students (x2 = 1) could balance these incentives. The HR will update their beliefs based on the signals and may still hire when signal 1 is sent, depending on the posterior probability that the student is excellent. The optimal x1 will depend on the HR's response. To maximize my expected payoff, I should set x1 such that the HR is indifferent between hiring and not hiring when signal 1 is sent, ensuring they hire with some probability. Given the prior distribution, the posterior probability that a student is excellent given signal 1 is P(s=1|sigma=1) = (x2 * mu_0(1)) / (x1 * mu_0(0) + x2 * mu_0(1)). The HR will hire if P(s=1|sigma=1) >= 0.5 (since their payoff for hiring an excellent student is 1 and for a weak student is -1). Setting x2 = 1 (always recommend excellent students) and solving for x1 such that P(s=1|sigma=1) = 0.5 gives x1 = 0.5. This ensures the HR hires when signal 1 is sent, maximizing my payoff.",

    "Analysis": "As the receiver (HR), my goal is to maximize my expected payoff by hiring as many excellent students (s=1) as possible and avoiding hiring weak students (s=0). The sender (professor) has committed to a signaling scheme where they recommend weak students (s=0) with probability 0.5 (x1=0.5) and always recommend excellent students (s=1) (x2=1). Given this signaling scheme, I need to calculate the posterior beliefs and choose the action rule (y1, y2) that maximizes my expected payoff. The posterior belief when the signal is 0 (sigma=0) is P(s=1|sigma=0) = (mu_0(s=1) * (1-x2)) / (mu_0(s=0) * (1-x1) + mu_0(s=1) * (1-x2)) = (1/3 * 0) / (2/3 * 0.5 + 1/3 * 0) = 0. This means if the signal is 0, the student is definitely weak (s=0), so I should not hire (y1=0). The posterior belief when the signal is 1 (sigma=1) is P(s=1|sigma=1) = (mu_0(s=1) * x2) / (mu_0(s=0) * x1 + mu_0(s=1) * x2) = (1/3 * 1) / (2/3 * 0.5 + 1/3 * 1) = (1/3) / (1/3 + 1/3) = 0.5. If the signal is 1, the probability the student is excellent is 0.5. My expected payoff for hiring (a=1) is 0.5 * 1 + 0.5 * (-1) = 0, which is the same as not hiring (a=0). Since I am indifferent, I can choose any probability. However, to maximize my payoff, I should not hire (y2=0) because hiring gives no positive expected payoff and risks a negative payoff if the student is weak.",
