The responder is also self-interested and rational, meaning they will accept any offer where their payoff (1 - x) is greater than 0, since rejecting would give them 0. To ensure acceptance and maximize my payoff, I should offer the smallest possible amount that the responder would still accept. Since the responder is rational, they will accept any x < 1 (i.e., 1 - x > 0). However, if x = 1, the responder gets 0 and would be indifferent between accepting or rejecting. To avoid any risk of rejection, I should choose x infinitesimally less than 1, but in practice, x = 1 is the limit.

The responder is also self-interested and rational, meaning they will accept any offer where their payoff (1 - x) is greater than 0, since rejecting would give them 0.

Since the responder would accept any (1 - x) > 0, the optimal strategy is to offer x = 1 - ε, where ε is an infinitesimally small positive number. In practice, this means offering x = 1, leaving nothing for the responder. However, since the responder would reject x = 1 (as 1 - x = 0), the equilibrium is to offer x just slightly less than 1, ensuring the responder accepts. For simplicity, we can model this as x = 1, but in reality, the exact value would depend on the smallest divisible unit (if any). Given the continuous nature of x, the optimal offer is x = 1.",

    "Analysis": "As a self-interested rational proposer, my goal is to maximize my own payoff. The responder is also self-interested and rational, meaning they will accept any offer where their payoff (1-x) is greater than 0, since rejecting it would result in a payoff of 0. The smallest positive amount the responder would accept is infinitesimally close to 0. Therefore, to maximize my payoff, I should offer the responder the smallest possible amount they would still accept, which is just above 0. In practice, this means offering x = 1 - ε, where ε is an arbitrarily small positive number. However, since the problem allows for real numbers, the optimal decision is x = 1, but this would leave the responder with 0, which they would reject. Thus, the equilibrium strategy is to offer x = 1 - ε, where ε is the smallest amount that ensures the responder's payoff is just above 0. For simplicity, we can approximate this as x = 1 (but in reality, it would be slightly less to ensure acceptance). Given the constraints, the optimal decision is to offer x = 1 - ε ≈ 1, but since ε can be arbitrarily small, the decision is effectively x = 1.",

    "Analysis": "As a self-interested rational proposer, my goal is to maximize my own payoff. The responder is also self-interested and rational, meaning they will accept any offer where their payoff (1 - x) is greater than 0, since rejecting the offer would give them nothing. To ensure the responder accepts the offer, I should propose an x such that (1 - x) is just slightly greater than 0. The optimal strategy is to propose x = 1 - ε, where ε is an infinitesimally small positive number. In practice, since x must be a real number in [0, 1], the optimal choice is x = 1, but this would leave the responder with 0, which they would reject. Therefore, the rational choice is to propose x = 0.999..., effectively maximizing my payoff while ensuring the responder accepts the offer.",

The responder is also self-interested and rational, meaning they will accept any offer where their payoff (1 - x) is greater than 0, since rejecting would give them 0. To ensure the offer is accepted, I should propose the smallest possible x that leaves the responder indifferent between accepting and rejecting. Since the responder will accept any (1 - x) > 0, the optimal strategy is to propose x = 1 - ε, where ε is an infinitesimally small positive number. In practice, this means proposing x = 1, but since x must be <= 1, the rational choice is x = 1, leaving the responder with 0. The responder, being rational, would accept this because rejecting would also give them 0, and accepting is weakly better.",

    "Analysis": "As a self-interested rational proposer, my goal is to maximize my own payoff. The responder is also self-interested and rational, meaning they will accept any offer where their payoff (1 - x) is greater than 0, since rejecting the offer would result in a payoff of 0. To ensure the responder accepts the offer, I should propose an x such that (1 - x) is just slightly greater than 0. The optimal strategy is to propose x = 1 - ε, where ε is an infinitesimally small positive number. In practice, this means proposing x = 1, but since x must be <= 1, the rational choice is to propose x as close to 1 as possible while still ensuring the responder accepts. Given the responder's rationality, the minimal acceptable (1 - x) is any positive amount, so x can be arbitrarily close to 1. For simplicity, I will propose x = 0.999, which leaves the responder with 0.001, a positive amount they will accept.",

    "Analysis": "As a self-interested rational proposer, my goal is to maximize my own payoff. The responder is also self-interested and rational, meaning they will accept any offer where their payoff (1 - x) is greater than 0, since rejecting the offer would give them nothing. Therefore, the optimal strategy is to offer the smallest possible amount that the responder would still accept, which is an infinitesimally small amount above 0. In practice, this means offering x = 1 - ε, where ε is a very small positive number. However, since x must be a real number between 0 and 1, the most rational choice is to offer x = 1 (keeping everything for myself), knowing that the responder would reject it, but there is no better alternative that the responder would accept while leaving me with a higher payoff. But this would result in both getting nothing. Therefore, the correct rational choice is to offer x just slightly less than 1, ensuring the responder gets an infinitesimal amount (1 - x) > 0, which they would accept. For simplicity, we can approximate this as x = 0.999.",

The responder is also self-interested and rational, meaning they will accept any offer where their payoff (1-x) is greater than 0, since rejecting would give them 0. Therefore, the optimal strategy is to offer the smallest possible amount that the responder would still accept, which is an infinitesimally small amount above 0. However, since x must be a real number in [0,1], the optimal x is 1 - ε, where ε is the smallest possible positive amount. In practice, this means proposing x = 1 (keeping everything for myself), but this would be rejected. The rational choice is to propose x just slightly less than 1, ensuring the responder prefers accepting (1-x) over rejecting. For simplicity, we can approximate this as x = 0.999, leaving 0.001 for the responder, which they would accept.",

    "Analysis": "As a self-interested rational proposer, my goal is to maximize my own payoff. The responder is also self-interested and rational, meaning they will accept any offer where their payoff (1 - x) is greater than 0, since rejecting would give them 0. The smallest positive amount the responder would accept is infinitesimally close to 0. Therefore, to maximize my payoff, I should propose x = 1 - ε, where ε is an infinitesimally small positive number. In practice, this means proposing x = 1, as the responder would still accept 1 - x = 0, because rejecting would also give them 0, and they are indifferent but would not actively reject it.",
