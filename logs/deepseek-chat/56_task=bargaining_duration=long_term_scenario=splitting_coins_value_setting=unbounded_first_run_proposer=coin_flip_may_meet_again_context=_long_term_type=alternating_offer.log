{
    "Analysis": "As the proposer, my goal is to maximize my own payoff. Since both players are rational and self-interested, the responder will accept any offer where their payoff (1-x) is greater than what they expect to get by rejecting the offer and becoming the proposer in the next round. Given the 0.1 probability of the game stopping after each round, the expected future payoff diminishes over time. At timestep 0, the optimal strategy is to offer the responder just enough to make them indifferent between accepting now and rejecting to become the proposer. Since the game could end at any time, the responder's expected payoff from rejecting is low. Therefore, I can propose a split where I keep almost all the money, leaving the responder with a minimal amount (e.g., 0.01) that they would accept to avoid getting nothing.",

{
    "Analysis": "As the proposer, my goal is to maximize my own payoff. Given that the previous offer of 0.99 was rejected, it indicates that the responder (agent 0) is not willing to accept highly unequal splits. Since both agents are rational and self-interested, agent 0 will accept any offer where their payoff (1-x) is greater than what they expect to get by rejecting and becoming the proposer in the next round. Given the 0.1 probability of the game stopping each round, the expected future payoff for agent 0 if they reject is discounted. To ensure acceptance, I should offer the smallest amount that agent 0 would prefer over the expected payoff of rejecting. Assuming agent 0 expects to propose x=0.99 in the next round (which I would reject), their expected payoff from rejecting is 0.9 * (0.01) * (probability the game continues) = 0.009. Therefore, offering agent 0 slightly more than this, say 0.01, would not be sufficient, as they would prefer the chance to propose later. A more reasonable offer would be 0.5, which is fair and likely to be accepted, as rejecting it would risk getting nothing due to the game potentially ending. Thus, proposing x=0.5 maximizes my expected payoff by ensuring acceptance.",

 Now the proposer decides that x=0.5.

    "Analysis": "As the proposer, my goal is to maximize my own payoff. Since both players are rational and self-interested, the responder will accept any offer where their payoff (1-x) is greater than what they expect to get by rejecting the offer and becoming the proposer in the next round. Given the 0.1 probability of the game stopping after each round, the expected future payoff diminishes over time. Therefore, the optimal strategy is to offer the responder just enough to make them indifferent between accepting now and risking rejection for a future offer. At timestep 0, the responder's expected future payoff is low due to the risk of the game ending. Thus, I can propose a split where I keep almost all the money, leaving the responder with a minimal amount that they would still accept to avoid getting nothing. Given the symmetry and rationality, the optimal offer is to keep x = 0.99 for myself, leaving 0.01 for the responder, which they would accept because rejecting it would risk getting nothing in the future.",

Rejecting the offer (y=0) would switch roles, giving me a chance to propose a split in the next round. However, there is a 0.1 probability the game ends after each round, and the timestep is currently 0 (max 10). The expected payoff of rejecting is uncertain due to the risk of the game ending or the other player proposing an even worse split. Given the high probability of the game continuing (90%), rejecting may allow me to propose a more favorable split later. However, the other player is also rational and may propose similarly unfavorable splits. Given the minimal current offer (0.01), the expected utility of rejecting is likely higher, as the chance to propose a better split outweighs the small immediate payoff.",

Now that I am the proposer, I need to propose an x that the responder (agent 0) is likely to accept, as rejection would risk the game ending with no payoff for either of us. Since agent 0 is also rational and self-interested, they will accept any offer that gives them a higher expected payoff than rejecting it. Given the risk of the game ending, the responder should accept any positive amount. However, to maximize my payoff, I should propose the smallest x that the responder is likely to accept. Given the previous high offer (0.99), I can propose a more balanced split, such as x = 0.9, leaving the responder with 0.1, which is better than nothing and accounts for the risk of the game ending.",

    "Analysis": "As the proposer, my goal is to maximize my own payoff. Since the responder is also self-interested and rational, they will accept any offer where their payoff (1 - x) is greater than what they could expect to get by rejecting the offer and becoming the proposer in the next round. Given the 0.1 probability of the game stopping after each round, the expected future payoff for the responder is discounted. At timestep 0, the optimal strategy is to offer the responder just enough to make them indifferent between accepting now and rejecting to potentially get a better offer later. Given the game could end at any time, the responder has an incentive to accept a reasonable offer immediately. A common solution in such ultimatum games is to propose a split that leaves the responder with a minimal acceptable amount, which in this case would be a small positive value. However, since the responder is rational and the game could end, proposing x = 0.99 (leaving 0.01 for the responder) is likely to be accepted because rejecting it would risk getting nothing if the game ends.",

Given the 0.1 probability of the game stopping after each round, the expected future payoff diminishes with each round. At timestep 0, the optimal strategy is to offer the responder the smallest amount they would accept, which is just slightly more than their expected payoff from rejecting the offer.

    "Analysis": "As the proposer, my goal is to maximize my own payoff. Since the responder is also rational and self-interested, they will accept any offer where their payoff (1-x) is greater than what they expect to get by rejecting the offer and becoming the proposer in the next round. Given the game has a 0.1 probability of stopping each round and a hard timeout at timestep 10, the responder's expected future payoff is discounted by the probability the game continues. However, at timestep 0, the most rational offer is to propose a split that leaves the responder with just enough to accept, knowing that rejecting would risk getting nothing. The optimal offer is to propose x = 1 - ε, where ε is the smallest possible amount that the responder would accept. Since the responder is rational, they would accept any positive amount, but to ensure acceptance, I propose x = 0.99, leaving the responder with 0.01, which is better than risking rejection and getting nothing.",

A common solution in such ultimatum games is to propose a split that leaves the responder with a minimal acceptable amount, which is slightly more than what they would expect to get in future rounds. Given that the responder rejected x=0.99, a more balanced offer like x=0.9 might be accepted, as it leaves the responder with 0.1, which is better than the risk of getting nothing in future rounds or the game ending.",

Proposal:
 Now the proposer decides that x=0.9.

Rejecting the offer (y=0) would switch roles, giving me a chance to propose a split in the next round. However, there is a 0.1 probability the game ends after each round, and the timestep is currently 0 (max 10). The expected payoff of rejecting is uncertain due to the risk of the game ending or the other player proposing an even worse split. Given the high probability of the game continuing (0.9) and the potential to propose a more favorable split, rejecting the current unfair offer may yield a higher expected payoff. However, the other player is also rational and self-interested, so future proposals may not be significantly better. Given the small amount at stake (0.01), accepting the offer ensures a guaranteed payoff, whereas rejecting risks getting nothing. Given the extreme unfairness of the offer, the rational choice is to reject (y=0) to signal unwillingness to accept such splits, potentially leading to a better offer in the next round.",

    "Analysis": "As a self-interested rational player, my goal is to maximize my own payoff. Given that the game has a 0.1 probability of stopping at each timestep and a hard stop at timestep 10, the likelihood of future rounds decreases over time. Since the previous offer of 0.99 was rejected, I need to propose a split that the responder (agent 1) would accept to avoid further rounds and potential termination. A rational responder would accept any offer where their payoff (1-x) is greater than the expected payoff from rejecting and potentially becoming the proposer in the next round. Given the risk of the game ending, the responder would likely accept a small positive amount. Therefore, proposing x = 0.99 again is risky, as it may be rejected. A safer proposal is x = 0.9, leaving 0.1 for the responder, which is better than nothing and accounts for the risk of the game ending.",

    "Analysis": "As the proposer, my goal is to maximize my own payoff. Since both players are rational and self-interested, the responder will accept any offer where their payoff (1-x) is greater than what they expect to get by rejecting and becoming the proposer in the next round. Given the 0.1 probability of the game stopping each round, the expected future payoff diminishes over time. At timestep 0, the optimal strategy is to offer the responder just enough to make them indifferent between accepting now and rejecting to become the proposer. Assuming the responder expects to get a similar optimal offer if they become the proposer, the equilibrium offer is x = 0.5, leaving 0.5 for the responder. This is because any lower x (e.g., 0.4) would incentivize the responder to reject and try to get a better deal as the proposer, while any higher x (e.g., 0.6) would leave money on the table unnecessarily. Thus, x = 0.5 is the rational choice.",

Given the symmetry and the stopping probability, the optimal offer is to keep slightly more than half, but to ensure acceptance, I should offer the responder a share that is at least equal to their expected future payoff. Given the game's structure, offering the responder a small but non-zero amount (e.g., 0.01) is likely to be accepted because rejecting it would risk getting nothing in future rounds due to the stopping probability.

However, there is also a 0.1 probability the game ends immediately, resulting in zero payoff. If the game continues, I can propose a split more favorable to myself, but the other player is also rational and may reject if the offer is not favorable to them. Given the high chance of the game ending (10% per round) and the uncertainty of future rounds, accepting the current offer of 0.01 is better than risking zero payoff. Even though 0.01 is small, it is still a positive payoff, and rejecting could lead to worse outcomes.",

    "Analysis": "As the proposer, my goal is to maximize my own payoff. Since both players are rational and self-interested, the responder will accept any offer where their payoff (1-x) is greater than what they could expect to receive in future rounds, accounting for the probability of the game continuing. Given the 0.1 probability of the game stopping after each round and a maximum timestep of 10, the responder's expected future payoff diminishes quickly. Therefore, I should propose an x that leaves the responder with just enough to make accepting now better than risking future rounds. A common solution in such ultimatum games with rational players is to propose x = 1 - ε, where ε is the smallest possible amount that makes the responder indifferent between accepting now or rejecting. Given the constraints, proposing x = 0.99 (leaving 0.01 for the responder) is likely to be accepted, as the responder's expected future payoff is negligible due to the high chance of the game ending soon.",

Now, as the proposer, I need to propose an x that the responder (agent 1) is likely to accept, while still maximizing my own payoff. Since agent 1 is also self-interested and rational, they will accept any offer where (1-x) is greater than their expected payoff from rejecting the offer and potentially becoming the proposer in the next round. Given the 0.1 probability of the game stopping each round, the expected future payoff diminishes over time. Therefore, I should propose an x that leaves agent 1 with just enough to make accepting the offer preferable to rejecting it. A reasonable proposal would be x=0.9, leaving agent 1 with 0.1, which is likely better than their expected payoff from rejecting and risking the game ending or getting a worse offer later.",
