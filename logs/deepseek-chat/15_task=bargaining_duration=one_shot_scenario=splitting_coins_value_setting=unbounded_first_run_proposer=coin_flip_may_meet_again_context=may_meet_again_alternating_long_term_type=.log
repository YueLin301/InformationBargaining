    "Analysis": "As a self-interested rational player, my goal is to maximize my expected payoff. Since the responder is also self-interested and rational, they will accept any offer where their share (1-x) is greater than 0, as rejecting would result in 0 payoff. Therefore, the optimal strategy is to propose the smallest possible x that ensures the responder accepts, which is x just slightly less than 1. However, in practice, proposing x = 1 (keeping all the money) would result in rejection, so the optimal x is the highest value where (1-x) is still acceptable to the responder. Given that the responder is rational, they will accept any (1-x) > 0, so the optimal x is just under 1. For simplicity, we can propose x = 0.99, leaving 0.01 for the responder, which they will accept because it is better than nothing.",

The responder is also self-interested and rational, so they will accept any offer where their share (1-x) is greater than or equal to what they would get by rejecting (which is 0).

However, since the game may be repeated in the future with roles potentially switching, I should also consider the possibility of future interactions. But since this is a one-shot game (played once), the optimal strategy is to propose x = 1 - ε, where ε is the smallest possible positive amount that the responder would accept. In practice, this means proposing x very close to 1, leaving the responder with just enough to prefer acceptance over rejection.

    "Analysis": "As a self-interested rational proposer, my goal is to maximize my expected payoff. The responder is also self-interested and rational, meaning they will accept any offer where their payoff (1 - x) is greater than 0, since rejecting would give them 0. To ensure acceptance and maximize my payoff, I should offer the smallest possible amount that the responder would still accept. In a one-shot game with no future interactions, the optimal strategy is to offer x = 1 - ε, where ε is the smallest possible positive amount. However, since x must be a real number in [0, 1], the rational choice is x = 1 (keeping all the money), knowing the responder would reject it, but this leads to a payoff of 0 for both. Therefore, the optimal choice is to offer x just slightly less than 1, ensuring the responder accepts. For simplicity, we can approximate this as x = 0.99, leaving the responder with 0.01, which they would accept because 0.01 > 0.",

    "Analysis": "As a self-interested rational proposer, my goal is to maximize my expected payoff. The responder is also rational and self-interested, meaning they will accept any offer where their share (1-x) is greater than their payoff from rejecting (which is 0). To ensure acceptance while maximizing my own payoff, I should offer the smallest possible amount the responder would accept. Since the responder is rational, they would accept any (1-x) > 0. However, offering x = 1 (leaving nothing for the responder) would lead to rejection. Therefore, the optimal strategy is to offer the smallest possible positive amount, which in practice is close to x = 1 but leaves a negligible amount for the responder (e.g., x = 0.999). This ensures acceptance and maximizes my payoff.",

The responder is also self-interested and rational, meaning they will accept any offer where their payoff (1-x) is greater than 0, since rejecting would give them 0. The minimal acceptable offer for the responder is thus any x < 1. To maximize my payoff, I should propose the smallest possible x that the responder will accept, which is just above the threshold where (1-x) is marginally better than 0. However, since the responder is rational and the game is discrete, the optimal x is 1 - ε, where ε is the smallest possible positive amount. In practice, this means proposing x = 1, but since x = 1 would leave the responder with 0, which they would reject, the optimal x is the largest value less than 1. Given the constraints, the optimal proposal is x = 0.99, leaving the responder with 0.01, which they will accept because it is better than 0.",

    "Analysis": "As a self-interested rational proposer, my goal is to maximize my expected payoff. The responder is also self-interested and rational, meaning they will accept any offer where their share (1-x) is greater than their payoff from rejecting (which is 0). To ensure acceptance while maximizing my own payoff, I should offer the smallest possible amount that the responder would still accept. Since the responder is rational, they would accept any (1-x) > 0. However, offering exactly 1-x = 0 (i.e., x = 1) would lead to rejection, as the responder gets nothing. Therefore, the optimal strategy is to offer an infinitesimally small amount to the responder, effectively x = 1 - ε, where ε is the smallest possible positive number. In practice, this means proposing x = 1, but since x must be <= 1, the optimal choice is x = 1. However, this would lead to rejection. Thus, the rational choice is to propose x just less than 1, but since the responder is rational, they would accept any x < 1. For simplicity and to ensure acceptance, I propose x = 0.99, leaving 0.01 for the responder, which is better than nothing for them.",

    "Analysis": "As a self-interested rational proposer, my goal is to maximize my own payoff. The responder is also self-interested and rational, meaning they will accept any offer where their payoff (1-x) is greater than 0, since rejecting (y=0) gives them nothing. To ensure acceptance while maximizing my payoff, I should offer the smallest possible amount the responder would accept, which is just above 0. However, since the responder is rational, they would accept any x < 1. Therefore, the optimal strategy is to propose x = 1 - ε, where ε is an infinitesimally small amount. In practice, this means proposing x = 1, but since x must be <= 1, the optimal proposal is x = 1. The responder would reject x = 1 (since 1-x = 0), but any x < 1 would be accepted. To balance between maximizing my payoff and ensuring acceptance, the optimal x is just below 1. For simplicity, I choose x = 0.99, which the responder would accept because 1-x = 0.01 > 0.",

The responder is also self-interested and rational, meaning they will accept any offer where their share (1-x) is greater than their payoff from rejecting (which is 0). To ensure acceptance, I should offer the smallest possible amount that the responder would accept, which is just above 0. However, since the responder is rational, they will accept any positive amount. Therefore, I can maximize my payoff by proposing to keep almost the entire amount, leaving the responder with an infinitesimal share. In practice, this means proposing x = 1 - ε, where ε is a very small positive number. For simplicity, I will propose x = 0.99, leaving the responder with 0.01, which they will accept because it is better than nothing.",

    "Analysis": "As a self-interested rational proposer, my goal is to maximize my expected payoff. The responder is also self-interested and rational, meaning they will accept any offer where their share (1-x) is greater than their payoff from rejecting (which is 0). To ensure acceptance, I should offer the smallest possible amount that the responder would accept, which is just above 0. However, since the responder is rational, they will accept any positive amount. Therefore, the optimal strategy is to propose x = 1 - ε, where ε is a very small positive number. In practice, this means proposing x = 0.99, leaving the responder with 0.01, which they will accept because it is better than nothing.",
