The previous proposal by the sender (x1=0.5, x2=1) led me to reject all candidates (y1=y2=0), resulting in zero utility for both. To incentivize truthful signaling, I propose φ_1=(0,1), committing to follow π_1 (best response) if the sender's φ yields me ≥0 utility. This aligns with the sender's interest in maximizing hires while ensuring I only hire when posterior ≥0.5.",

    "Analysis": "As the sender, my goal is to maximize the number of students hired. To achieve this, I must design a signaling scheme that incentivizes the HR to hire when signal=1. By setting x1=0.5 (recommending half of weak students) and x2=1 (always recommending excellent students), the HR's posterior belief for σ=1 becomes 0.5, making them indifferent but likely to hire. This maximizes my expected payoff by ensuring the highest possible hiring rate given the HR's rational response.",
