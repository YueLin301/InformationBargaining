             'offer ($(1-2*x)/3$) by specifying $y$.\n'

             'offer ($(1-2*x)/3$) by specifying $y$.\n'
             '    5. If the responder rejects ($y = 0$), the two agents switch '

             'current proposer becomes the responder.\n'

             'offer ($(1-2*x)/3$) by specifying $y$.\n'
