This ensures the sender must use full revelation to meet the receiver's expected payoff of 1/3, leading the receiver to follow π₁.

    "Analysis": "As the sender, I aim to maximize my expected payoff by inducing the receiver to choose action 1 as often as possible. By setting x1=0.5 and x2=1, the receiver observes σ=1 with posterior P(s=1|σ=1)=0.5, making them indifferent. Assuming they break ties in favor of action 1 (my desired outcome), this maximizes my expected payoff. In state 0, σ=1 is sent with probability 0.5 (yielding my reward 1 if action 1 is taken), and in state 1, σ=1 is always sent (guaranteeing action 1). This results in an expected payoff of 2/3.",

For σ=1, the posterior is P(s=1|σ=1)=0.5, making the receiver indifferent between actions (E[r^j]=0 for both a=0 and a=1). Since the receiver is indifferent, any y2 is permissible. However, to maximize potential gains when s=1 occurs (50% chance under σ=1), the receiver rationally chooses y2=1 to capture the +1 payoff when s=1, despite the risk of -1 in s=0, as the expected payoff remains zero regardless.",
