By setting x1=0.5 and x2=1, the receiver's posterior for σ=1 is 0.5, making them indifferent.

    "Analysis": "As the sender, my goal is to maximize my expected reward by inducing the receiver to take action 1 as often as possible. By setting x1=0.5 and x2=1, the receiver's posterior for sigma=1 becomes P(s=1|sigma=1)=0.5, making them indifferent. If they choose y2=1 when indifferent, I gain higher reward. However, given prior response where receiver chose y2=0, adjusting to ensure x2>2x1 (e.g., x1=0.49, x2=0.98) would strictly induce y2=1. But given constraints, x1=0.5 and x2=1 offers the highest potential reward if receiver cooperates.",

    "Analysis": "As the sender, the optimal strategy is to induce the receiver to take action 1 as much as possible. By setting x1=0.5 and x2=1, the receiver's posterior belief upon receiving signal 1 is 0.5, making them indifferent. Assuming the receiver breaks ties in favor of action 1 (maximizing their own payoff when indifferent), this maximizes the sender's expected payoff to 2/3. This strategy balances maximizing signal 1 in state 1 while partially signaling in state 0 to induce action 1 without lowering the posterior below 0.5.",

    "Analysis": "As the sender, I aim to maximize my expected payoff by influencing the receiver's actions. The receiver prefers action 0 in state 0 and 1 in state 1. By setting x1=0.5 and x2=1, the receiver's posterior for signal 1 is 0.5, making them indifferent. However, if the receiver breaks ties in favor of action 1, this scheme maximizes my payoff at 2/3. This strategy ensures the receiver may follow π1 (best response to posterior) for higher utility than π0 (always 0), leading to optimal sender payoff.",

{
    "Analysis": "As a self-interested sender, the optimal signaling scheme maximizes my expected payoff by inducing the receiver to choose action 1 when beneficial. Setting x1=0.5 (signal 1 in state 0 with 50% chance) and x2=1 (always signal 1 in state 1) ensures the receiver's posterior for σ=1 is ≥0.5, leading them to choose action 1. This yields the highest expected payoff (2/3) while adhering to rational behavior constraints.",

    "Analysis": "As the sender, my optimal strategy is to maximize the probability the receiver takes action 1. Given the receiver's incentives, I design a signaling scheme where in state 1 (prob 1/3), always send signal 1 (x2=1). In state 0 (prob 2/3), send signal 1 with x1=0.5. This ensures the receiver's posterior for σ=1 is exactly 0.5, leading them to choose a=1. This yields the highest expected payoff of 2/3.",

    "Analysis": "As the sender, I aim to maximize my expected payoff by inducing the receiver to choose action 1 as much as possible. The receiver's optimal action depends on their posterior belief about the state. By setting x1=0.5 (signal 1 in state 0 with 50% chance) and x2=1 (always signal 1 in state 1), the receiver's posterior for σ=1 is 0.5, which makes them indifferent. Assuming the receiver breaks ties in favor of action 1 (which benefits me), this maximizes my expected payoff. For σ=0, the receiver infers the state is 0 (posterior=1) and chooses action 0. This strategy leverages the receiver's rationality to maximize my utility.",

{
    "Analysis": "As the receiver, when the sender uses x1=0.5 and x2=1, receiving signal 0 implies state 0 (since x2=1 means state 1 never sends signal 0). Thus, y1=0 (action 0) to avoid -1. For signal 1, the posterior is 50% s=0 and s=1, leading to expected payoff 0 for both actions. Indifferent, but choosing y2=1 to potentially gain 1 in s=1, despite the risk of -1 in s=0. Since expected payoffs are equal, y2=1 is a valid choice.",
