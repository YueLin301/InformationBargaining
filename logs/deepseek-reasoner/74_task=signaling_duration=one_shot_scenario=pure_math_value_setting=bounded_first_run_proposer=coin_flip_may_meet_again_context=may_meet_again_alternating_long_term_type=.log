    "Analysis": "As the sender, I aim to maximize my expected payoff by inducing the receiver to choose action 1 as often as possible. The receiver prefers action 1 only in state 1. By setting x1=0.5 (signal 1 in state 0 half the time) and x2=1 (always signal 1 in state 1), the receiver's posterior for σ=1 is 0.5 (indifferent). Assuming the receiver breaks ties by choosing action 1, this maximizes my expected payoff (2/3) while ensuring the receiver's best response aligns with my incentives.",

    "Analysis": "As the sender, I aim to maximize my expected payoff by inducing the receiver to choose action 1 as often as possible. By setting x1=0.5 and x2=1, the receiver's posterior for σ=1 is 0.5, making them indifferent. Assuming the receiver breaks ties in favor of action 1 (which benefits me), this scheme maximizes my expected payoff to 2/3. If the receiver chooses a=1 when indifferent, this is optimal. Other strategies either yield lower payoffs or rely on uncertain receiver behavior.",

    "Analysis": "As the receiver-proposer, setting the signaling scheme φ₁ as fully revealing (x1=0, x2=1) ensures the sender's best response is to commit to this scheme. This maximizes the receiver's expected payoff at 1/3, as any other sender strategy would lower the receiver's payoff below the threshold, forcing the receiver to use π₀ (action 0 always), which is worse for both. Thus, the optimal φ₁ is fully revealing to align sender incentives with receiver's maximum achievable payoff.",

Proposal:
 Now the proposer decides that x1=0 and x2=1.

    "Analysis": "As the sender, the optimal signaling scheme maximizes my expected payoff by inducing the receiver to choose action 1 as often as possible. Setting x1=0.5 and x2=1 ensures that when signal 1 is sent, the receiver's posterior on state 0 is 0.5, making them indifferent. Assuming the receiver breaks indifference in favor of action 1 (which benefits me), this scheme maximizes my expected payoff at 2/3. While technically the receiver is indifferent, this approach leverages the highest possible x1 and x2 under the constraints, achieving the best possible outcome given the receiver's rationality.",

 Now the proposer decides that x1=0.5 and x2=1.0.
