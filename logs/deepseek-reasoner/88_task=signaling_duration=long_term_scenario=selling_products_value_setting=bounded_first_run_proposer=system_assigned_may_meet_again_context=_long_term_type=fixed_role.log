    "Analysis": "To maximize my payoff, I need the receiver to buy (action 1) as much as possible. Setting x1=0.4 and x2=1 ensures that when sigma=1, the receiver's posterior belief about s=1 is ≈0.555 (>0.5), inducing them to buy. When sigma=0, the receiver knows s=0, so they won't buy. This balances maximizing signals for bad products while ensuring the receiver's incentive to buy when recommended.",
