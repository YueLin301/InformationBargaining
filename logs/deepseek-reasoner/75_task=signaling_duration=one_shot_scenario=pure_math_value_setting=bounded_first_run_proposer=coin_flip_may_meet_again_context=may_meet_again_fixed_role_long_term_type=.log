    "Analysis": "As the sender, the optimal signaling scheme maximizes my expected payoff by inducing the receiver to choose action 1 when the state is 1 and as often as possible in state 0. By setting x1=0.5 and x2=1, the receiver's posterior for s=1 when seeing signal 1 is exactly 0.5, making them indifferent. Assuming the receiver breaks ties in favor of action 1, this yields the highest expected payoff of 2/3.",

    "Analysis": "As the sender, the optimal signaling scheme maximizes the probability the receiver takes action 1. Given the receiver's incentives (prefer action 0 in state 0, 1 in state 1), the sender must induce a posterior ≥0.5 for state 1 when sending signal 1. Setting x1=0.5 (signal 1 with 50% chance in state 0) and x2=1 (always signal 1 in state 1) makes the receiver indifferent but likely choose action 1, yielding the sender's maximum expected payoff of 2/3.",

    "Analysis": "As the sender, the optimal signaling scheme maximizes the probability of the receiver taking action 1 in both states. By setting x1=0.5 and x2=1, the receiver's posterior for signal 1 is 0.5, inducing indifference. Assuming the receiver breaks ties in favor of action 1 when indifferent, this maximizes the sender's expected payoff. This scheme ensures the receiver takes action 1 for signal 1 (induced in both states) and action 0 for signal 0 (only in state 0).

{
    "Analysis": "As the sender, the optimal signaling scheme maximizes my expected payoff by inducing the receiver to choose action 1 as much as possible. Setting x1=0.5 (signal 1 with 50% chance in state 0) and x2=1 (always signal 1 in state 1) ensures that when the receiver observes signal 1, their posterior belief is exactly 0.5. Although the receiver is indifferent, they may still choose action 1, yielding my maximum expected payoff of 2/3. This balances persuasion in state 0 while truthfully revealing state 1.",

For signal 1, posterior is P(s=0)=0.5 and P(s=1)=0.5. Receiver is indifferent between a=0 and a=1 as both yield expected payoff 0. Choosing y2=1 maximizes sender's payoff, but receiver is self-interested. However, since receiver's own payoff is unaffected, any y2 is valid. Choosing y2=1 aligns with potential future cooperation but remains rational as payoff is unchanged.",
