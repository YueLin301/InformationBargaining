    "Analysis": "As the sender, the optimal strategy is to maximize the probability of sale by inducing the buyer to purchase whenever possible. By setting x1=0.5 and x2=1, the seller ensures that signal 1 induces a posterior belief of 0.5 for the buyer, making them indifferent. Assuming the receiver buys when indifferent, this maximizes the seller's expected payoff to 2/3. This strategy balances the need to recommend bad products enough to increase sales while maintaining sufficient credibility for the buyer to purchase.",

To convince the buyer (receiver) to buy, signals must ensure that when 'recommend' (σ=1) is sent, the buyer's posterior belief of good quality (s=1) is ≥0.5. Setting x1=0.5 (signal 1 for bad products 50% of the time) and x2=1 (always signal 1 for good products) achieves this. For σ=1, the posterior is 0.5 (inducing purchase), and for σ=0, the posterior is 0 (no purchase). This maximizes expected sales (2/3 of products sold).",

    "Analysis": "As the sender, the optimal signaling scheme induces the receiver to buy when the posterior probability of good quality is at least 0.5. By setting x1=0.5 and x2=1, the receiver is indifferent when seeing σ=1 (posterior 0.5) but prefers π1 over π0, leading them to buy (assuming tie-break favors sender). This maximizes the sender's expected payoff to 2/3.",
