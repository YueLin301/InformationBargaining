    "Analysis": "As the initial proposer at timestep 0, considering the responder's rational rejection threshold based on future expected payoffs (accounting for 0.9 continuation probability and 10-step horizon), the optimal offer balances immediate acceptance with the responder's alternative of pursuing higher future payoffs. Backward induction shows the responder's expected value from rejecting is ~0.3487, so offering x ≈ 0.6513 makes them indifferent. To maximize my payoff, propose x ≈ 0.65, which they should accept to avoid rejection risks.",
