    "Analysis": "As the proposer, maximizing my payoff requires setting x as high as possible while ensuring the responder accepts. The responder, being rational, will accept any x ≤ 0.5 since their payoff (1-2x)/3 ≥ 0. At x=0.5, their payoff is zero, which they should accept (indifferent but self-interested). Thus, x=0.5 maximizes my payoff to (1+2*0.5)/3 = 2/3.",
