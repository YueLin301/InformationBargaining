Since hiring yields zero expected utility (same as not hiring), any y2 is valid.

For σ=1, the posterior belief is 50% s=1 and 50% s=0, making the receiver indifferent between hiring (expected payoff 0) and not hiring (expected payoff 0). As a rational player, any y2 is permissible. Choosing y2=1 maximizes sender's payoff but receiver is indifferent. Arbitrarily selecting y2=1 as it aligns with the signal's positive recommendation.",
