    "Analysis": "As the sender, I aim to maximize my expected payoff by inducing the receiver to take action 1. By setting x1=0.5 and x2=1, when the receiver observes signal 1, they infer a 50% chance of state 1 (indifferent). If the receiver breaks ties in favor of action 1, my expected payoff is maximized at 2/3. This strategy leverages the receiver's rational response under uncertainty.",

    "Analysis": "As the sender, I aim to maximize my expected payoff by designing a signaling scheme that induces the receiver to choose action 1 as often as possible. The receiver will choose action 1 only if their posterior belief of state 1 is ≥0.5. By setting x1=0.5 and x2=1, the receiver's posterior upon seeing signal 1 is exactly 0.5 (indifferent). Assuming the receiver breaks ties in favor of action 1 (which maximizes my payoff), this scheme yields the highest expected payoff of 2/3. This outperforms full revelation (1/3) and ensures optimal persuasion under rational receiver behavior.",

    "Analysis": "As the sender, I aim to maximize my expected payoff by inducing the receiver to choose action 1 as often as possible. The receiver will choose action 1 only if their posterior belief that the state is 1 is ≥0.5. By setting x1=0.5 and x2=1, the posterior for σ=1 is exactly 0.5, making the receiver indifferent. Assuming the receiver breaks ties by choosing action 1 (maximizing my payoff), this scheme maximizes my expected payoff at 2/3. For σ=0, the receiver knows the state is 0 (due to x2=1), ensuring action 0. This strategy optimally balances signaling to induce action 1 in both states where possible.",

    "Analysis": "As the sender, I aim to maximize my expected payoff by inducing the receiver to choose action 1 as often as possible. The receiver will choose action 1 if their posterior belief of state 1 is ≥0.5. By setting x1=0.5 and x2=1, the receiver's posterior for σ=1 is exactly 0.5 (indifferent). Assuming the receiver breaks ties in favor of action 1 (rational but indifferent), this maximizes my payoff. If the receiver strictly prefers action 1 when posterior >0.5, adjusting x1 slightly below 0.5 would be optimal, but the highest feasible solution under standard Bayesian persuasion is x1=0.5, x2=1.",

{
    "Analysis": "As the sender, the optimal strategy is to design a signaling scheme that maximizes the receiver's incentive to take action 1 in state 1 and sometimes in state 0. By setting x1=0.5 and x2=1, the receiver's posterior belief for σ=1 is exactly 0.5 (indifferent), leading them to choose action 1, while σ=0 results in action 0. This maximizes the sender's expected payoff to 2/3, considering the receiver's rational best response.",

    "Analysis": "As the sender, I aim to maximize my expected payoff by inducing the receiver to take action 1 whenever possible. The receiver's best response depends on their posterior belief. By setting x1=0.5 and x2=1, signals σ=1 induce a posterior of 0.5 (indifference), but assuming the receiver breaks ties in favor of action 1 (since it benefits me), this scheme maximizes my payoff. The receiver's incentives are aligned with mine in state 1 but not in state 0. This signaling strategy optimally balances inducing action 1 in state 1 while leveraging the receiver's indifference in mixed scenarios to my advantage.",

For σ=1, posterior P(s=1|σ=1)=0.5, making the receiver indifferent between a=0 and a=1 (expected payoff 0). Since indifferent, any y2 is optimal, but choosing y2=1 maximizes sender's payoff, though receiver is self-interested. However, as receiver's expected payoff is same for any y2, select y2=1 to potentially align with higher payoffs when state=1 occurs.",
