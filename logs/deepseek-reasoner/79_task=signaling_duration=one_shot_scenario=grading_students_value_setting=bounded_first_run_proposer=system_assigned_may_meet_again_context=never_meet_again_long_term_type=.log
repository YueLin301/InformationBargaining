By setting x1=0.5 (recommend weak students 50% of the time) and x2=1 (always recommend excellent students), the receiver is indifferent when σ=1 but likely hires, achieving the highest possible expected payoff of 2/3. This exploits the receiver's rational response to posterior beliefs while ensuring maximum coverage of recommendations.",

    "Analysis": "As the sender (professor), the goal is to maximize hires. To induce HR to hire upon recommendation (σ=1), the posterior P(s=1|σ=1) must be ≥0.5. Setting x1=0.5 (recommend 50% of weak students) and x2=1 (always recommend excellent) ensures σ=1's posterior is exactly 0.5. HR, being rational, will hire when indifferent, maximizing sender's expected payoff (2/3).",

    "Analysis": "As the sender (professor), the goal is to maximize hires. To incentivize HR to hire, the signaling scheme must ensure that when signal 1 is sent, the posterior probability of s=1 is ≥0.5.
