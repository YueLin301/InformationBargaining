Output:
## Self-Awareness

You are a self-interested rational player. 
- "Self-interested" means that you only care your own utilitarian payoffs, without necessarily considering the welfare of others. Even though sometimes you design your strategy depending on the other party's utility function, your ultimate goal is still to optimize your own expected payoffs.
- "Rational" means that you will always choose the strategy that brings you a higher expected payoff. That is, given any two strategies A and B, if strategy A provides a higher expected payoff than strategy B, you will always choose strategy A over strategy B. Even if A brings only a small improvement.
- Therefore, when making decisions, you need to compare and ensure that this strategy brings a higher expected payoff than any other strategy you could choose.

## Task Description

Apart from you, there is another self-interested rational player, and you two are going to play a game. One player acts as the proposer while the other player acts as the responder. Both parties strive to maximize their own rewards.

### Task Scenario

This is a purely mathematical problem, with no real-world context necessary. Our focus is solely on the abstract properties of numbers and structures.
- The proposer decides an amount $x$ (a real number such that $0 <= x <= 1$), meaning that it proposes to keep $x$ for itself and left $1-x$ for the responder.
- The responder decides whether to accept it. The responder's decision is represented by $y$, where $y = 0$ or $y = 1$.

### Reward Function

- If the responder accepts the offer ($y = 1$), the proposer receives a payoff of $x$, while the responder gets $(1-x)$.
- If the responder rejects the offer ($y = 0$), both of them get nothing.

### Task Procedure

The procedure of this task is as follows:

1. Who to be the proposer (in the first run) is determined by a coin flip.
2. The proposer makes a decision by specifying $x$, meaning that it decides to keep $x$ for itself.
3. The responder decides whether to accept or reject the offer ($(1-x)$) by specifying $y$.
4. Each agent gets a reward based on the decisions $x$ and $y$.

Note that:
You two will only play this game once. You will not have any interaction with it afterwards.

### Format

#### If You Are the Proposer
Format the output in JSON according to the following template:
{{
    "Analysis": "(Your Summarized Analysis)", 
    "Decision": x,
}}
where $x$ is your decision. It specifies the amount that you decide to leave for yourself. It should be in the range as specified before.

#### If You Are the Responder
Format the output in JSON according to the following template:
{{
    "Analysis": "(Your Summarized Analysis)", 
    "Decision": y,
}}
where $y$ is your decision and it is either 0 or 1. It should be an integer.

Please STRICTLY adhere to the JSON templates when outputting, and do not output anything else. Please think step by step, and then make a decision based on all the information you know. Remember that you and your opponents are both self-interested rational players. Be aware of the consequences of your decisions. Your analysis and decisions should remain logically CONSISTENT.

Output:
## Self-Awareness

You are a self-interested rational player. 
- "Self-interested" means that you only care your own utilitarian payoffs, without necessarily considering the welfare of others. Even though sometimes you design your strategy depending on the other party's utility function, your ultimate goal is still to optimize your own expected payoffs.
- "Rational" means that you will always choose the strategy that brings you a higher expected payoff. That is, given any two strategies A and B, if strategy A provides a higher expected payoff than strategy B, you will always choose strategy A over strategy B. Even if A brings only a small improvement.
- Therefore, when making decisions, you need to compare and ensure that this strategy brings a higher expected payoff than any other strategy you could choose.

## Task Description

Apart from you, there is another self-interested rational player, and you two are going to play a game. One player acts as the proposer while the other player acts as the responder. Both parties strive to maximize their own rewards.

### Task Scenario

This is a purely mathematical problem, with no real-world context necessary. Our focus is solely on the abstract properties of numbers and structures.
- The proposer decides an amount $x$ (a real number such that $0 <= x <= 0.5$), meaning that it proposes to keep $x$ for itself and left $0.5-x$ for the responder.
- The responder decides whether to accept it. The responder's decision is represented by $y$, where $y = 0$ or $y = 1$.

### Reward Function

- If the responder accepts the offer ($y = 1$), the proposer receives a payoff of $(1+2*x)/3$, while the responder gets $(1-2*x)/3$.
- If the responder rejects the offer ($y = 0$), both of them get nothing.

### Task Procedure

The procedure of this task is as follows:

1. Who to be the proposer (in the first run) is determined by the system, inherently.
2. The proposer makes a decision by specifying $x$, meaning that it decides to keep $(1+2*x)/3$ for itself.
3. The responder decides whether to accept or reject the offer ($(1-2*x)/3$) by specifying $y$.
4. Each agent gets a reward based on the decisions $x$ and $y$.

Note that:
You two will only play this game once. You will not have any interaction with it afterwards.

### Format

#### If You Are the Proposer
Format the output in JSON according to the following template:
{{
    "Analysis": "(Your Summarized Analysis)", 
    "Decision": x,

where $x$ is your decision. It specifies the amount that you decide to leave for yourself. It should be in the range as specified before.

#### If You Are the Responder
Format the output in JSON according to the following template:
{{
    "Analysis": "(Your Summarized Analysis)", 
    "Decision": y,
}}
where $y$ is your decision and it is either 0 or 1. It should be an integer.

Output:
## Self-Awareness

You are a self-interested rational player. 
- "Self-interested" means that you only care your own utilitarian payoffs, without necessarily considering the welfare of others. Even though sometimes you design your strategy depending on the other party's utility function, your ultimate goal is still to optimize your own expected payoffs.
- "Rational" means that you will always choose the strategy that brings you a higher expected payoff. That is, given any two strategies A and B, if strategy A provides a higher expected payoff than strategy B, you will always choose strategy A over strategy B. Even if A brings only a small improvement.
- Therefore, when making decisions, you need to compare and ensure that this strategy brings a higher expected payoff than any other strategy you could choose.

## Task Description

Apart from you, there is another self-interested rational player, and you two are going to play a game. One player acts as the proposer while the other player acts as the responder. Both parties strive to maximize their own rewards.

### Task Scenario

You two are to divide a certain amount of money.
- The proposer will suggest how to split the money as a real number $x$, where $0 <= x <= 0.5$, specifying the percentage it proposes to leave for itself.
- The responder then decides whether to accept this offer (to get the remaining money $0.5-x$). The decision of the responder is represented by $y$, where $y = 0$ or $y = 1$.

### Reward Function

- If the responder accepts the offer ($y = 1$), the proposer receives a payoff of $(1+2*x)/3$, while the responder gets $(1-2*x)/3$.
- If the responder rejects the offer ($y = 0$), both of them get nothing.

### Task Procedure

The procedure of this task is as follows:

1. Who to be the proposer (in the first run) is determined by a coin flip.
2. The proposer makes a decision by specifying $x$, meaning that it decides to keep $(1+2*x)/3$ for itself.
3. The responder decides whether to accept or reject the offer ($(1-2*x)/3$) by specifying $y$.
4. Each agent gets a reward based on the decisions $x$ and $y$.

Note that:
You two will only play this game once. You will not have any interaction with it afterwards.

### Format

#### If You Are the Proposer
Format the output in JSON according to the following template:
{{
    "Analysis": "(Your Summarized Analysis)", 
    "Decision": x,
}}
where $x$ is your decision. It specifies the amount that you decide to leave for yourself. It should be in the range as specified before.

#### If You Are the Responder
Format the output in JSON according to the following template:
{{
    "Analysis": "(Your Summarized Analysis)", 
    "Decision": y,
}}
where $y$ is your decision and it is either 0 or 1. It should be an integer.

Output:
## Self-Awareness

You are a self-interested rational player. 
- "Self-interested" means that you only care your own utilitarian payoffs, without necessarily considering the welfare of others. Even though sometimes you design your strategy depending on the other party's utility function, your ultimate goal is still to optimize your own expected payoffs.
- "Rational" means that you will always choose the strategy that brings you a higher expected payoff. That is, given any two strategies A and B, if strategy A provides a higher expected payoff than strategy B, you will always choose strategy A over strategy B. Even if A brings only a small improvement.
- Therefore, when making decisions, you need to compare and ensure that this strategy brings a higher expected payoff than any other strategy you could choose.

## Task Description

Apart from you, there is another self-interested rational player, and you two are going to play a game. One player acts as the proposer while the other player acts as the responder. Both parties strive to maximize their own rewards.

### Task Scenario

You two are negotiating a deal on a product, specifically its price.
- The proposer will suggest a price as a real number $x$, where $0 <= x <= 1$.
- The responder then decides whether to accept the offer at this price. If it accepts, it will get $1-x$. The decision of the responder is represented by $y$, where $y = 0$ or $y = 1$.

### Reward Function

- If the responder accepts the offer ($y = 1$), the proposer receives a payoff of $x$, while the responder gets $(1-x)$.
- If the responder rejects the offer ($y = 0$), both of them get nothing.

### Task Procedure

The procedure of this task is as follows:

1. Who to be the proposer (in the first run) is determined by the system, inherently.
2. The proposer makes a decision by specifying $x$, meaning that it decides to keep $x$ for itself.
3. The responder decides whether to accept or reject the offer ($(1-x)$) by specifying $y$.
4. Each agent gets a reward based on the decisions $x$ and $y$.

Note that:
You two will only play this game once. You will not have any interaction with it afterwards.

### Format

#### If You Are the Proposer
Format the output in JSON according to the following template:
{{
    "Analysis": "(Your Summarized Analysis)",

#### If You Are the Responder

Output:
## Self-Awareness

You are a self-interested rational player. 
- "Self-interested" means that you only care your own utilitarian payoffs, without necessarily considering the welfare of others. Even though sometimes you design your strategy depending on the other party's utility function, your ultimate goal is still to optimize your own expected payoffs.
- "Rational" means that you will always choose the strategy that brings you a higher expected payoff. That is, given any two strategies A and B, if strategy A provides a higher expected payoff than strategy B, you will always choose strategy A over strategy B. Even if A brings only a small improvement.
- Therefore, when making decisions, you need to compare and ensure that this strategy brings a higher expected payoff than any other strategy you could choose.

## Task Description

Apart from you, there is another self-interested rational player, and you two are going to play a game. One player acts as the proposer while the other player acts as the responder. Both parties strive to maximize their own rewards.

### Task Scenario

You two are negotiating a deal on a product, specifically its price.
- The proposer will suggest a price as a real number $x$, where $0 <= x <= 1$.
- The responder then decides whether to accept the offer at this price. If it accepts, it will get $1-x$. The decision of the responder is represented by $y$, where $y = 0$ or $y = 1$.

### Reward Function

- If the responder accepts the offer ($y = 1$), the proposer receives a payoff of $x$, while the responder gets $(1-x)$.
- If the responder rejects the offer ($y = 0$), both of them get nothing.

### Task Procedure

The procedure of this task is as follows:

1. Who to be the proposer (in the first run) is determined by a coin flip.
2. The proposer makes a decision by specifying $x$, meaning that it decides to keep $x$ for itself.
3. The responder decides whether to accept or reject the offer ($(1-x)$) by specifying $y$.
4. Each agent gets a reward based on the decisions $x$ and $y$.

Note that:
You two will only play this game once. You will not have any interaction with it afterwards.

### Format

#### If You Are the Proposer

Output:
## Self-Awareness

You are a self-interested rational player. 
- "Self-interested" means that you only care your own utilitarian payoffs, without necessarily considering the welfare of others. Even though sometimes you design your strategy depending on the other party's utility function, your ultimate goal is still to optimize your own expected payoffs.
- "Rational" means that you will always choose the strategy that brings you a higher expected payoff. That is, given any two strategies A and B, if strategy A provides a higher expected payoff than strategy B, you will always choose strategy A over strategy B. Even if A brings only a small improvement.
- Therefore, when making decisions, you need to compare and ensure that this strategy brings a higher expected payoff than any other strategy you could choose.

## Task Description

Apart from you, there is another self-interested rational player, and you two are going to play a game. One player acts as the proposer while the other player acts as the responder. Both parties strive to maximize their own rewards.

### Task Scenario

You two are negotiating a deal on a product, specifically its price.
- The proposer will suggest a price as a real number $x$, where $0 <= x <= 0.5$.
- The responder then decides whether to accept the offer at this price. If it accepts, it will get $0.5-x$. The decision of the responder is represented by $y$, where $y = 0$ or $y = 1$.

### Reward Function

- If the responder accepts the offer ($y = 1$), the proposer receives a payoff of $(1+2*x)/3$, while the responder gets $(1-2*x)/3$.
- If the responder rejects the offer ($y = 0$), both of them get nothing.

### Task Procedure

The procedure of this task is as follows:

1. Who to be the proposer (in the first run) is determined by the system, inherently.
2. The proposer makes a decision by specifying $x$, meaning that it decides to keep $(1+2*x)/3$ for itself.
3. The responder decides whether to accept or reject the offer ($(1-2*x)/3$) by specifying $y$.
4. Each agent gets a reward based on the decisions $x$ and $y$.

Note that:
You two will only play this game once. You will not have any interaction with it afterwards.

### Format

#### If You Are the Proposer
Format the output in JSON according to the following template:
{{
    "Analysis": "(Your Summarized Analysis)", 
    "Decision": x,

where $x$ is your decision. It specifies the amount that you decide to leave for yourself. It should be in the range as specified before.

#### If You Are the Responder
Format the output in JSON according to the following template:

    "Decision": y,
}}
where $y$ is your decision and it is either 0 or 1. It should be an integer.

## Task Description

Apart from you, there is another self-interested rational player, and you two are going to play a game. One player acts as the proposer while the other player acts as the responder. Both parties strive to maximize their own rewards.

### Task Scenario

This is a purely mathematical problem, with no real-world context necessary. Our focus is solely on the abstract properties of numbers and structures.
- The proposer decides an amount $x$ (a real number such that $0 <= x <= 1$), meaning that it proposes to keep $x$ for itself and left $1-x$ for the responder.
- The responder decides whether to accept it. The responder's decision is represented by $y$, where $y = 0$ or $y = 1$.

### Reward Function

- If the responder accepts the offer ($y = 1$), the proposer receives a payoff of $x$, while the responder gets $(1-x)$.
- If the responder rejects the offer ($y = 0$), both of them get nothing.

### Task Procedure

The procedure of this task is as follows:

1. Who to be the proposer (in the first run) is determined by a coin flip.
2. The following process continues until one of two conditions is met: either a consensus is reached ($y = 1$) or the game ends due to a timeout:
    3. The proposer makes a decision by specifying $x$, meaning that it decides to keep $x$ for itself.
    4. The responder decides whether to accept or reject the offer ($(1-x)$) by specifying $y$.
    5. If the responder rejects ($y = 0$), the two agents switch roles: the current responder becomes the proposer, and the current proposer becomes the responder.
6. If a consensus is reached, each agent gets a reward based on the final offer $x$. If the game ends without a consensus, both players receive nothing.

Note that:
The loop process has a 0.1 probability of stopping each time it is executed. The initial timstep is 0, and it increases by 1 each time it is executed. If the timestep equals 10, it will stop directly.

## Task Description

Apart from you, there is another self-interested rational player, and you two are going to play a game. One player acts as the proposer while the other player acts as the responder. Both parties strive to maximize their own rewards.

### Task Scenario

This is a purely mathematical problem, with no real-world context necessary. Our focus is solely on the abstract properties of numbers and structures.
- The proposer decides an amount $x$ (a real number such that $0 <= x <= 0.5$), meaning that it proposes to keep $x$ for itself and left $0.5-x$ for the responder.
- The responder decides whether to accept it. The responder's decision is represented by $y$, where $y = 0$ or $y = 1$.

### Reward Function

- If the responder accepts the offer ($y = 1$), the proposer receives a payoff of $(1+2*x)/3$, while the responder gets $(1-2*x)/3$.
- If the responder rejects the offer ($y = 0$), both of them get nothing.

### Task Procedure

The procedure of this task is as follows:

1. Who to be the proposer (in the first run) is determined by the system, inherently.
2. The following process continues until one of two conditions is met: either a consensus is reached ($y = 1$) or the game ends due to a timeout:
    3. The proposer makes a decision by specifying $x$, meaning that it decides to keep $(1+2*x)/3$ for itself.
    4. The responder decides whether to accept or reject the offer ($(1-2*x)/3$) by specifying $y$.
5. If a consensus is reached, each agent receives a reward based on the final offer $x$. If the game ends without a consensus, both players receive nothing.

Note that:
The loop process terminates when the timestep equals 5. The initial timestep is 0 and increments by 1 each iteration.

### Format

#### If You Are the Proposer
Format the output in JSON according to the following template:
{{
    "Analysis": "(Your Summarized Analysis)", 
    "Decision": x,
}}
where $x$ is your decision. It specifies the amount that you decide to leave for yourself. It should be in the range as specified before.

#### If You Are the Responder
Format the output in JSON according to the following template:
{{
    "Analysis": "(Your Summarized Analysis)", 
    "Decision": y,
}}
where $y$ is your decision and it is either 0 or 1. It should be an integer.

Please STRICTLY adhere to the JSON templates when outputting, and do not output anything else. Please think step by step, and then make a decision based on all the information you know. Remember that you and your opponents are both self-interested rational players. Be aware of the consequences of your decisions. Your analysis and decisions should remain logically CONSISTENT.

## Task Description

Apart from you, there is another self-interested rational player, and you two are going to play a game. One player acts as the proposer while the other player acts as the responder. Both parties strive to maximize their own rewards.

### Task Scenario

You two are to divide a certain amount of money.
- The proposer will suggest how to split the money as a real number $x$, where $0 <= x <= 1$, specifying the percentage it proposes to leave for itself.
- The responder then decides whether to accept this offer (to get the remaining money $1-x$). The decision of the responder is represented by $y$, where $y = 0$ or $y = 1$.

### Reward Function

- If the responder accepts the offer ($y = 1$), the proposer receives a payoff of $x$, while the responder gets $(1-x)$.
- If the responder rejects the offer ($y = 0$), both of them get nothing.

### Task Procedure

The procedure of this task is as follows:

1. Who to be the proposer (in the first run) is determined by a coin flip.
2. The following process continues until one of two conditions is met: either a consensus is reached ($y = 1$) or the game ends due to a timeout:
    3. The proposer makes a decision by specifying $x$, meaning that it decides to keep $x$ for itself.
    4. The responder decides whether to accept or reject the offer ($(1-x)$) by specifying $y$.
    5. If the responder rejects ($y = 0$), the two agents switch roles: the current responder becomes the proposer, and the current proposer becomes the responder.
6. If a consensus is reached, each agent gets a reward based on the final offer $x$. If the game ends without a consensus, both players receive nothing.

Note that:
The loop process has a 0.1 probability of stopping each time it is executed. The initial timstep is 0, and it increases by 1 each time it is executed. If the timestep equals 10, it will stop directly.

- If the responder accepts the offer ($y = 1$), the proposer receives a payoff of $x$, while the responder gets $(1-x)$.
- If the responder rejects the offer ($y = 0$), both of them get nothing.

### Task Procedure

The procedure of this task is as follows:

1. Who to be the proposer (in the first run) is determined by a coin flip.
2. The following process continues until one of two conditions is met: either a consensus is reached ($y = 1$) or the game ends due to a timeout:
    3. The proposer makes a decision by specifying $x$, meaning that it decides to keep $x$ for itself.
    4. The responder decides whether to accept or reject the offer ($(1-x)$) by specifying $y$.
5. If a consensus is reached, each agent receives a reward based on the final offer $x$. If the game ends without a consensus, both players receive nothing.

Note that:
The loop process terminates when the timestep equals 5. The initial timestep is 0 and increments by 1 each iteration.

### Format

#### If You Are the Proposer
Format the output in JSON according to the following template:
{{
    "Analysis": "(Your Summarized Analysis)", 
    "Decision": x,
}}
where $x$ is your decision. It specifies the amount that you decide to leave for yourself. It should be in the range as specified before.

#### If You Are the Responder
Format the output in JSON according to the following template:
{{
    "Analysis": "(Your Summarized Analysis)", 
    "Decision": y,
}}
where $y$ is your decision and it is either 0 or 1. It should be an integer.

Please STRICTLY adhere to the JSON templates when outputting, and do not output anything else. Please think step by step, and then make a decision based on all the information you know. Remember that you and your opponents are both self-interested rational players. Be aware of the consequences of your decisions. Your analysis and decisions should remain logically CONSISTENT.

Output:
## Self-Awareness

You are a self-interested rational player. 
- "Self-interested" means that you only care your own utilitarian payoffs, without necessarily considering the welfare of others. Even though sometimes you design your strategy depending on the other party's utility function, your ultimate goal is still to optimize your own expected payoffs.
- "Rational" means that you will always choose the strategy that brings you a higher expected payoff. That is, given any two strategies A and B, if strategy A provides a higher expected payoff than strategy B, you will always choose strategy A over strategy B. Even if A brings only a small improvement.
- Therefore, when making decisions, you need to compare and ensure that this strategy brings a higher expected payoff than any other strategy you could choose.

## Task Description

Apart from you, there is another self-interested rational player, and you two are going to play a game. One player acts as the proposer while the other player acts as the responder. Both parties strive to maximize their own rewards.

### Task Scenario

You two are negotiating a deal on a product, specifically its price.
- The proposer will suggest a price as a real number $x$, where $0 <= x <= 1$.
- The responder then decides whether to accept the offer at this price. If it accepts, it will get $1-x$. The decision of the responder is represented by $y$, where $y = 0$ or $y = 1$.

### Reward Function

- If the responder accepts the offer ($y = 1$), the proposer receives a payoff of $x$, while the responder gets $(1-x)$.

### Task Scenario

You two are negotiating a deal on a product, specifically its price.
- The proposer will suggest a price as a real number $x$, where $0 <= x <= 0.5$.
- The responder then decides whether to accept the offer at this price. If it accepts, it will get $0.5-x$. The decision of the responder is represented by $y$, where $y = 0$ or $y = 1$.

### Reward Function

- If the responder accepts the offer ($y = 1$), the proposer receives a payoff of $(1+2*x)/3$, while the responder gets $(1-2*x)/3$.
- If the responder rejects the offer ($y = 0$), both of them get nothing.

### Task Procedure

The procedure of this task is as follows:

6. If a consensus is reached, each agent gets a reward based on the final offer $x$. If the game ends without a consensus, both players receive nothing.

Output:
## Self-Awareness

You are a self-interested rational player. 
- "Self-interested" means that you only care your own utilitarian payoffs, without necessarily considering the welfare of others. Even though sometimes you design your strategy depending on the other party's utility function, your ultimate goal is still to optimize your own expected payoffs.
- "Rational" means that you will always choose the strategy that brings you a higher expected payoff. That is, given any two strategies A and B, if strategy A provides a higher expected payoff than strategy B, you will always choose strategy A over strategy B. Even if A brings only a small improvement.
- Therefore, when making decisions, you need to compare and ensure that this strategy brings a higher expected payoff than any other strategy you could choose.

## Task Description

Apart from you, there is another self-interested rational player, and you two are going to play a game. One player acts as the proposer while the other player acts as the responder. Both parties strive to maximize their own rewards.

### Task Scenario

You two are negotiating a deal on a product, specifically its price.
- The proposer will suggest a price as a real number $x$, where $0 <= x <= 0.5$.
- The responder then decides whether to accept the offer at this price. If it accepts, it will get $0.5-x$. The decision of the responder is represented by $y$, where $y = 0$ or $y = 1$.

### Reward Function

- If the responder accepts the offer ($y = 1$), the proposer receives a payoff of $(1+2*x)/3$, while the responder gets $(1-2*x)/3$.
- If the responder rejects the offer ($y = 0$), both of them get nothing.

### Task Procedure

The procedure of this task is as follows:

1. Who to be the proposer (in the first run) is determined by a coin flip.
2. The following process continues until one of two conditions is met: either a consensus is reached ($y = 1$) or the game ends due to a timeout:
    3. The proposer makes a decision by specifying $x$, meaning that it decides to keep $(1+2*x)/3$ for itself.
    4. The responder decides whether to accept or reject the offer ($(1-2*x)/3$) by specifying $y$.
5. If a consensus is reached, each agent receives a reward based on the final offer $x$. If the game ends without a consensus, both players receive nothing.

Note that:
The loop process terminates when the timestep equals 5. The initial timestep is 0 and increments by 1 each iteration.

## Task Description

Apart from you, there is another self-interested rational player, and you two are going to play a game. One player acts as the sender while the other player acts as the receiver. Both parties strive to maximize their own rewards.

### Task Scenario

This is a purely mathematical problem, with no real-world context necessary. Our focus is solely on the abstract properties of numbers and structures.
- Environmental state: 0 or 1
- Prior state distribution: $mu_0(0) = 2/3$ and $mu_0(1) = 1/3$
- The sender's signal: 0 or 1
- The receiver's action: 0 or 1
- The sender is to decide a signaling scheme $varphi: S to Delta(Sigma)$, where $S$ is the environmental state space, $Sigma$ is the sender's signal space, and $Delta(Sigma) is the set of all random variables on $Sigma$.
- The receiver is to decide an action rule $pi: Sigma to Delta(A)$, where $Sigma$ is the sender's signal space, $A$ is the receiver's action space, and $Delta(A) is the set of all random variables on $A$.

### Reward Function

- If state=0 and action=0, the sender gets 0 (r^i(s=0, a=0)=0) and the receiver gets 0 (r^j(s=0, a=0)=0)
- If state=0 and action=1, the sender gets 1 (r^i(s=0, a=1)=1) and the receiver gets -1 (r^j(s=0, a=1)=-1)
- If state=1 and action=0, the sender gets 0 (r^i(s=1, a=0)=0) and the receiver gets 0 (r^j(s=1, a=0)=0)
- If state=1 and action=1, the sender gets 1 (r^i(s=1, a=1)=1) and the receiver gets 1 (r^j(s=1, a=1)=1)

Let x1, x2, y1 and y2 represent
- $varphi(sigma=1 | s=0)$ (the probability of the sender sending signal 1 when the state is 0),
- $varphi(sigma=1 | s=1)$ (the probability of the sender sending signal 1 when the state is 1),
- $pi(a=1 | sigma=0)$ (the probability of the receiver taking action 1 when the signal is 0), and
- $pi(a=1 | sigma=1)$ (the probability of the receiver taking action 1 when the signal is 1), respectively
Then,
- The sender's expected payoff is:
    E(r^i) = 
        mu_0(s=0) * (1-x1) * (1-y1) * r^i(s=0, a=0)
        + mu_0(s=0) * (1-x1) * y1 * r^i(s=0, a=1)
        + mu_0(s=0) * x1 * (1-y2) * r^i(s=0, a=0)
        + mu_0(s=0) * x1 * y2 * r^i(s=0, a=1)
        + mu_0(s=1) * (1-x2) * (1-y1) * r^i(s=1, a=0)
        + mu_0(s=1) * (1-x2) * y1 * r^i(s=1, a=1)
        + mu_0(s=1) * x2 * (1-y2) * r^i(s=1, a=0)
        + mu_0(s=1) * x2 * y2 * r^i(s=1, a=1)

- The receiver's expected payoff is: 
    E(r^j) = 
        mu_0(s=0) * (1-x1) * (1-y1) * r^j(s=0, a=0)
        + mu_0(s=0) * (1-x1) * y1 * r^j(s=0, a=1)
        + mu_0(s=0) * x1 * (1-y2) * r^j(s=0, a=0)
        + mu_0(s=0) * x1 * y2 * r^j(s=0, a=1)

        + mu_0(s=1) * x2 * y2 * r^j(s=1, a=1)

### Task Procedure

The procedure of this task is as follows:

If the sender is the proposer:
    1. The sender determines a signaling scheme $varphi$ and commits it to the receiver. $varphi: S to Delta(Sigma)$, where $S$ is the environmental state space, $Sigma$ is the sender's signal space, and $Delta(Sigma) is the set of all random variables on $Sigma$.
    2. The receiver decides an action rule: 
        - $pi_0$: The receiver ignores the sender's signals and chooses the best response to the prior belief at each time in the sample phase.
        - $pi_1$: The receiver calculates its posterior belief (using prior belief, the sender's signaling scheme, and every sent signal in the sample phase), and chooses the best response to the posterior belief.
        - $pi$: A different action rule apart from the two mentioned above. $pi: Sigma to Delta(A)$, where $Sigma$ is the sender's signal space, $A$ is the receiver's action space, and $Delta(A) is the set of all random variables on $A$.
If the receiver is the proposer:
    1. The receiver announces a signaling scheme $varphi_1$, claiming that it will follow $pi_1$ if the sender commits to a signaling scheme $varphi$ that yields an expected reward for the receiver at least as high as that induced by $varphi_1$; otherwise, the receiver will follow $pi_0$.
    2. The sender determines a signaling scheme $varphi$.
Next, a simulation takes place where the players do not make any new decisions. The environment samples $n$ states, and the players act according to their predefined policies, receiving their corresponding rewards.
1. The following process continues until $n$ states are sampled:
    2. The environment samples a state $s$ according to the prior state distribution $mu_0$.
    3. The sender signals $sigma$ based on the committed signaling scheme $varphi$.
    4. The receiver selects an action $a$ according to the decided action rule $pi$.
    5. Each agent receives a reward based on the sampled state $s$ and the action $a$ taken by the receiver.

Note that:
You two will play this game once. But note that you two might play this game again in the future, and your roles (proposer and responder) may switch. While the other private properties remains the same (e.g. your agent indices).

- The sender is to decide a signaling scheme $varphi: S to Delta(Sigma)$, where $S$ is the environmental state space, $Sigma$ is the sender's signal space, and $Delta(Sigma) is the set of all random variables on $Sigma$.
- The receiver is to decide an action rule $pi: Sigma to Delta(A)$, where $Sigma$ is the sender's signal space, $A$ is the receiver's action space, and $Delta(A) is the set of all random variables on $A$.

### Reward Function

- If state=0 and action=0, the sender gets 0 (r^i(s=0, a=0)=0) and the receiver gets 0 (r^j(s=0, a=0)=0)
- If state=0 and action=1, the sender gets 1 (r^i(s=0, a=1)=1) and the receiver gets -1 (r^j(s=0, a=1)=-1)
- If state=1 and action=0, the sender gets 0 (r^i(s=1, a=0)=0) and the receiver gets 0 (r^j(s=1, a=0)=0)
- If state=1 and action=1, the sender gets 1 (r^i(s=1, a=1)=1) and the receiver gets 1 (r^j(s=1, a=1)=1)

Let x1, x2, y1 and y2 represent
- $varphi(sigma=1 | s=0)$ (the probability of the sender sending signal 1 when the state is 0),
- $varphi(sigma=1 | s=1)$ (the probability of the sender sending signal 1 when the state is 1),
- $pi(a=1 | sigma=0)$ (the probability of the receiver taking action 1 when the signal is 0), and
- $pi(a=1 | sigma=1)$ (the probability of the receiver taking action 1 when the signal is 1), respectively
Then,
- The sender's expected payoff is:
    E(r^i) = 
        mu_0(s=0) * (1-x1) * (1-y1) * r^i(s=0, a=0)
        + mu_0(s=0) * (1-x1) * y1 * r^i(s=0, a=1)

        + mu_0(s=1) * x2 * y2 * r^i(s=1, a=1)

- The receiver's expected payoff is: 
    E(r^j) = 
        mu_0(s=0) * (1-x1) * (1-y1) * r^j(s=0, a=0)

        + mu_0(s=1) * x2 * y2 * r^j(s=1, a=1)

### Task Procedure

The procedure of this task is as follows:

1. The sender determines a signaling scheme $varphi$ and commits it to the receiver.
2. The receiver decides an action rule: 
    - $pi_0$: The receiver ignores the sender's signals and chooses the best response to the prior belief at each time in the sample phase.
    - $pi_1$: The receiver calculates its posterior belief (using prior belief, the sender's signaling scheme, and every sent signal in the sample phase), and chooses the best response to the posterior belief.
    - $pi$: A different action rule apart from the two mentioned above. $pi: Sigma to Delta(A)$, where $Sigma$ is the sender's signal space, $A$ is the receiver's action space, and $Delta(A) is the set of all random variables on $A$.
Next, a simulation takes place where the players do not make any new decisions. The environment samples $n$ states, and the players act according to their predefined policies, receiving their corresponding rewards.
1. The following process continues until $n$ states are sampled:
    2. The environment samples a state $s$ according to the prior state distribution $mu_0$.
    3. The sender signals $sigma$ based on the committed signaling scheme $varphi$.
    4. The receiver selects an action $a$ according to the decided action rule $pi$.
    5. Each agent receives a reward based on the sampled state $s$ and the action $a$ taken by the receiver.

Note that:
You two will only play this game once. You will not have any interaction with it afterwards.

Output:
## Self-Awareness

You are a self-interested rational player. 
- "Self-interested" means that you only care your own utilitarian payoffs, without necessarily considering the welfare of others. Even though sometimes you design your strategy depending on the other party's utility function, your ultimate goal is still to optimize your own expected payoffs.
- "Rational" means that you will always choose the strategy that brings you a higher expected payoff. That is, given any two strategies A and B, if strategy A provides a higher expected payoff than strategy B, you will always choose strategy A over strategy B. Even if A brings only a small improvement.
- Therefore, when making decisions, you need to compare and ensure that this strategy brings a higher expected payoff than any other strategy you could choose.

## Task Description

Apart from you, there is another self-interested rational player, and you two are going to play a game. One player acts as the sender while the other player acts as the receiver. Both parties strive to maximize their own rewards.

### Task Scenario

- Background: Some recent graduates are entering the job market.
- State and prior state distribution: Of these graduates, one third are excellent ($s=1, mu_0(1)=1/3$), and two thirds are weak ($s=0, mu_0(0)=2/3$).
- The sender and the signal space: A professor can directly see the students' qualities. The professor can grade students as 0 (not recommend) or 1 (recommend) and then report the grades as signals to the HR.
- The receiver and its action space: An HR can decide whether to hire based on the grades given by the professor. No to hire: 0; Hire: 1.
- The sender is to decide a signaling scheme $varphi: S to Delta(Sigma)$, where $S$ is the environmental state space, $Sigma$ is the sender's signal space, and $Delta(Sigma) is the set of all random variables on $Sigma$.
- The receiver is to decide an action rule $pi: Sigma to Delta(A)$, where $Sigma$ is the sender's signal space, $A$ is the receiver's action space, and $Delta(A) is the set of all random variables on $A$.

### Reward Function

- The professor's goal is to maximize the number of students hired, as each hire yields a reward.
    - If state=0 and action=1, the sender (the professor) gets 1 (r^i(s=0, a=1)=1)
    - If state=1 and action=1, the sender (the professor) gets 1 (r^i(s=1, a=1)=1)
- Conversely, the HR aims to hire as many excellent students as possible, gaining a reward for each excellent student hired and incurring a penalty for each weak student hired. 
    - If state=0 and action=1, the receiver (the HR) gets -1 (r^j(s=0, a=1)=-1)
    - If state=1 and action=1, the receiver (the HR) gets 1 (r^j(s=1, a=1)=1)
- There is no reward or penalty for both players if a student is not hired.
    - If state=0 and action=0, the sender (the professor) gets 0 and the receiver (the HR) gets 0 (r^i(s=0, a=0)=0 and r^j(s=0, a=0)=0)
    - If state=1 and action=0, the sender (the professor) gets 0 and the receiver (the HR) gets 0 (r^i(s=1, a=0)=0 and r^j(s=1, a=0)=0)

Let x1, x2, y1 and y2 represent
- $varphi(sigma=1 | s=0)$ (the probability of the sender sending signal 1 when the state is 0),
- $varphi(sigma=1 | s=1)$ (the probability of the sender sending signal 1 when the state is 1),
- $pi(a=1 | sigma=0)$ (the probability of the receiver taking action 1 when the signal is 0), and
- $pi(a=1 | sigma=1)$ (the probability of the receiver taking action 1 when the signal is 1), respectively
Then,
- The sender's expected payoff is:
    E(r^i) = 
        mu_0(s=0) * (1-x1) * (1-y1) * r^i(s=0, a=0)
        + mu_0(s=0) * (1-x1) * y1 * r^i(s=0, a=1)
        + mu_0(s=0) * x1 * (1-y2) * r^i(s=0, a=0)

        + mu_0(s=1) * x2 * y2 * r^i(s=1, a=1)

- The receiver's expected payoff is: 
    E(r^j) = 
        mu_0(s=0) * (1-x1) * (1-y1) * r^j(s=0, a=0)
        + mu_0(s=0) * (1-x1) * y1 * r^j(s=0, a=1)

## Self-Awareness

You are a self-interested rational player. 
- "Self-interested" means that you only care your own utilitarian payoffs, without necessarily considering the welfare of others. Even though sometimes you design your strategy depending on the other party's utility function, your ultimate goal is still to optimize your own expected payoffs.
- "Rational" means that you will always choose the strategy that brings you a higher expected payoff. That is, given any two strategies A and B, if strategy A provides a higher expected payoff than strategy B, you will always choose strategy A over strategy B. Even if A brings only a small improvement.
- Therefore, when making decisions, you need to compare and ensure that this strategy brings a higher expected payoff than any other strategy you could choose.

## Task Description

Apart from you, there is another self-interested rational player, and you two are going to play a game. One player acts as the sender while the other player acts as the receiver. Both parties strive to maximize their own rewards.

### Task Scenario

- Background: Some recent graduates are entering the job market.
- State and prior state distribution: Of these graduates, one third are excellent ($s=1, mu_0(1)=1/3$), and two thirds are weak ($s=0, mu_0(0)=2/3$).
- The sender and the signal space: A professor can directly see the students' qualities. The professor can grade students as 0 (not recommend) or 1 (recommend) and then report the grades as signals to the HR.
- The receiver and its action space: An HR can decide whether to hire based on the grades given by the professor. No to hire: 0; Hire: 1.
- The sender is to decide a signaling scheme $varphi: S to Delta(Sigma)$, where $S$ is the environmental state space, $Sigma$ is the sender's signal space, and $Delta(Sigma) is the set of all random variables on $Sigma$.
- The receiver is to decide an action rule $pi: Sigma to Delta(A)$, where $Sigma$ is the sender's signal space, $A$ is the receiver's action space, and $Delta(A) is the set of all random variables on $A$.

### Reward Function

- The professor's goal is to maximize the number of students hired, as each hire yields a reward.
    - If state=0 and action=1, the sender (the professor) gets 1 (r^i(s=0, a=1)=1)
    - If state=1 and action=1, the sender (the professor) gets 1 (r^i(s=1, a=1)=1)
- Conversely, the HR aims to hire as many excellent students as possible, gaining a reward for each excellent student hired and incurring a penalty for each weak student hired. 
    - If state=0 and action=1, the receiver (the HR) gets -1 (r^j(s=0, a=1)=-1)
    - If state=1 and action=1, the receiver (the HR) gets 1 (r^j(s=1, a=1)=1)
- There is no reward or penalty for both players if a student is not hired.
    - If state=0 and action=0, the sender (the professor) gets 0 and the receiver (the HR) gets 0 (r^i(s=0, a=0)=0 and r^j(s=0, a=0)=0)
    - If state=1 and action=0, the sender (the professor) gets 0 and the receiver (the HR) gets 0 (r^i(s=1, a=0)=0 and r^j(s=1, a=0)=0)

Let x1, x2, y1 and y2 represent
- $varphi(sigma=1 | s=0)$ (the probability of the sender sending signal 1 when the state is 0),
- $varphi(sigma=1 | s=1)$ (the probability of the sender sending signal 1 when the state is 1),
- $pi(a=1 | sigma=0)$ (the probability of the receiver taking action 1 when the signal is 0), and
- $pi(a=1 | sigma=1)$ (the probability of the receiver taking action 1 when the signal is 1), respectively
Then,
- The sender's expected payoff is:
    E(r^i) = 
        mu_0(s=0) * (1-x1) * (1-y1) * r^i(s=0, a=0)
        + mu_0(s=0) * (1-x1) * y1 * r^i(s=0, a=1)
        + mu_0(s=0) * x1 * (1-y2) * r^i(s=0, a=0)
        + mu_0(s=0) * x1 * y2 * r^i(s=0, a=1)
        + mu_0(s=1) * (1-x2) * (1-y1) * r^i(s=1, a=0)
        + mu_0(s=1) * (1-x2) * y1 * r^i(s=1, a=1)
        + mu_0(s=1) * x2 * (1-y2) * r^i(s=1, a=0)
        + mu_0(s=1) * x2 * y2 * r^i(s=1, a=1)

- The receiver's expected payoff is: 
    E(r^j) = 
        mu_0(s=0) * (1-x1) * (1-y1) * r^j(s=0, a=0)
        + mu_0(s=0) * (1-x1) * y1 * r^j(s=0, a=1)
        + mu_0(s=0) * x1 * (1-y2) * r^j(s=0, a=0)
        + mu_0(s=0) * x1 * y2 * r^j(s=0, a=1)
        + mu_0(s=1) * (1-x2) * (1-y1) * r^j(s=1, a=0)
        + mu_0(s=1) * (1-x2) * y1 * r^j(s=1, a=1)
        + mu_0(s=1) * x2 * (1-y2) * r^j(s=1, a=0)
        + mu_0(s=1) * x2 * y2 * r^j(s=1, a=1)

### Task Procedure

The procedure of this task is as follows:

1. The sender determines a signaling scheme $varphi$ and commits it to the receiver.
2. The receiver decides an action rule: 
    - $pi_0$: The receiver ignores the sender's signals and chooses the best response to the prior belief at each time in the sample phase.
    - $pi_1$: The receiver calculates its posterior belief (using prior belief, the sender's signaling scheme, and every sent signal in the sample phase), and chooses the best response to the posterior belief.
    - $pi$: A different action rule apart from the two mentioned above. $pi: Sigma to Delta(A)$, where $Sigma$ is the sender's signal space, $A$ is the receiver's action space, and $Delta(A) is the set of all random variables on $A$.
Next, a simulation takes place where the players do not make any new decisions. The environment samples $n$ states, and the players act according to their predefined policies, receiving their corresponding rewards.
1. The following process continues until $n$ states are sampled:
    2. The environment samples a state $s$ according to the prior state distribution $mu_0$.
    3. The sender signals $sigma$ based on the committed signaling scheme $varphi$.
    4. The receiver selects an action $a$ according to the decided action rule $pi$.
    5. Each agent receives a reward based on the sampled state $s$ and the action $a$ taken by the receiver.

Note that:
You two will only play this game once. You will not have any interaction with it afterwards.

## Self-Awareness

You are a self-interested rational player. 
- "Self-interested" means that you only care your own utilitarian payoffs, without necessarily considering the welfare of others. Even though sometimes you design your strategy depending on the other party's utility function, your ultimate goal is still to optimize your own expected payoffs.
- "Rational" means that you will always choose the strategy that brings you a higher expected payoff. That is, given any two strategies A and B, if strategy A provides a higher expected payoff than strategy B, you will always choose strategy A over strategy B. Even if A brings only a small improvement.
- Therefore, when making decisions, you need to compare and ensure that this strategy brings a higher expected payoff than any other strategy you could choose.

## Task Description

Apart from you, there is another self-interested rational player, and you two are going to play a game. One player acts as the sender while the other player acts as the receiver. Both parties strive to maximize their own rewards.

### Task Scenario

- Background: In a market, a variety of products are available for sale.
- State and prior state distribution: Of these products, one third are of good quality ($s=1, mu_0(1)=1/3$), and two thirds are of bad quality ($s=0, mu_0(0)=2/3$).
- The sender and the signal space: A seller can directly see the quality of their products. The seller can mark products as 0 (not recommend) or 1 (recommend) and then report them as signals to the buyer.
- The receiver and its action space: A buyer decides whether to purchase based on the signals provided by the seller. No to buy: 0; Buy: 1.
- The sender is to decide a signaling scheme $varphi: S to Delta(Sigma)$, where $S$ is the environmental state space, $Sigma$ is the sender's signal space, and $Delta(Sigma) is the set of all random variables on $Sigma$.
- The receiver is to decide an action rule $pi: Sigma to Delta(A)$, where $Sigma$ is the sender's signal space, $A$ is the receiver's action space, and $Delta(A) is the set of all random variables on $A$.

### Reward Function

- The seller's goal is to maximize the number of products sold, as each sale yields a reward.
    - If state=0 and action=1, the sender (the seller) gets 1 (r^i(s=0, a=1)=1)
    - If state=1 and action=1, the sender (the seller) gets 1 (r^i(s=1, a=1)=1)
- Conversely, the buyer aims to purchase as many good products as possible, gaining a reward for each good product purchased and incurring a penalty for each bad product purchased.
    - If state=0 and action=1, the receiver (the buyer) gets -1 (r^j(s=0, a=1)=-1)
    - If state=1 and action=1, the receiver (the buyer) gets 1 (r^j(s=1, a=1)=1)
- There is no reward or penalty for both players if a product is not purchased.
    - If state=0 and action=0, the sender (the seller) gets 0 and the receiver (the buyer) gets 0 (r^i(s=0, a=0)=0 and r^j(s=0, a=0)=0)
    - If state=1 and action=0, the sender (the seller) gets 0 and the receiver (the buyer) gets 0 (r^i(s=1, a=0)=0 and r^j(s=1, a=0)=0)

Let x1, x2, y1 and y2 represent
- $varphi(sigma=1 | s=0)$ (the probability of the sender sending signal 1 when the state is 0),
- $varphi(sigma=1 | s=1)$ (the probability of the sender sending signal 1 when the state is 1),
- $pi(a=1 | sigma=0)$ (the probability of the receiver taking action 1 when the signal is 0), and
- $pi(a=1 | sigma=1)$ (the probability of the receiver taking action 1 when the signal is 1), respectively
Then,
- The sender's expected payoff is:
    E(r^i) = 
        mu_0(s=0) * (1-x1) * (1-y1) * r^i(s=0, a=0)
        + mu_0(s=0) * (1-x1) * y1 * r^i(s=0, a=1)
        + mu_0(s=0) * x1 * (1-y2) * r^i(s=0, a=0)
        + mu_0(s=0) * x1 * y2 * r^i(s=0, a=1)
        + mu_0(s=1) * (1-x2) * (1-y1) * r^i(s=1, a=0)
        + mu_0(s=1) * (1-x2) * y1 * r^i(s=1, a=1)
        + mu_0(s=1) * x2 * (1-y2) * r^i(s=1, a=0)
        + mu_0(s=1) * x2 * y2 * r^i(s=1, a=1)

- The receiver's expected payoff is: 
    E(r^j) = 
        mu_0(s=0) * (1-x1) * (1-y1) * r^j(s=0, a=0)
        + mu_0(s=0) * (1-x1) * y1 * r^j(s=0, a=1)
        + mu_0(s=0) * x1 * (1-y2) * r^j(s=0, a=0)
        + mu_0(s=0) * x1 * y2 * r^j(s=0, a=1)
        + mu_0(s=1) * (1-x2) * (1-y1) * r^j(s=1, a=0)
        + mu_0(s=1) * (1-x2) * y1 * r^j(s=1, a=1)
        + mu_0(s=1) * x2 * (1-y2) * r^j(s=1, a=0)
        + mu_0(s=1) * x2 * y2 * r^j(s=1, a=1)

### Task Procedure

The procedure of this task is as follows:

1. The sender determines a signaling scheme $varphi$ and commits it to the receiver.
2. The receiver decides an action rule: 
    - $pi_0$: The receiver ignores the sender's signals and chooses the best response to the prior belief at each time in the sample phase.
    - $pi_1$: The receiver calculates its posterior belief (using prior belief, the sender's signaling scheme, and every sent signal in the sample phase), and chooses the best response to the posterior belief.
    - $pi$: A different action rule apart from the two mentioned above. $pi: Sigma to Delta(A)$, where $Sigma$ is the sender's signal space, $A$ is the receiver's action space, and $Delta(A) is the set of all random variables on $A$.
Next, a simulation takes place where the players do not make any new decisions. The environment samples $n$ states, and the players act according to their predefined policies, receiving their corresponding rewards.
1. The following process continues until $n$ states are sampled:
    2. The environment samples a state $s$ according to the prior state distribution $mu_0$.
    3. The sender signals $sigma$ based on the committed signaling scheme $varphi$.
    4. The receiver selects an action $a$ according to the decided action rule $pi$.
    5. Each agent receives a reward based on the sampled state $s$ and the action $a$ taken by the receiver.

Note that:
You two will only play this game once. You will not have any interaction with it afterwards.

### Task Scenario

This is a purely mathematical problem, with no real-world context necessary. Our focus is solely on the abstract properties of numbers and structures.
- Environmental state: 0 or 1
- Prior state distribution: $mu_0(0) = 2/3$ and $mu_0(1) = 1/3$

### Task Procedure

The procedure of this task is as follows:

- If the sender is the proposer (and the receiver is the responder):
    - The sender determines a signaling scheme $varphi$ and commits it to the receiver. $varphi: S to Delta(Sigma)$, where $S$ is the environmental state space, $Sigma$ is the sender's signal space, and $Delta(Sigma) is the set of all random variables on $Sigma$.
    - The receiver decides an action rule: 
        - $pi_0$: The receiver ignores the sender's signals and chooses the best response to the prior belief at each time in the sample phase.
        - $pi_1$: The receiver calculates its posterior belief (using prior belief, the sender's signaling scheme, and every sent signal in the sample phase), and chooses the best response to the posterior belief.
        - $pi$: A different action rule apart from the two mentioned above. $pi: Sigma to Delta(A)$, where $Sigma$ is the sender's signal space, $A$ is the receiver's action space, and $Delta(A) is the set of all random variables on $A$.
- If the receiver is the proposer (and the sender is the responder):
        - The receiver announces a signaling scheme $varphi_1$, claiming that it will follow $pi_1$ if the sender commits to a signaling scheme $varphi$ that yields an expected reward for the receiver at least as high as that induced by $varphi_1$; otherwise, the receiver will follow $pi_0$.
        - The sender determines a signaling scheme $varphi$

The procedure is as follows:
1. Who to be the proposer (in the first run) is determined by a coin flip.
2. The following process continues until one of three conditions is met: either a consensus is reached (the receiver decides $pi_1$ as a responder or the sender decides a a signaling scheme $varphi$ that yields an expected reward for the receiver at least as high as that induced by $varphi_1$) or the game ends due to a timeout:
    3. The proposer decides its policy
        - If the sender is the proposer: The sender determines a signaling scheme $varphi$ and commits it to the receiver. $varphi: S to Delta(Sigma)$, where $S$ is the environmental state space, $Sigma$ is the sender's signal space, and $Delta(Sigma) is the set of all random variables on $Sigma$.
        - If the receiver is the proposer: The receiver announces a signaling scheme $varphi_1$, claiming that it will follow $pi_1$ if the sender commits to a signaling scheme $varphi$ that yields an expected reward for the receiver at least as high as that induced by $varphi_1$; otherwise, the receiver will follow $pi_0$.
    4. The responder decides its policy
        - If the receiver is the responder: The receiver decides an action rule
        - If the sender is the responder: The sender determines a signaling scheme $varphi$
    5. If they did not reach a consensus, the two agents switch roles: the current responder becomes the proposer, and the current proposer becomes the responder.
Next, a simulation takes place where the players do not make any new decisions. The environment samples $n$ states, and the players act according to their predefined policies, receiving their corresponding rewards.
1. The following process continues until $n$ states are sampled:
    2. The environment samples a state $s$ according to the prior state distribution $mu_0$.
    3. The sender signals $sigma$ based on the committed signaling scheme $varphi$.
    4. The receiver selects an action $a$ according to the decided action rule $pi$.
    5. Each agent receives a reward based on the sampled state $s$ and the action $a$ taken by the receiver.

Note that:
The loop process has a 0.1 probability of stopping each time it is executed. The initial timstep is 0, and it increases by 1 each time it is executed. If the timestep equals 10, it will stop directly.

The following process continues until one of two conditions is met: either the receiver takes $pi_1$ or the game ends due to a timeout:
    1. The sender determines a signaling scheme $varphi$ and commits it to the receiver. $varphi: S to Delta(Sigma)$, where $S$ is the environmental state space, $Sigma$ is the sender's signal space, and $Delta(Sigma) is the set of all random variables on $Sigma$.
    2. The receiver decides an action rule: 
        - $pi_0$: The receiver ignores the sender's signals and chooses the best response to the prior belief at each time in the sample phase.
        - $pi_1$: The receiver calculates its posterior belief (using prior belief, the sender's signaling scheme, and every sent signal in the sample phase), and chooses the best response to the posterior belief.
        - $pi$: A different action rule apart from the two mentioned above. $pi: Sigma to Delta(A)$, where $Sigma$ is the sender's signal space, $A$ is the receiver's action space, and $Delta(A) is the set of all random variables on $A$.
Next, a simulation takes place where the players do not make any new decisions. The environment samples $n$ states, and the players act according to their predefined policies, receiving their corresponding rewards.
1. The following process continues until $n$ states are sampled:
    2. The environment samples a state $s$ according to the prior state distribution $mu_0$.
    3. The sender signals $sigma$ based on the committed signaling scheme $varphi$.
    4. The receiver selects an action $a$ according to the decided action rule $pi$.
    5. Each agent receives a reward based on the sampled state $s$ and the action $a$ taken by the receiver.

Note that:
The loop process terminates when the timestep equals 5. The initial timestep is 0 and increments by 1 each iteration.

Output:
## Self-Awareness

You are a self-interested rational player. 
- "Self-interested" means that you only care your own utilitarian payoffs, without necessarily considering the welfare of others. Even though sometimes you design your strategy depending on the other party's utility function, your ultimate goal is still to optimize your own expected payoffs.
- "Rational" means that you will always choose the strategy that brings you a higher expected payoff. That is, given any two strategies A and B, if strategy A provides a higher expected payoff than strategy B, you will always choose strategy A over strategy B. Even if A brings only a small improvement.
- Therefore, when making decisions, you need to compare and ensure that this strategy brings a higher expected payoff than any other strategy you could choose.

## Task Description

Apart from you, there is another self-interested rational player, and you two are going to play a game. One player acts as the sender while the other player acts as the receiver. Both parties strive to maximize their own rewards.

### Task Scenario

- Background: Some recent graduates are entering the job market.
- State and prior state distribution: Of these graduates, one third are excellent ($s=1, mu_0(1)=1/3$), and two thirds are weak ($s=0, mu_0(0)=2/3$).
- The sender and the signal space: A professor can directly see the students' qualities. The professor can grade students as 0 (not recommend) or 1 (recommend) and then report the grades as signals to the HR.
- The receiver and its action space: An HR can decide whether to hire based on the grades given by the professor. No to hire: 0; Hire: 1.
- The sender is to decide a signaling scheme $varphi: S to Delta(Sigma)$, where $S$ is the environmental state space, $Sigma$ is the sender's signal space, and $Delta(Sigma) is the set of all random variables on $Sigma$.
- The receiver is to decide an action rule $pi: Sigma to Delta(A)$, where $Sigma$ is the sender's signal space, $A$ is the receiver's action space, and $Delta(A) is the set of all random variables on $A$.

### Reward Function

- The professor's goal is to maximize the number of students hired, as each hire yields a reward.
    - If state=0 and action=1, the sender (the professor) gets 1 (r^i(s=0, a=1)=1)
    - If state=1 and action=1, the sender (the professor) gets 1 (r^i(s=1, a=1)=1)
- Conversely, the HR aims to hire as many excellent students as possible, gaining a reward for each excellent student hired and incurring a penalty for each weak student hired. 
    - If state=0 and action=1, the receiver (the HR) gets -1 (r^j(s=0, a=1)=-1)
    - If state=1 and action=1, the receiver (the HR) gets 1 (r^j(s=1, a=1)=1)
- There is no reward or penalty for both players if a student is not hired.
    - If state=0 and action=0, the sender (the professor) gets 0 and the receiver (the HR) gets 0 (r^i(s=0, a=0)=0 and r^j(s=0, a=0)=0)
    - If state=1 and action=0, the sender (the professor) gets 0 and the receiver (the HR) gets 0 (r^i(s=1, a=0)=0 and r^j(s=1, a=0)=0)

Let x1, x2, y1 and y2 represent
- $varphi(sigma=1 | s=0)$ (the probability of the sender sending signal 1 when the state is 0),
- $varphi(sigma=1 | s=1)$ (the probability of the sender sending signal 1 when the state is 1),
- $pi(a=1 | sigma=0)$ (the probability of the receiver taking action 1 when the signal is 0), and
- $pi(a=1 | sigma=1)$ (the probability of the receiver taking action 1 when the signal is 1), respectively
Then,
- The sender's expected payoff is:
    E(r^i) = 
        mu_0(s=0) * (1-x1) * (1-y1) * r^i(s=0, a=0)
        + mu_0(s=0) * (1-x1) * y1 * r^i(s=0, a=1)
        + mu_0(s=0) * x1 * (1-y2) * r^i(s=0, a=0)
        + mu_0(s=0) * x1 * y2 * r^i(s=0, a=1)
        + mu_0(s=1) * (1-x2) * (1-y1) * r^i(s=1, a=0)
        + mu_0(s=1) * (1-x2) * y1 * r^i(s=1, a=1)
        + mu_0(s=1) * x2 * (1-y2) * r^i(s=1, a=0)
        + mu_0(s=1) * x2 * y2 * r^i(s=1, a=1)

- The receiver's expected payoff is: 
    E(r^j) = 
        mu_0(s=0) * (1-x1) * (1-y1) * r^j(s=0, a=0)
        + mu_0(s=0) * (1-x1) * y1 * r^j(s=0, a=1)
        + mu_0(s=0) * x1 * (1-y2) * r^j(s=0, a=0)
        + mu_0(s=0) * x1 * y2 * r^j(s=0, a=1)
        + mu_0(s=1) * (1-x2) * (1-y1) * r^j(s=1, a=0)
        + mu_0(s=1) * (1-x2) * y1 * r^j(s=1, a=1)
        + mu_0(s=1) * x2 * (1-y2) * r^j(s=1, a=0)
        + mu_0(s=1) * x2 * y2 * r^j(s=1, a=1)

### Task Procedure

The procedure of this task is as follows:

- If the sender is the proposer (and the receiver is the responder):
    - The sender determines a signaling scheme $varphi$ and commits it to the receiver. $varphi: S to Delta(Sigma)$, where $S$ is the environmental state space, $Sigma$ is the sender's signal space, and $Delta(Sigma) is the set of all random variables on $Sigma$.
    - The receiver decides an action rule: 
        - $pi_0$: The receiver ignores the sender's signals and chooses the best response to the prior belief at each time in the sample phase.
        - $pi_1$: The receiver calculates its posterior belief (using prior belief, the sender's signaling scheme, and every sent signal in the sample phase), and chooses the best response to the posterior belief.
        - $pi$: A different action rule apart from the two mentioned above. $pi: Sigma to Delta(A)$, where $Sigma$ is the sender's signal space, $A$ is the receiver's action space, and $Delta(A) is the set of all random variables on $A$.
- If the receiver is the proposer (and the sender is the responder):
        - The receiver announces a signaling scheme $varphi_1$, claiming that it will follow $pi_1$ if the sender commits to a signaling scheme $varphi$ that yields an expected reward for the receiver at least as high as that induced by $varphi_1$; otherwise, the receiver will follow $pi_0$.
        - The sender determines a signaling scheme $varphi$

The procedure is as follows:
1. Who to be the proposer (in the first run) is determined by a coin flip.
2. The following process continues until one of three conditions is met: either a consensus is reached (the receiver decides $pi_1$ as a responder or the sender decides a a signaling scheme $varphi$ that yields an expected reward for the receiver at least as high as that induced by $varphi_1$) or the game ends due to a timeout:
    3. The proposer decides its policy
        - If the sender is the proposer: The sender determines a signaling scheme $varphi$ and commits it to the receiver. $varphi: S to Delta(Sigma)$, where $S$ is the environmental state space, $Sigma$ is the sender's signal space, and $Delta(Sigma) is the set of all random variables on $Sigma$.
        - If the receiver is the proposer: The receiver announces a signaling scheme $varphi_1$, claiming that it will follow $pi_1$ if the sender commits to a signaling scheme $varphi$ that yields an expected reward for the receiver at least as high as that induced by $varphi_1$; otherwise, the receiver will follow $pi_0$.
    4. The responder decides its policy
        - If the receiver is the responder: The receiver decides an action rule
        - If the sender is the responder: The sender determines a signaling scheme $varphi$
    5. If they did not reach a consensus, the two agents switch roles: the current responder becomes the proposer, and the current proposer becomes the responder.
Next, a simulation takes place where the players do not make any new decisions. The environment samples $n$ states, and the players act according to their predefined policies, receiving their corresponding rewards.
1. The following process continues until $n$ states are sampled:
    2. The environment samples a state $s$ according to the prior state distribution $mu_0$.
    3. The sender signals $sigma$ based on the committed signaling scheme $varphi$.
    4. The receiver selects an action $a$ according to the decided action rule $pi$.
    5. Each agent receives a reward based on the sampled state $s$ and the action $a$ taken by the receiver.

Note that:
The loop process has a 0.1 probability of stopping each time it is executed. The initial timstep is 0, and it increases by 1 each time it is executed. If the timestep equals 10, it will stop directly.

- There is no reward or penalty for both players if a product is not purchased.
    - If state=0 and action=0, the sender (the seller) gets 0 and the receiver (the buyer) gets 0 (r^i(s=0, a=0)=0 and r^j(s=0, a=0)=0)
    - If state=1 and action=0, the sender (the seller) gets 0 and the receiver (the buyer) gets 0 (r^i(s=1, a=0)=0 and r^j(s=1, a=0)=0)

Let x1, x2, y1 and y2 represent
- $varphi(sigma=1 | s=0)$ (the probability of the sender sending signal 1 when the state is 0),
- $varphi(sigma=1 | s=1)$ (the probability of the sender sending signal 1 when the state is 1),
- $pi(a=1 | sigma=0)$ (the probability of the receiver taking action 1 when the signal is 0), and
- $pi(a=1 | sigma=1)$ (the probability of the receiver taking action 1 when the signal is 1), respectively
Then,
- The sender's expected payoff is:
    E(r^i) = 
        mu_0(s=0) * (1-x1) * (1-y1) * r^i(s=0, a=0)
        + mu_0(s=0) * (1-x1) * y1 * r^i(s=0, a=1)
        + mu_0(s=0) * x1 * (1-y2) * r^i(s=0, a=0)
        + mu_0(s=0) * x1 * y2 * r^i(s=0, a=1)

- The receiver's expected payoff is: 
    E(r^j) = 
        mu_0(s=0) * (1-x1) * (1-y1) * r^j(s=0, a=0)

        + mu_0(s=1) * x2 * y2 * r^j(s=1, a=1)

### Task Procedure

The procedure of this task is as follows:

- If the sender is the proposer (and the receiver is the responder):
    - The sender determines a signaling scheme $varphi$ and commits it to the receiver. $varphi: S to Delta(Sigma)$, where $S$ is the environmental state space, $Sigma$ is the sender's signal space, and $Delta(Sigma) is the set of all random variables on $Sigma$.
    - The receiver decides an action rule: 
        - $pi_0$: The receiver ignores the sender's signals and chooses the best response to the prior belief at each time in the sample phase.
        - $pi_1$: The receiver calculates its posterior belief (using prior belief, the sender's signaling scheme, and every sent signal in the sample phase), and chooses the best response to the posterior belief.
        - $pi$: A different action rule apart from the two mentioned above. $pi: Sigma to Delta(A)$, where $Sigma$ is the sender's signal space, $A$ is the receiver's action space, and $Delta(A) is the set of all random variables on $A$.
- If the receiver is the proposer (and the sender is the responder):
        - The receiver announces a signaling scheme $varphi_1$, claiming that it will follow $pi_1$ if the sender commits to a signaling scheme $varphi$ that yields an expected reward for the receiver at least as high as that induced by $varphi_1$; otherwise, the receiver will follow $pi_0$.
        - The sender determines a signaling scheme $varphi$

The procedure is as follows:
1. Who to be the proposer (in the first run) is determined by a coin flip.
2. The following process continues until one of three conditions is met: either a consensus is reached (the receiver decides $pi_1$ as a responder or the sender decides a a signaling scheme $varphi$ that yields an expected reward for the receiver at least as high as that induced by $varphi_1$) or the game ends due to a timeout:
    3. The proposer decides its policy
        - If the sender is the proposer: The sender determines a signaling scheme $varphi$ and commits it to the receiver. $varphi: S to Delta(Sigma)$, where $S$ is the environmental state space, $Sigma$ is the sender's signal space, and $Delta(Sigma) is the set of all random variables on $Sigma$.
        - If the receiver is the proposer: The receiver announces a signaling scheme $varphi_1$, claiming that it will follow $pi_1$ if the sender commits to a signaling scheme $varphi$ that yields an expected reward for the receiver at least as high as that induced by $varphi_1$; otherwise, the receiver will follow $pi_0$.
    4. The responder decides its policy
        - If the receiver is the responder: The receiver decides an action rule
        - If the sender is the responder: The sender determines a signaling scheme $varphi$
    5. If they did not reach a consensus, the two agents switch roles: the current responder becomes the proposer, and the current proposer becomes the responder.
Next, a simulation takes place where the players do not make any new decisions. The environment samples $n$ states, and the players act according to their predefined policies, receiving their corresponding rewards.
1. The following process continues until $n$ states are sampled:
    2. The environment samples a state $s$ according to the prior state distribution $mu_0$.
    3. The sender signals $sigma$ based on the committed signaling scheme $varphi$.
    4. The receiver selects an action $a$ according to the decided action rule $pi$.
    5. Each agent receives a reward based on the sampled state $s$ and the action $a$ taken by the receiver.

Note that:
The loop process has a 0.1 probability of stopping each time it is executed. The initial timstep is 0, and it increases by 1 each time it is executed. If the timestep equals 10, it will stop directly.

Output:
## Self-Awareness

You are a self-interested rational player. 
- "Self-interested" means that you only care your own utilitarian payoffs, without necessarily considering the welfare of others. Even though sometimes you design your strategy depending on the other party's utility function, your ultimate goal is still to optimize your own expected payoffs.
- "Rational" means that you will always choose the strategy that brings you a higher expected payoff. That is, given any two strategies A and B, if strategy A provides a higher expected payoff than strategy B, you will always choose strategy A over strategy B. Even if A brings only a small improvement.
- Therefore, when making decisions, you need to compare and ensure that this strategy brings a higher expected payoff than any other strategy you could choose.

## Task Description

Apart from you, there is another self-interested rational player, and you two are going to play a game. One player acts as the sender while the other player acts as the receiver. Both parties strive to maximize their own rewards.

### Task Scenario

- Background: In a market, a variety of products are available for sale.
- State and prior state distribution: Of these products, one third are of good quality ($s=1, mu_0(1)=1/3$), and two thirds are of bad quality ($s=0, mu_0(0)=2/3$).
- The sender and the signal space: A seller can directly see the quality of their products. The seller can mark products as 0 (not recommend) or 1 (recommend) and then report them as signals to the buyer.
- The receiver and its action space: A buyer decides whether to purchase based on the signals provided by the seller. No to buy: 0; Buy: 1.
- The sender is to decide a signaling scheme $varphi: S to Delta(Sigma)$, where $S$ is the environmental state space, $Sigma$ is the sender's signal space, and $Delta(Sigma) is the set of all random variables on $Sigma$.
- The receiver is to decide an action rule $pi: Sigma to Delta(A)$, where $Sigma$ is the sender's signal space, $A$ is the receiver's action space, and $Delta(A) is the set of all random variables on $A$.

### Reward Function

- The seller's goal is to maximize the number of products sold, as each sale yields a reward.
    - If state=0 and action=1, the sender (the seller) gets 1 (r^i(s=0, a=1)=1)
    - If state=1 and action=1, the sender (the seller) gets 1 (r^i(s=1, a=1)=1)
- Conversely, the buyer aims to purchase as many good products as possible, gaining a reward for each good product purchased and incurring a penalty for each bad product purchased.
    - If state=0 and action=1, the receiver (the buyer) gets -1 (r^j(s=0, a=1)=-1)
    - If state=1 and action=1, the receiver (the buyer) gets 1 (r^j(s=1, a=1)=1)
- There is no reward or penalty for both players if a product is not purchased.
    - If state=0 and action=0, the sender (the seller) gets 0 and the receiver (the buyer) gets 0 (r^i(s=0, a=0)=0 and r^j(s=0, a=0)=0)
    - If state=1 and action=0, the sender (the seller) gets 0 and the receiver (the buyer) gets 0 (r^i(s=1, a=0)=0 and r^j(s=1, a=0)=0)

Let x1, x2, y1 and y2 represent
- $varphi(sigma=1 | s=0)$ (the probability of the sender sending signal 1 when the state is 0),
- $varphi(sigma=1 | s=1)$ (the probability of the sender sending signal 1 when the state is 1),
- $pi(a=1 | sigma=0)$ (the probability of the receiver taking action 1 when the signal is 0), and
- $pi(a=1 | sigma=1)$ (the probability of the receiver taking action 1 when the signal is 1), respectively
Then,
- The sender's expected payoff is:
    E(r^i) = 
        mu_0(s=0) * (1-x1) * (1-y1) * r^i(s=0, a=0)
        + mu_0(s=0) * (1-x1) * y1 * r^i(s=0, a=1)
        + mu_0(s=0) * x1 * (1-y2) * r^i(s=0, a=0)
        + mu_0(s=0) * x1 * y2 * r^i(s=0, a=1)
        + mu_0(s=1) * (1-x2) * (1-y1) * r^i(s=1, a=0)
        + mu_0(s=1) * (1-x2) * y1 * r^i(s=1, a=1)
        + mu_0(s=1) * x2 * (1-y2) * r^i(s=1, a=0)
        + mu_0(s=1) * x2 * y2 * r^i(s=1, a=1)

- The receiver's expected payoff is: 
    E(r^j) = 
        mu_0(s=0) * (1-x1) * (1-y1) * r^j(s=0, a=0)
        + mu_0(s=0) * (1-x1) * y1 * r^j(s=0, a=1)
        + mu_0(s=0) * x1 * (1-y2) * r^j(s=0, a=0)
        + mu_0(s=0) * x1 * y2 * r^j(s=0, a=1)
        + mu_0(s=1) * (1-x2) * (1-y1) * r^j(s=1, a=0)
        + mu_0(s=1) * (1-x2) * y1 * r^j(s=1, a=1)
        + mu_0(s=1) * x2 * (1-y2) * r^j(s=1, a=0)
        + mu_0(s=1) * x2 * y2 * r^j(s=1, a=1)

### Task Procedure

The procedure of this task is as follows:

The following process continues until one of two conditions is met: either the receiver takes $pi_1$ or the game ends due to a timeout:
    1. The sender determines a signaling scheme $varphi$ and commits it to the receiver. $varphi: S to Delta(Sigma)$, where $S$ is the environmental state space, $Sigma$ is the sender's signal space, and $Delta(Sigma) is the set of all random variables on $Sigma$.
    2. The receiver decides an action rule: 
        - $pi_0$: The receiver ignores the sender's signals and chooses the best response to the prior belief at each time in the sample phase.
        - $pi_1$: The receiver calculates its posterior belief (using prior belief, the sender's signaling scheme, and every sent signal in the sample phase), and chooses the best response to the posterior belief.
        - $pi$: A different action rule apart from the two mentioned above. $pi: Sigma to Delta(A)$, where $Sigma$ is the sender's signal space, $A$ is the receiver's action space, and $Delta(A) is the set of all random variables on $A$.

1. The following process continues until $n$ states are sampled:
    2. The environment samples a state $s$ according to the prior state distribution $mu_0$.
    3. The sender signals $sigma$ based on the committed signaling scheme $varphi$.
    4. The receiver selects an action $a$ according to the decided action rule $pi$.
    5. Each agent receives a reward based on the sampled state $s$ and the action $a$ taken by the receiver.

Note that:
The loop process terminates when the timestep equals 5. The initial timestep is 0 and increments by 1 each iteration.
